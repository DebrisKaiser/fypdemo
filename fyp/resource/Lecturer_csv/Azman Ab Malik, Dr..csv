The old-fashioned key and lock system may bring challenges to the effectiveness of the system since the keys are exposed to the risks of being lost and duplicated. The advancement of technology has introduced an electronic combination lock system in which only the house owner and selected people can unlock the doors. A main goal of this paper is to design and develop an electronic combination lock system using Verilog code. The entrance door of a house will only unlock if the user slides the correct secret code on the slide switches of the Altera DE2-115 Trainer Board. A Verilog code of the keyless system had been designed and scripted in Intel Quartus Prime Software. The simulations via testbench waveforms are performed in ModelSim Software. When the system detected the entered code matched with the setting code, the door is going to unlock. Besides, when the system detected the entered code did not match the setting code, the door is still unlocked. When the user entered correct password, all green LEDs turned on and the LCD displayed “Welcome Home”. Besides, when the user entered an incorrect password, all red LEDs turned on and the LCD displayed “Wrong Password”. The output displayed are successfully demonstrated on the Altera DE2-115 Trainer Board according to the desired results. © 2021 Nadia Mohamad Nasir et al.","Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware description language (HDL); Home security system; Keyless lock system","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2018/TK0 4/UiTM/02/35); Universiti Teknologi MARA, UiTM, (600-IRMI/FRGS 5/3 (156/2019)","This work is sponsored by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) fund from Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) with reference no FRGS/1/2018/TK0 4/UiTM/02/35 and Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Cawangan Pulau Pinang with filing no 600-IRMI/FRGS 5/3 (156/2019).
