WSN has a broad range of important applications such as environmental monitoring, health monitoring, and various industrial and military applications. The various routing protocols in WSN manage the load balance, energy consumption and the expansion of the network. This study outlines the procedure of developing scalable, low energy and highly adaptive clustering hierarchy routing protocol. The main objective is to maintain the network lifespan over the network expansion. We refer to the proposed protocol as Energy-Efficient Scalable Routing Algorithm (EESRA). The EESRA protocol is expected to optimize the well-known LEACH protocol for more energy efficiency on a large scale WSN. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

However, the seamless connectivity in different IP networks has introduced new security vulnerabilities. One of the most critical concerns with the IPv6 is IPv6 routing header. IPv6 routing header can be used by an IPv6 source to list one or more intermediate hosts to be visited on the way to a packet's destination. Nevertheless, the feature of IPv6 routing header which has serious vulnerability can be used by attacker to bypass security policies applied on filtering devices such as firewall. This study analyzes the IPv6 routing header feature which can be exploited by attackers to access the protected hosts/networks. Thus, the current study provides a comprehensive view regarding the scenario of attackers within the different IP wireless networks which in turn provide the researchers and practitioners with the threats of attackers. The scenario analysis also leads to developing new mechanisms for covering the security problem of routing header type 0/2 which is still under investigation. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

However, it does not provide authentication, which may lead to possible impersonation and eavesdropping threats. Negotiating keys using digital certificates may help secure the channel, but this method incurs extra maintenance cost. Verbal authentication utilizes the real-time nature of VoIP but it requires users to read and manually compare the authentication code. This study proposes a session identifier framework based on the Modified Vector Quantization (MVQ) method on real-time video frames for video communication in VoIP. After the selected image frames are averaged and quantized, the output of the MVQ process is a set of image metrics that serves as pre-shared keys for key agreement. The framework is certificate-less and users do not need to read the authentication code to the other user. The implementation is evaluated for accuracy and robustness towards network noise and frame conditions.","Cryptography; Eavesdropping; Multimedia security; VoIP","Authentication; Cryptography; Internet telephony; Security systems; Voice/data communication systems; Authentication codes; Digital certificates; Eavesdropping; Multimedia security; Session identifiers; Session initiation protocol; Video communications; VoIP; Vector quantization","","","","","","","Dantu R., Fahmy S., Schulzrinne H., Cangussu J., Issues and challenges in securing VoIP, Computers & Security, 28, pp. 743-753, (2009); Spalding M., Deciding whether or not to use a third party certificate authority, Network Security, 2000, pp. 7-8, (2000); Wang C.-H., Liu Y.-S., A dependable privacy protection for end-to-end VoIP via Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman and dynamic key changes, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, (2010); Liao Y.-P., Wang S.-S., A new secure password authenticated key agreement scheme for SIP using self-certified public keys on elliptic curves, Computer Communications, 33, pp. 372-380, (2010); Yoon E.-J., Yoo K.-Y., Kim C., Hong Y.-S., Jo M., Chen H.-H., A secure and efficient SIP authentication scheme for converged VoIP networks, Computer Communications, 33, pp. 1674-1681, (2010); Zimmerman P., ZRTP: Extensions to RTP for Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement for SRTP, IETF Internet Draft, (2006); Zisiadis D., Kopsidas S., Tassiulas L., VIPSec defined, Computer Networks, 52, pp. 2518-2528, (2008); Hoque S., Fairhurst M., Howells G., Deravi F., Feasibility of generating biometric encryption keys, Electronics Letters, 41, pp. 309-311, (2005); Butcher D., Xiangyang L., Jinhua G., Security Challenge and Defense in VoIP Infrastructures, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, 37, pp. 1152-1162, (2007); Zhe C., Shize G., Kangfeng Z., Haitao L., Research on Man-in-the-Middle Denial of Service Attack in SIP VoIP, International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing, NSWCTC '09, pp. 263-266, (2009); Prowell S., Kraus R., Borkin M., CHAPTER 6-Man-in-the-Middle, Seven Deadliest Network Attacks, pp. 101-120, (2010); Petraschek M., Hoeher T., Jung O., Hlavacs H., Gansterer W., Security and usability aspects of man-in-the-middle attacks on ZRTP, Journal of Universal Computer Science, 14, pp. 673-692, (2008); Bresciani R., Butterfield A., A formal security proof for the ZRTP Protocol, International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions, ICITST '09, pp. 1-6, (2009)","","","","","","","","","19750080","","","","English","Int.

However, nearly 90% of the causes of recurrent stroke are modifiable, which means recurrent strokes can be averted by controlling risk factors, which are mainly behavioral and metabolic in nature. Thus, it shows that from the previous works that recurrent stroke prediction model could help in minimizing the possibility of getting recurrent stroke. Previous works have shown promising results in predicting first-time stroke cases with machine learning approaches. However, there are limited works on recurrent stroke prediction using machine learning methods. Hence, this work is proposed to perform an empirical analysis and to investigate machine learning algorithms implementation in the recurrent stroke prediction models. This research aims to investigate and compare the performance of machine learning algorithms using recurrent stroke clinical public datasets. In this study, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Bayesian Rule List (BRL) are used and compared their performance in the domain of recurrent stroke prediction model. The result of the empirical experiments shows that ANN scores the highest accuracy at 80.00%, follows by BRL with 75.91% and SVM with 60.45%. © 2021 University of Baghdad.

However, the consumer adoption of home automation systems has been immensely slow. Moreover, most home automation systems available in the market are designed for western countries and do not have certain features that are crucial for consumers in tropical countries like Malaysia. Therefore, this paper identifies the possible criteria for this slow adoption and evaluates the potential of Intel Galileo for addressing these problems. Four popular home automation technologies are analysed and surveys are conducted to identify the needs of electricity and water consumers in Malaysia. A low cost, secure, user-friendly, easily installed and flexible Intel Galileo based home automation system that caters the needs of Malaysians is presented. The system is integrated with an Android application and uses a Wi-Fi network. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system, the design and prototype implementation of a basic home automation system based on the Intel Galileo is developed and evaluated based on several tests and interviews. The proposed system can be used as a reference to increase consumer adoption of home automation systems in tropical countries. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

If this platform is fully utilized by farmers, it can improve the sustainability of farmers in agriculture industry because it can improve sales volume and fair price for farmers and consumers. However, the current AgroBazaar Online has a few enhancements that can be proposed to improve the acceptance from farmers and consumers. Therefore, there is a need to design the system that can encourage target users to use the system and make the system easy to be used by farmers who relatively have lower ICT literacy. The main requirement to develop intelligent marketing is data to provide intelligent information and services for both farmers and consumers. This project aims to explore data strategies to provide intelligent digital agricultural marketplace based on cloud data platform. This research proposes to develop cloud data platform for e-marketplace based cloud data platform approach. The proposed methodology consists of six phases: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. This paper proposes an architectural model of agriculture marketplace cloud based on cloud data platform. The architectural model will be used for development of e-marketplace that fulfil the Malaysia's IR 4.0 policy and National Agro-Food Policy (NAFP).  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Agricultural robots; Architecture; Commerce; Agriculture industries; Architectural modeling; Design and Development; Digital marketplace; E-marketplaces; Intelligent information; Problem identification; Sales volume; Agriculture","","","","","","","Isa I.

For example, text sort is used in finance to update stock market data. Text data processing consumes huge amounts of memory for storage and computation purposes. Hence we propose a technique to sort huge text data which combines the Radix sort algorithm and the Bucket sort algorithm to obtain a scalable, parallel, and efficient sorting method which can be applied on multiple Graphic Processor Unit (GPU) cards. The basic idea is to divide the text data into multiple buckets and then sort individual buckets in different GPUs in parallel eventually merging the sorted bucket into a final sorted result. On individual GPUs, we will implement Radix sort which will convert text (ASCII) into integers and perform sorting using this algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.","Bucket Sort; CUDA; GPGPU; Multiple GPU; Radix sort","Control systems; Digital storage; Electronic trading; Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Bucket sort; CUDA; GPGPU; Graphic processor units; Radix sort; Sorting method; Text data; Sorting","","","","","","","Apache Software, (2012); Satish N., Harris M., Garland M., Designing efficient sorting algorithms for manycore gpus,"" in, Parallel & Distributed Processing1 2009.

However, security and privacy challenges are serious issues in smart grid environment due to a myriad of heterogeneous appliances that interconnect with the grid system. Consequently, many security and privacy preservation schemes have been developed based on techniques such as elliptic curve cryptography, blockchains, homomorphic encryption, public key certificates and bilinear pairing operations among others. However, these schemes have numerous performance and security constraints. In addition, some of these protocols require tamper proof devices which ride on unrealistic security assumptions. In this paper, a symmetric key based scheme for verification token generation is developed for internet of things communication environment. Extensive performance evaluation is executed in terms of computation, communication and space complexities. The results show that the proposed scheme has relatively low storage complexity, and the least computation and communication complexities. This renders it applicable in smart grid communication environment. In terms of security and privacy, a number of hypotheses are formulated and proofed to show that this scheme is secure under both the Dolev-Yao (DY) and the Canetti-Krawczyk threat models. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Authentication; IoT; Key agreement; Pseudonymity; Time-stamping","Electric power transmission networks; Internet of things; Network security; Public key cryptography; Communication complexity; Communication environments; Computation complexity; IoT; Key agreement; Pseudonymity; Security and privacy; Smart grid; Symmetric keys; Timestamping; Smart power grids","","","","","","","Gai N., Xue K., Zhu B., Yang J., Liu J., He D., An efficient data aggregation scheme with local differential privacy in smart grid, Digit.

The main task of the cryptographic hash function is to assure the integrity of the transmitted data. In this work, integrity verification methods for digital verses of the Holy Quran are proposed. The first method uses cryptographic hash functions and generate the hash table of the Holy Quran. SHA256 and RIPEMD160 hash functions are chosen in this work. The second method is a single compression technique which manipulates data during the run time. The compression method makes use of the two bytes in Unicode UTF-8 for the Arabic characters set. The results show that for a digital copy of the Holy Quran encoded in Unicode UTF-8, the sizes of the hash tables generated by SHA256 and RIPEMD160 are 84.73% and 90.46% (6.55-fold and 10.48-fold) smaller respectively. The compressed version of the Holy Quran has a size of 47.24% (1.9-fold) smaller than the original copy. In addition, a second preimage attack on a hash table for the digital Holy Quran produced by using CRC32 hash function is conducted to study the impact of such attacks on the two hash tables proposed in this work. © 2018 The Authors","Authentication; Cryptography; Data integrity; Hash function; Holy Quran","","","","","","","","pp. 250-253, (2013); (2014); Alginahi Y.M., Tayan O., Kabir M.N., Verification of Qur'anic Quotations Embedded in Online Arabic and Islamic Websites, Int.

In severe forms, it can lead to death. This genetic disorder has posed a major burden on public health wherein patients with severe thalassemia need periodic therapy of iron chelation and blood transfusion for survival. Therefore, controlling thalassemia is extremely important and is made by promoting screening to the general population, particularly among thalassemia carriers. Today Twitter is one of the most influential social media platforms for sharing opinions and discussing different topics like people’s health conditions and major public health affairs. Exploring individuals’ sentiments in these tweets helps the research centers to formulate strategies to promote thalassemia screening to the public. An effective Lexicon-based approach has been introduced in this study by highlighting a classifier called valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoning (VADER). In this study applied twitter intelligence tool (TWINT), Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), and VADER constitute the three main tools. VADER represents a gold-standard sentiment lexicon, which is basically tailored to attitudes that are communicated by using social media. The contribution of this study is to introduce an effective Lexicon-based approach by highlighting a classifier called VADER to analyze the sentiment of the general population, particularly among thalassemia carriers on the social media platform Twitter. In this study, the results showed that the proposed approach achieved 0.829, 0.816, and 0.818 regarding precision, recall, together with F-score, respectively. The tweets were crawled using the search keywords, “thalassemia screening,” thalassemia test, “and thalassemia diagnosis”. Finally, results showed that India and Pakistan ranked the highest in mentions in tweets by the public’s conversations on thalassemia screening with 181 and 164 tweets, respectively. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

A new algorithm is introduced that combines the add-subtract scalar multiplication algorithm with the MOF representation to speed-up the ECC scalar multiplication. The implementation of the algorithm produces an efficient parallel method that improves the computation time. The proposed method is an efficient ECC scalar multiplication that achieves a 90% speed-up compared to the existing methods.","Circular buffer; Elliptic curve cryptography; Mutual opposite form; Parallel computing","","","","","","","","Al-Daoud E., An Improved Implementation of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature by Using Sparse Elements, The International Arab Journal of Information Technology, 1, 2, pp. 203-208, (2004); Al-Somani T., Ibrahim M., Generic-Point Parallel Scalar Multiplication without Precomputation, IEICE Electronics Express, 6, pp. 1732-1736, (2009); Ansari B., Wu H., Parallel Scalar Multiplication for Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems, International Conference on Communications, pp. 71-73, (2005); Balasubramaniam P., Karthikeyan E., Fast simultaneous scalar Multiplication, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 192, 2, pp. 399-404, (2007); Gutub A., Remodeling of Elliptic Curve Cryptography Scalar Multiplication Architecture using Parallel Jacobian Coordinate System, International Journal of Computer Science and Security (IJCSS), 4, 4, pp. 409-425, (2010); Huang X., Shah P., Sharma D., Minimizing Hamming Weight Based on l's Complement Of Binary Numbers Over GF(2<sup>m</sup>), The Journal of VLSI Signal Processing, pp. 1226-1230, (2010); Izu T., Takagi T., A Fast Parallel Elliptic Curve Multiplication Resistant Against Side Channel Attacks, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2274, pp. 280-296, (2002); Koblitz N., Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem, Mathematics of Computation, 48, 173, pp. 203-209, (1987); Miller V., Use of Elliptic Curves in Cryptography Advances, Cryptology-Crypto'85.

The purpose of a security warning is to provide a legitimate alert (to notify and to warn) to the users so that a secure manner of action is safely conducted. It is worth noting that the majority of computer users prefer to dismiss security warnings due to lack of attention, the use of technical words, and the deficiency of information provided. This paper determines to achieve two outcomes: firstly, a thorough review of problems, challenges, and approaches to improving security warnings. Our work complements the previous classifications in the identification of problems and challenges in security warnings by value-adding a new classification, namely immersion in the primary task. Then, we add other related works within the known classifications accordingly. In addition, our work also presents the classifications of approaches to improving security warnings. Secondly, we propose two timelines by addressing the problems, challenges, and approaches to improving security warnings. It is expected that the outcomes of this research will be useful to researchers within the niche area for analysing trends and providing the groundwork in security warning studies, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

A reliable security protocol and an authentication scheme are thus required to prevent the aforementioned threats. However, an authentication scheme often demands additional cost and effort. Accordingly, a security framework for known participants in VoIP communication is proposed in this paper. The framework is known as Randomness-Optimized Self-Securing (ROSS), which performs authentication automatically throughout the session by optimizing the uniqueness and randomness of the communication itself. Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange and Salsa20 stream cipher are utilized in the framework correspondingly to secure the key agreement and the communication with low computational cost.

In order to fulfill this role, it requires collaboration with other government agencies and businesses to provide an effective one-stop center for users to access and perform various services. Current e-government portals are mostly lack of interoperability whereby users still need to access government services from various portals or websites. Interoperability is a technical requirement to achieve government services collaboration and integration. There are many challenges and approaches to achieve better interoperability in e-government portals. Architecture-based and model-based approaches are essential research areas that can improve interoperability starting from the planning stages. Architecture provides overall overview of e-government components and relationship between components.

Since the performance of LEACH deteriorates sharply with increasing network size, the challenge for new WSN protocols is to extend the network lifespan while maintaining high scalability. This paper introduces an energy-efficient clustering and hierarchical routing algorithm named energy-efficient scalable routing algorithm (EESRA). The goal of the proposed algorithm is to extend the network lifespan despite an increase in network size. The algorithm adopts a three-layer hierarchy to minimize the cluster heads' load and randomize the selection of cluster heads. Moreover, EESRA uses multi-hop transmissions for intra-cluster communications to implement a hybrid WSN MAC protocol. This paper compares EESRA against other WSN routing protocols in terms of network performance with respect to changes in the network size. The simulation results show that EESRA outperforms the benchmarked protocols in terms of load balancing and energy efficiency on large-scale WSNs. © 2013 IEEE.","Energy efficiency; LEACH; load balancing; scalability; wireless sensor networks","Clustering algorithms; Energy efficiency; Internet protocols; Leaching; Low power electronics; Medium access control; Power management (telecommunication); Resource allocation; Routing algorithms; Routing protocols; Scalability; Energy efficient; Energy Efficient clustering; Hierarchical routing algorithm; High scalabilities; Intra-cluster communication; Low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchies; Multihop transmission; Wsn routing protocols; Wireless sensor networks","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work was supported in part by the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).","Liu X., Atypical hierarchical routing Protocols for wireless sensor net-works: A review, IEEE Sensors J., 15, 10, pp. 5372-5383, (2015); Gherbi C., Aliouat Z., Benmohammed M., A survey on clustering routing Protocols in wireless sensor networks, Sens.

To make use of this data effectively, efficient techniques for collecting, storing and managing data are needed. In this paper, we present a health big data indexing technique that allows for the efficient storage, querying and management of tele-rehabilitation related big data collected via health sensors connected to client machines accessing web-based e-Health frameworks.
