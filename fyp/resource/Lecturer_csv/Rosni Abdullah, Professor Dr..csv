The nature of intrusion attempts appears to be nonlinear, wherein the network traffic performance is unpredictable, and the problematic space features are numerous. These make intrusion detection systems (IDSs) a challenge within the research arena. Hence, selecting the essential aspects for intrusion detection is crucial in information security and with that, this study identified the related features in building a computationally efficient and effective intrusion system. Accordingly, a modified feature selection (FS) algorithm called modified binary grey wolf optimisation (MBGWO) is proposed in this study. The proposed algorithm is based on binary grey wolf optimisation to boost the performance of IDS. The new FS algorithm selected an optimal number of features. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, the benchmark of NSL-KDD network intrusion, which was modified from 99-data set KDD cup to assess issues linked with IDS, had been applied in this study. Additionally, the support vector machine was employed to classify the data set effectively. The proposed FS and classification algorithms enhanced the performance of the IDS in detecting attacks. The simulation outcomes portrayed that the proposed algorithm enhanced the accuracy of intrusion detection up to 99.22% and reduction in the number of features from 41 to 14. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Anomaly-based detection; Grey wolf optimisation; Intrusion detection system; Modified binary grey wolf optimisation","Classification (of information); Computer crime; Feature extraction; Network security; Support vector machines; Anomaly based detection; Classification algorithm; Computationally efficient; Detecting attacks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network intrusions; Network traffic; Optimisations; Intrusion detection","","","","","","","Kim G., Lee S., Kim S., A novel hybrid intrusion detection method integrating anomaly detection with misuse detection, Expert Syst Appl, 41, 4, pp. 1690-1700, (2014); Anbar M., Abdullah R., Hasbullah I.H., Chong Y.W., Elejla O.E., Comparative performance analysis of classification algorithms for intrusion detection system, 2016 14Th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST), pp. 282-288, (2016); Hamed T., Ernst J.B., Kremer S.C., A survey and taxonomy on data and pre-processing techniques of intrusion detection systems.

IPv6 needed a number of protocols such as the Address Auto-configuration scheme and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6), IPv6 is vulnerable to numerous attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), DDoS is one of the most dangerous attacks carried out through ICMPv6 messages that impose security and pecuniary implications. Therefore, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a monitoring system of the security of a network that detects suspicious activities and deals with a massive amount of data comprised of repetitive and inappropriate features which affect the detection rate. A feature selection technique helps to reduce the computation time and complexity by selecting the optimum subset of features. This paper proposes a method for detecting ICMPv6 DDoS attacks using a modified Flower Pollination Algorithm (MFPA). The main purpose of the proposed method, first MFPA is to select the most relevant features from the ICMPv6 dataset to the detect ICMPv6 DDoS attacks. Second, an enhanced detecting DDoS flooding attacks model based on a multi-objective FPA has proposed. The results show that the first proposed method (MFPA) achieved the best accuracy equal to 97.96% with 10 features and the second proposed method Multi-Objective FPA achieved the best accuracy 97.01% with 5 features. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process is the most common method used to grow CNTs. However, the growing process suffers many difficulties in finding the optimal process parameters. Applying computational intelligence methods is a possible solution for optimization problems to reduce using conventional methods and experimental runs. In this work, a combination between bat algorithm (BA) and response surface methodology (RSM) is proposed to solve CNTs process parameters optimization problem. The study aims to maximize the CNTs yield percentage for mass production in two different datasets. BA search process is based on the objective function developed by RSM which represents the prediction mathematical model of growing process parameters. The optimized parameters from datasets are reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst weight, and methane partial pressure. The algorithm search process was conducted with parameters tuning at different setting values to improve the algorithm’s performance and CNTs yield value. Different evaluation metrics were applied to compare the experimental results. The results have shown that BA has an efficient search performance and obtained better CNTs yield result than RSM in one of the datasets with 21% improvement of CNTs yield value. Besides, BA has shown a fast and stable convergence.

Grammars called context-free triangle-tiled picture grammars (CF- ttPG) that generate such figures making use of context-free type rules, are proposed. The special case that all rules of such a grammar are regular, is studied. In the framework of membrane computing which is a biologically inspired computability model, generation of triangle-tiled pictures by rules of a CF-ttPG is considered. The picture language of rectangular hollow frames which cannot be generated by any CF-ttPG, can be generated by a specific type of P system with two membranes.","Context-free grammar; Figure decomposed by triangles; P system; Picture generation by grammars; Picture grammar; Rectangular hollow frame; Triangle-tiled picture","","","","","","","","Annadurai S., Thomas D.G., Dare V.R., Kalyani T., Rewriting P systems generating iso picture languages, LNCS, 4958, pp. 352-362, (2008); Annadurai S., Thomas D.G., Dare V.R., Kalyani T., T-communicating isoarray P system, Proc.

Devices with significant computational capabilities and those that are transformed into intelligent objects are used to monitor and gather information about the environment of a city, thereby leading to smart cities. The most important problem that is currently experienced by smart cities is waste management problem. The following factors directly affect this problem: an increase in urban areas and rapid population growth. Intelligent services can function as the frontline in obtaining information regarding every aspect of human activities. A typical example of a service provided by smart cities is waste management supported by IoT. Waste management involves different responsibilities, such as the collection, disposal, and utilization of waste in relevant facilities. A review of common waste management models is presented in this paper. Then, an enhanced waste management design is proposed. This design considers and deals with population and urban growth by using different truck sizes according to waste type and IoT devices that ease communication among system entities, such as smart bins, waste source areas, waste collection trucks, and waste management centers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","IoT; Smart city; Waste management","Bins; Population statistics; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Smart city; Soft computing; Solid wastes; Trucks; Urban growth; Waste disposal; Waste management; Computational capability; Intelligent devices; Intelligent Services; Internet of thing (IOT); Management problems; Radio frequency identification tags; Rapid population growth; Waste management systems; Internet of things","","","","","","","Boonrod K., Towprayoon S., Bonnet S., Tripetchkul S., Enhancing organic waste separation at the source behavior: A case study of the application of motivation mechanisms in communities in Thailand, Resour.

As no company can escape the effects of the pandemic, mature Big Data and analytics practices are essential for successful decision-making insights and keeping pace with a changing and unpredictable marketplace. The ability to be successful in Big Data projects is related to the organization’s maturity level. The maturity model is a tool that could be applied to assess the maturity level across specific key dimensions, where the maturity levels indicate an organization’s current capabilities and the desirable state. Big Data maturity models (BDMMs) are a new trend with limited publications published as white papers and web materials by practitioners. While most of the related literature might not have covered all of the existing BDMMs, this systematic literature review (SLR) aims to contribute to the body of knowledge and address the limitations in the existing literature about the existing BDMMs, assessment dimensions, and tools. The SLR strategy in this paper was conducted based on guidelines to perform SLR in software engineering by answering three research questions: (1) What are the existing maturity assessment models for Big Data? (2) What are the assessment dimensions for Big Data maturity models? and (3) What are the assessment tools for Big Data maturity models? This SLR covers the available BDMMs written in English and developed by academics and practitioners (2007–2022). By applying a descriptive qualitative content analysis method for the reviewed publications, this SLR identified 15 BDMMs (10 BDMMs by practitioners and 5 BDMMs by academics). Additionally, this paper presents the limitations of existing BDMMs. The findings of this paper could be used as a grounded reference for assessing the maturity of Big Data. Moreover, this paper will provide managers with critical insights to select the BDMM that fits within their organization to support their data-driven decisions. Future work will investigate the Big Data maturity assessment dimensions towards developing a new Big Data maturity model. © 2022 by the authors.","big data; big data analytics; big data maturity model; capability maturity model (CMM); COVID-19 pandemic; critical success factors; maturity model; readiness assessment; systematic literature review","Big data; Data Analytics; Decision making; Software engineering; Big data analytic; Big data maturity model; Capability maturity model; Capability maturity models; COVID-19 pandemic; Critical success factor; Data analytics; Data maturity; Maturity model; Readiness assessment; Success factors; Systematic literature review; COVID-19","","","","","","","Rapaccini M., Saccani N., Kowalkowski C., Paiola M., Adrodegari F., Navigating disruptive crises through service-led growth: The impact of COVID-19 on Italian manufacturing firms, Ind.

Through decades of extensive research to solve the MSA problem, numerous methods have been proposed and developed. Dynamic programming-based methods suffer from the high computational cost in building MSA. Therefore researchers tend to solve MSA problem using heuristic methods as they attempt to reach optimal results in a reasonable time. Progressive alignment method is the most used method for constructing MSA. In this paper we present an extensive analysis for the leading methods and top performing methods in MSA. The leading methods of MSA are discussed individually to highlight the differences in methods and techniques they use beside the progressive alignment. Also, we present a critical analysis for MSA leading methods based on experimental results where BaliBASE database is used as a benchmark. Results show that MSAProbs algorithm has the superior accuracy performance over all leading methods while MUSCLE and Clustal W are the fastest. Although numerous algorithms have been proposed for MSA, producing an efficient MSA with high accuracy remains a huge challenge. © 2005-2015 JATIT & LLS.

Oil palm monitoring can be done by performing land cover classification using various classification methods and machine learning algorithms. This study was conducted to perform oil palm mapping using WorldView-2 satellite imagery and classify land cover features using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) and Linear Support Vector Classifier (LSVC). A total of 58609 sampling points were classified into six classes which are water, built-up, bare soil, forest, mature oil palm (≥9 years) and young oil palm (3-8 years). The training and testing samples were split using 3-fold cross-validation. 67% of the total sampling points were used for training samples whereas the other 33% were used for testing samples. The methods used to validate the data in this study is by using spectral reflectance and Google Earth Pro. Accuracy assessment was conducted after obtaining the classification output such as Overall Accuracy (OA), Kappa Accuracy (KA), Precision, Recall and F1-score. As a result, the oil palm mapping using RF has a higher accuracy than LSVC which is 72.49% for OA and 62.98% for KA. The p-value obtained from the McNemar's test conducted in this study is 0.683 (>0.05) which concludes that the predictive performance of the two models are equal. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","Malaysian Research University Network; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","The researchers would like to thank the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia for its support and resources through the Long Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS) of the Malaysian Research University Network (MRUN).

One of the main challenges of interconnectedness is the security of applications and networks from malicious actors. The security challenge is further compounded by the exponential growth of threats and the increase in attack vectors through interfaces of many newly introduced network services. To deal with the security threats, many solutions have been proposed; yet the existing solutions overwhelmingly fail to detect security threats efficiently with high performance. Accordingly, a hybridization of modified binary Grey Wolf Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization is proposed in this article. The proposed solution uses two benchmarking datasets, NSL KDD'99 and UNSW-NB15, and the results reveal that the proposed solution outperforms the existing solutions, as the proposed approach improves the detection accuracy by approximately 0.3% to 12%, and the detection rate by 2% to 12%. In addition, it reduces false alarm rates by 4% to 43%, and reduces the number of features by approximately 31% to 75%. Last, the proposed approach reduces processing time by approximately 14% to 22% compared to state-of-that-art approaches. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Grey wolf optimization; Intrusion Detection System; Particle swarm optimization;

Existing studies heavily rely on sentiment classification methods that require fully annotated inputs. However, there is limited labelled text available, making the acquirement process of the fully annotated input costly and labour-intensive. Lately, semi-supervised methods emerge as they require only partially labelled input but perform comparably to supervised methods. Nevertheless, some works reported that the performance of the semi-supervised model degraded after adding unlabelled instances into training. Literature also shows that not all unlabelled instances are equally useful; thus identifying the informative unlabelled instances is beneficial in training a semi-supervised model. To achieve this, an informative score is proposed and incorporated into semisupervised sentiment classification. The evaluation is performed on a semisupervised method without an informative score and with an informative score. By using the informative score in the instance selection strategy to identify informative unlabelled instances, semi-supervised models perform better compared to models that do not incorporate informative scores into their training. Although the performance of semi-supervised models incorporated with an informative score is not able to surpass the supervised models, the results are still found promising as the differences in performance are subtle with a small difference of 2% to 5%, but the number of labelled instances used is greatly reduced from100% to 40%. The best finding of the proposed instance selection strategy is achieved when incorporating an informative score with a baseline confidence score at a 0.5:0.5 ratio using only 40% labelled data. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

However, there are limited studies on comprehensive mapping and accurate oil palm yield prediction using advanced machine learning algorithms. Using multi-temporal remote sensing data, this paper proposed a new approach to predict oil palm yield based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ensemble machine learning algorithm. ReliefF algorithm with linear projection was employed to select the best combination of spectral indices in oil palm discrimination. Oil palm land cover was classified using random forest (RF) and modified AdaBoost algorithms. A time-series approach known as walk-forward validation was firstly introduced to train the model using the 2016-2019 data and the one-step prediction was performed for 2020 using RF and AdaBoost. Result of the study revealed that the RF model (RMSE = 0.384; MSE = 0.148; MAE = 0.147) outperformed the AdaBoost model (RMSE = 0.410; MSE = 0.168; MAE = 0.176). Our research has demonstrated the value of detailed mapping and subsequent yield prediction by developing a novel approach utilising time-series satellite imagery, ensemble machine learning, and NDVI, which will assist decision-makers in managing their practices related to oil palm. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AdaBoost; NDVI; oil palm yield forecasting; random forest (RF); walk-forward validation","algorithm; ensemble forecasting; Landsat; NDVI; prediction; remote sensing; time series analysis; vegetable oil","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (6300268-10801)","The researchers would like to acknowledge the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia for the resources and financial support through Long Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS)-Malaysia Research University Network (MRUN).

Big Data has become a significant factor that could be a material asset for both business and government organizations. As such, it is important to understand the definition of Big Data, their key characteristics, and the challenges surrounding the concept and characteristics. The implementation of Big Data brings new critical challenges that need to be addressed before starting the Big Data journey. The main challenges that are commonly faced by organizations are the implementation of Big Data alongside the critical challenges that involve the challenges related to technology, organization, process, data management, and skills. The challenges are difficult and the growth in terms of Big Data is increasing exponentially which calls for further investigation. This paper reviewed the existing literature on Big Data to achieve three objectives: first, to highlight the definitions and characteristics of Big Data and to summarize the most common definitions of existing works; second, to identify the impacts and the opportunities for the Big Data; third, to present and identify the main critical challenges related to Big Data and categorize these challenges as (People, Technology, Organization, Process, and Data management) challenges. © 2019 IEEE.","Big Data; Big Data Analytics; Big Data Challenges; Big Data Characteristics; Critical Success Factors; Data Management","Data Analytics; Information management; Business partners; Critical challenges; Critical success factor; Data challenges; Data characteristics; Data impact; Government organizations; Key characteristics; Big data","","","","","","","Manyika J., Et al., Big data: The next frontier for innovation , competition , and productivity, McKinsey Glob.

Data were retrospectively collected from women who came to the Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia for breast-related problems. Eight ML models were used: k-nearest neighbour (kNN), elastic-net logistic regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, artificial neural network, partial least square, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting. Features utilised for the development of the screening models were limited to information in the patient registration form. The final model was evaluated in terms of performance across a mammographic density. Additionally, the feature importance of the final model was assessed using the model agnostic approach. kNN had the highest Youden J index, precision, and PR-AUC, while SVM had the highest F2 score. The kNN model was selected as the final model. The model had a balanced performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and PR-AUC across the mammographic density groups. The most important feature was the age at examination. In conclusion, this study showed that ML and patient registration information are feasible to be used as the OTC screening model for breast cancer. © 2022 by the authors.","Asian women; breast cancer; clinical decision support systems; explainable artificial intelligence; machine learning; medical consultation delays; screening model","adult; Article; breast cancer; breast density; cancer classification; cancer patient; cancer risk; cancer screening; consultation; controlled study; feasibility study; female; human; k nearest neighbor; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; middle aged; multivariate analysis; partial least squares regression; patient registry; random forest; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; Youden index","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/SKK03/USM/02/1)","This research was funded by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia (FRGS/1/2019/SKK03/USM/02/1).","DeSantis C.E., Bray F., Ferlay J., Lortet-Tieulent J., Anderson B.O., Jemal A., International variation in female breast cancer incidence and mortality rates, Cancer Epidemiol.

Although numerous algorithms have been proposed for MSA, producing an efficient MSA with high accuracy remains a huge challenge. Progressive alignment method is broadly used for constructing MSA. It uses guide trees as an input to guide the alignment process. Pair-wise alignment plays a significant role in building the distance matrices where distance matrices are necessary for building the guide trees. Robust distance matrix leads to better MSA. In this research, we present Filtered Distance Matrix for building MSA (FDM-MSA) to construct MSA. FDM-MSA is divided into four phases: constructing the distance matrix, building the filtering system, building the guide tree, and constructing the MSA. HashTable-N-Gram-Hirschberg (HT-NGH) is used to build the distance matrix. Two sequence detectors are involved in building the filtering system: multi-domain detector and outlier detector. After filtering the distance matrix, Neighbor Joining and progressive alignment methods are employed to construct the guide tree and MSA. The experiments show that the FDM-MSA algorithm shows improved performance in both terms; time and accuracy. FDM-MSA algorithm obtains the best time performance over all competitive methods in most datasets, as well as obtains the highest Sum-of-Pairs Score on RV2 dataset of BAlibase dataset and the second best Total Column score on average. © 2005 - 2016 JATIT & LLS.

In an extensive study of empirical k-mer DNA on hundreds of organisms, the researchers found unique multi-modal k-mer spectra occur in the genomes of organisms from the tetrapod clade only which includes all mammals. The multi-modality is caused by the formation of the two lowest modes where k-mers under them are referred as the rare k-mers. The suppression of the two lowest modes (or the rare k-mers) can be attributed to the CG dinucleotide inclusions in them. Apart from that, the rare k-mers are selectively distributed in certain genomic features of CpG Island (CGI), promoter, 5' UTR, and exon. We correlated the rare k-mers with hundreds of annotated features using several bioinformatic tools, performed further intrinsic rare k-mer analyses within the correlated features, and modeled the elucidated rare k-mer clustering feature into a classifier to predict the correlated CGI and promoter features. Our correlation results show that rare k-mers are highly associated with several annotated features of CGI, promoter, 5' UTR, and open chromatin regions. Our intrinsic results show that rare k-mers have several unique topological, compositional, and clustering properties in CGI and promoter features. Finally, the performances of our RWC (rare-word clustering) method in predicting the CGI and promoter features are ranked among the top three, in eight of the CGI and promoter evaluations, among eight of the benchmarked datasets. © 2015.","CGI; Classification; Genome; K-tuple; N-mer; Rare-word","Animals; Birds; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21; Computational Biology; CpG Islands; Databases, Genetic; DNA; Fishes; Humans; Mammals; Nucleotide Motifs; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Mammalia; Tetrapoda; DNA; bioinformatics; DNA; empirical analysis; genome; animal; biology; bird; chemistry; chromosome 21; CpG island; fish; genetic database; genetics; human; mammal; nucleotide motif; promoter region","","DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA, ","","","Malaysian Genomics Resource Centre","We acknowledges and thankful for the guidance, financial supports, facilities, and technicalities provided by Malaysian Genomics Resource Centre (MGRC) Sdn.

Despite their ease of use, user authentication is an important factor that must be taken into consideration. In addition to the use of passwords, biometric data such as fingerprints or iris images can also be included as part of a multi-factor authentication system. However, these methods require secure storage of the biometric template and active participation from the user. In this paper, we propose a new method of authentication for identification cards based on colour visual cryptography and facial recognition. A colour image of the user will be encrypted using visual cryptography and split into two share images, one of which will be stored on the database and the other will be stored in the card. When the card is placed onto a sensor, the two shares will overlap to uncover the original image. The recovered image is then fed into a trained facial recognition algorithm to verify the user’s identity. The proposed method is evaluated based on recognition rate and runtime. Experimental results indicate the feasibility of the proposed method for practical application and can be used as a starting point for future work in the area. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Biometric template protection; Color visual cryptography; Facial recognition; Two-factor authentication methods; Visual cryptography","Authentication; Biometrics; Chromium compounds; Color; Cryptography; Digital storage; Electronic commerce; Biometric template protections; Electronic passports; Facial recognition; Identification cards; Multi-factor authentication; Public transportation; Two factor authentication; Visual cryptography; Face recognition","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61702212); Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315190)","This work has been partially supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant No. 304/PKOMP/6315190 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61702212.","Wagner M., 700+ attacks published on smart cards: The need for a systematic counter strategy, Constructive Side-Channel Analysis and Secure Design, pp. 33-38, (2012); Derbel A., Vivet D., Emile B., Access control based on gait analysis and face recognition, Electronics Letters, 51, 10, pp. 751-752, (2012); Ross A., Othman A., Visual cryptography for biometric privacy, IEEE Trans on Information Forensics and Security, 6, 1, pp. 70-81, (2011); Varpe S., Irabashetti P., Visual Cryptography for Providing Privacy to Biometric Data, (2016); Naor M., Shamir A., Visual cryptography, Advances in Cryptology: Eurocrypt, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 950, (1994); Hou Y.-C., Visual cryptography for colour images, Pattern Recognition, 36, 7, pp. 1619-1629, (2003); James D., Philip M., A novel security architecture for biometric templates using visual cryptography and chaotic image encryption, Eco-Friendly Computing and Communication Systems, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 305, (2012); Kaur H., Khanna P., Biometric template protection using cancelable biometrics and visual cryptography techniques, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 75, 23, pp. 16333-16361, (2016); Yang W., Hu J., Wang S., Chen C., Mutual dependency of features in multimodal biometric systems, Electronics Letters, 51, 3, pp. 234-235, (2015); Judith I.D., Mary G.J., Susanna M.M., Three factor biometric authentication for spiraling of security, Emerging Trends in Engineering, Technology and Science (ICETETS), International Conference on, pp. 1-3, (2016); Abdul W., Ali Z., Ghouzali S., Alfawaz B., Muhammad G., Hossain M.S., Biometric security through visual encryption for fog edge computing, IEEE Access, 5, pp. 5531-5538, (2017); Venukumar V., Pathari V., Multi-factor authentication using threshold cryptography, Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI), 2016 International Conference on, pp. 1694-1698, (2016); Turk M.A., Pentland A.P., Face recognition using eigenfaces, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 586-659, (1991); Ito R., Kuwakodo H., Tanaka H., Image size invariant cryptography, IEICE Trans Fundamentals, E82-A, 10, pp. 2172-2177, (2012); Yang C.-N., Chen Y.-S., Colored visual cryptography scheme based on additive color mixing, Pattern Recognition, 41, 10, pp. 3114-3129, (2008); The AR Face Database, (1998)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","3rd International Conference on Cryptography, Security and Privacy, ICCSP 2019 with Workshop 2019 the 4th International Conference on Multimedia and Image Processing, ICMIP 2019","19 January 2019 through 21 January 2019","Kuala Lumpur","147274","","978-145036618-2","","","English","ACM Int.

Many ICMPv6-DDoS attack detection mechanisms rely on self-created datasets because very few suitable ICMPv6-DDoS attack datasets are publicly available due to privacy and security concerns. When implemented in a real network, however, a detection system that relies on a dataset with incorrect packet or flow representation and contains unqualified features generates a large number of false alerts. The goal of this work is to create a comprehensive ICMPv6-DDoS attack dataset that can be used for tuning, benchmarking, and evaluating any detection systems designed to detect ICMPv6-DDoS attacks. The proposed datasets met the criteria for a good dataset, ensuring their usefulness to other researchers. A GNS3 network simulation tool is used to simulate an IPv6 network and generate ICMPv6 traffic for the dataset. The generated traffic contains both normal and abnormal ICMPv6 traffic, with the abnormal traffic containing ten different ICMPv6-DDoS attacks based on RA and NS message flooding. Five classifiers were chosen, varying in terms of type, classification performance, and the number of features used, and the results were as follows: decision tree 80%, support vector machine 78%, naïve Bayes 80%, k-nearest neighbours 81%, and neural networks 81%.

Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) uses Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) for assigning the IPv6 address to hosts and provides the host with network configuration parameters. The DHCPv6 protocol may use to reveal host information and inject fake information into a host. Thus, the authentication and privacy of the DHCPv6 messages are a vital security component in the IPv6 network. This paper proposes a new security approach to provide privacy and security for the DHCPv6 message. The proposed approach utilized a hybrid cryptosystem and Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm to provide privacy and authentication.

Public databases containing information on biological processes for hundreds of organisms are assisting in the inference of such networks. This paper proposes a multiobjective genetic algorithm method to reconstruct networks related to metabolism and protein interaction. Such a method utilizes structural properties of scale-free networks and known biological information about individual genes and proteins to reconstruct metabolic networks represented as enzyme graph and protein interaction networks. We test our method on four commonly-used protein networks in yeast. Two are networks related to the metabolism of the yeast: KEGG and BioCyc. The other two datasets are networks from protein-protein interaction: Krogan and BioGrid. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of reconstructing biological networks by combining different omics data and structural characteristics of scale-free networks. However, the proposed method to reconstruct the network is time-consuming because several evaluations must be performed. We parallelized this method on GPU to overcome this limitation by parallelizing the objective functions of the presented method. The parallel method shows a significant reduction in the execution time over the GPU card which yields a 492-fold speedup. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biological network reconstruction; Metaheuristic; Optimization; Topological properties","Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Models, Statistical; Protein Interaction Maps; Systems Biology; protein; algorithm; biological analysis; database; metabolism; optimization; protein; reconstruction; topology; algorithm; Article; controlled study; evaluation study; gene expression; genetic algorithm; gold standard; nonhuman; population size; protein localization; protein metabolism; protein protein interaction; reduction (chemistry); Saccharomyces cerevisiae; algorithm; factual database; gene regulatory network; human; metabolism; protein analysis; statistical model; systems biology","","protein, 67254-75-5","","","","","Alstott J., Bullmore E., Plenz D., Powerlaw: a python package for analysis of heavy-tailed distributions, PLOS ONE, 9, 1, (2014); Bailey A., Ventresca M., Ombuki-Berman B., Genetic programming for the automatic inference of graph models for complex networks, IEEE Trans.

Predicting yields on a large scale in a timely and accurate manner by considering these factors is essential for preventing climate risk and ensuring food security, particularly in the light of climate change and the escalation of extreme climatic events. In this study, integrating multi-source data (i.e. satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs), satellite-derived climatic variables (i.e. land surface temperature (LST) and rainfall precipitation, weather station and field-surveys), we built one multiple linear regression (MLR), three machine learning (XGBoost, support vector regression, and random forest) and one deep learning (deep neural network) models to predict oil palm yield at block-level within the oil palm plantation. Moreover, time-series moving average and backward elimination feature selection technique were implemented at the pre-processing stage. The yield prediction models were developed and tested using MLR, XGBoost, support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF) and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms. Their model performances were then compared using evaluation metrics and generated the final spatial prediction map based on the best performance. DNN achieved the best model performances for both selected (R2 = 0.91; RMSE = 2.92 t ha− 1; MAE = 2.56 t ha− 1 and MAPE = 0.09 t ha− 1) and full predictors (R2 = 0.76; RMSE of 3.03 t ha− 1; MAE of 2.88 t ha− 1; MAPE of 0.10 t ha− 1). In addition, advanced ensemble machine learning (ML) techniques such as XGBoost may be utilised as a supplementary for oil palm yield prediction at the block level. Among them, MLR recorded the lowest performance. By using backward elimination to identify the most significant predictors, the performance of all models was improved by 5–26% for R2, and that decreased by 3–31% for RMSE, 7–34% for MAE, and 1–15% for MAPE. After backward elimination, the DNN achieved the highest prediction accuracy among the other models, with a 14% increase in R-squared, a 11% decrease in RMSE, a 32% decrease in MAE and a 1% decrease in MAPE. Our study successfully developed efficient and accurate yield prediction models for timely predicting oil palm yield over a large area by integrating data from multiple sources. These would be useful for plantation management estimating oil palm yields to speed up the decision-making process for sustainable production. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Machine learning; Multi-source data; Oil palm yields","crop yield; extreme event; food security; machine learning; oil industry","","","","","Malaysian Research University Network, (6300268-10801); Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Funding text 1: We wish to express our gratitude to the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia for funding through the Long-Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS) of the Malaysian Research University Network (MRUN).

A new protocol, IP version 6 (IPv6) was developed in 1998 in anticipation of such situation as well as to improve network communications in general. IPv6 offers improvements in several areas over IPv4 such as security by including a built-in security mechanism, IPsec. In addition, it also introduced new functionalities such as neighbor discovery which were specified in Neighbor Discovery protocol (NDP). NDP is a core protocol in IPv6 network for link local communication. Unfortunately, IPsec is not usable with NDP due to bootstrapping problem resulting in IPv6 local communication to be left unsecured and IPv6 nodes vulnerable to insider attacks. There are many mechanisms proposed to protect IPv6 network from NDP-related attacks. This paper reviewed existing preventive mechanisms against NDP-based attacks in IPv6 network. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","ICMPv6 protocol messages; IPsec; IPv6 network security;

In an ASN P system with spiking rules of categories (a, ā) and (a, ā) without forgetting rules, the neurons change spikes to anti-spikes or change anti-spikes to spikes; such systems are proved to be universal.

Most Internet connections nowadays are accessed using mobile devices in order to stay connected all the time and everywhere. Owing to the limited coverage of such access points as well as base stations, mobile devices are required to handover connectivity if there is a move to other locations. Horizontal handover is conducted when the movement is within the same network. Otherwise, there must be vertical handover when external network infrastructure is encountered. However, as the Internet is an open network that naturally lacks trust between users, the mobile nodes that move to an external network are susceptible to various attacking activities. Compromising mobile nodes may cause users to lose their data as well as destroy their mobile devices in terms of both software and hardware. Securing mobile devices is crucial in order to avoid losses in terms of not only money but also facilities. Although mobile nodes have been developed with certain security features, some researchers have found vulnerabilities. This paper surveys in detail the security vulnerabilities of mobile IPv6 vertical handover and the current relevant mitigation methods. Furthermore, we describe the mechanism of mobile IPv6 vertical handover and its security vulnerability as well as security mechanisms proposed by researchers. Based on the survey, there are apparently weaknesses in current security features that are in need of solutions to minimize the effect of malicious activities. An open direction of future research on mobile IPv6 vertical handover security is elaborated at the end of this paper. © 2020 Supriyanto Praptodiyono et al.","","Internet protocols; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems;

This empirical study aims to assess the interaction between human and iHeart. In line with this, a survey was conducted among healthcare professional in two cities of Isfahan and Penang to find how intention to “Use” of iHeart and “User satisfaction” conveys the role of effective factors [Information Quality (IQ), Service Quality (SQ), System Quality (SysQ), Trust (Tr), Anxiety (Ax), and mHealth Literacy (mHL)] to the “Success of Human Interaction (SHI)” with iHeart. The total number of 323 respondents returned the questionnaire. Using DeLone and McLean IS success model, a conceptual model was developed to identify the mediating effects of “Use” and “User satisfaction”. Covariance-based structural equation modelling was applied for data analysis using the statistical software AMOS. In this study, mediation effect was examined in three different methods including Baron and Kenny, Sobel test, and Bootstrapping technique. The most reliable results are from bootstrapping technique, which indicate that “Use” mediates the effects of SysQ, Tr, and mHL on SHI. In addition, “User satisfaction” is a mediator between SysQ, SQ, and mHL with SHI. Ultimately, IQ has direct effect on SHI without involvement of mediator. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Assessment; Human–computer interaction; Medical information system; mHealth; Success; Use; User satisfaction","Bioinformatics; Human computer interaction; Information analysis; Information use; mHealth; Statistical methods; Surveys; Assessment; Computer interaction; Health care professionals; Information quality; Statistical software; Structural equation modelling; Success; User satisfaction; Medical information systems","","","","","National Advanced IPv6 Centre of Excellence, (Nav6); Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors are grateful to School of Computer Sciences and Institute of Postgraduate Studies, Universiti Sains Malaysia for the prestigious USM Fellowship Scheme granted to Pantea Keikhosrokiani to pursue her Doctoral studies in Service System Engineering.

There are many algorithms developed to solve MSA, but an efficient computation method with very high accuracy is still a challenge. Progressive alignment is the most widely used approach to compute the final MSA. In this paper, we present a simple and effective progressive approach. Based on the independent order of sequences progressive alignment which proposed in QOMA, this method has been modified to align the whole sequences to maximize the score of MSA. Moreover, in order to further improve the accuracy of the method, we estimate the similarity of any pair of input sequences by using their percent identity, and based on this measure, we choose different substitution matrices during the progressive alignment. In addition, we have included horizontal information to alignment by adjusting the weights of amino acid residues based on their neighboring residues. The experimental results have been tested on popular benchmark of global protein sequences BAliBASE 3.0 and local protein sequences IRMBASE 2.0. The results of the proposed approach outperform the original method in QOMA in terms of sum-of-pair score and column score by up to 14% and 7% respectively. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.","Multiple sequence alignments; Progressive; Protein sequences","","","","","","","","Notredame C., Pharmacogenomics, 3, (2002); Kemena C., Notredame C., Bioinformatics, 25, (2009); Thompson J.D., Plewniak F., Poch O., (1999); Naznin, Sarker R., Essam D., Evol.

There are five principal variants related to CD: incremental, gradual, recurrent, sudden, and blip. Genetic programming combiner (GPC) classification is an effective core candidate for data stream classification for IDS. However, its basic structure relies on the usage of traditional static machine learning models that receive onetime training, limiting its ability to handle CD. To address this issue, we propose an extended variant of the GPC using three main components. First, we replace existing classifiers with alternatives: online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM), feature adaptive OSELM (FA-OSELM), and knowledge preservation OSELM (KP-OSELM). Second, we add two new components to the GPC, specifically, a data balancing and a classifier update. Third, the coordination between the sub-models produces three novel variants of the GPC: GPC-KOS for KA-OSELM; GPC-FOS for FA-OSELM; and GPC-OS for OSELM. This article presents the first data stream-based classification framework that provides novel strategies for handling CD variants. The experimental results demonstrate that both GPC-KOS and GPC-FOS outperform the traditional GPC and other state-of-the-art methods, and the transfer learning and memory features contribute to the effective handling of most types of CD. Moreover, the application of our incremental variants on real-world datasets (KDD Cup ‘99, CICIDS-2017, CSE-CIC-IDS-2018, and ISCX ‘12) demonstrate improved performance (GPC-FOS in connection with CSE-CIC-IDS-2018 and CICIDS-2017; GPC-KOS in connection with ISCX2012 and KDD Cup ‘99), with maximum accuracy rates of 100% and 98% by GPC-KOS and GPC-FOS, respectively. Additionally, our GPC variants do not show superior performance in handling blip drift. © 2023 by the authors.","concept drift; genetic programming combiner; incremental learning; intrusion detection; stream data classification; transfer learning","Balancing; Classification (of information); Genetic algorithms; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Concept drifts; Data stream classifications; Genetic programming combiner; Incremental learning; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Online sequential extreme learning machine; Performance; Stream data classifications; Transfer learning; article; classifier; data classification; learning; machine learning; memory; transfer of learning; Genetic programming","","","","","","","Yazdi H.S., Bafghi A.G., A drift aware adaptive method based on minimum uncertainty for anomaly detection in social networking, Expert Syst.

This study discussed the oil palm mapping using satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) and classification of land cover features using machine learning algorithms such as linear support vector classifier (LSVC), random forests (RF) and deep neural network (DNN). A total 13218 sampling points (80% of the total sampling points used as training samples and 20% applied as testing samples) were randomly selected in the study area which were then classified into six land cover features; water, bare soil, forest, immature oil palm (the age of 2-8 year), mature oil palm (age >8 year) and built-up area. These data were validated by using spectral reflectance, Google Earth Pro and ground checking. The accuracy assessment was conducted by a confusion matrix method. The results showed that classification of land features using DNN with batch size 32 and epoch 100 has the highest accuracy which is 99.35% for overall accuracy and 98.49% kappa accuracy. This study demonstrated various machine learning algorithms that may be used to detect and classify the maturity of oil palm trees, which is vital to record in tree inventories for effective plantation management.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","The researchers would like to acknowledge the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia for the resources and financial support through Long Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS)-Malaysia Research University Network (MRUN).

SI algorithms have demonstrated their efficacy in solving various types of real-world optimization problems. However, it is impossible to find an optimization algorithm that can obtain the global optimum for every optimization problem. Therefore, researchers extensively try to improve methods of solving complex optimization problems. Many SI search algorithms are widely applied to solve such problems. ABC is one of the most popular algorithms in solving different kinds of optimization problems. However, it has a weak local search performance where the equation of solution search in ABC performs good exploration, but poor exploitation. Besides, it has a fast convergence and can therefore be trapped in the local optima for some complex multimodal problems. In order to address such issues, this paper proposes a novel hybrid ABC with outstanding local search algorithm called β-hill climbing (βHC) and denoted by ABC–βHC. The aim is to improve the exploitation mechanism of the standard ABC. The proposed algorithm was experimentally tested with parameters tuning process and validated using selected benchmark functions with different characteristics, and it was also evaluated and compared with well-known state-of-the-art algorithms. The evaluation process was investigated using different common measurement metrics. The result showed that the proposed ABC–βHC had faster convergence in most benchmark functions and outperformed eight algorithms including the original ABC in terms of all the selected measurement metrics. For more validation, Wilcoxon’s rank sum statistical test was conducted, and the p values were found to be mostly less than 0.05, which demonstrates that the superiority of the proposed ABC–βHC is statistically significant. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial bee colony algorithm; Metaheuristic optimization algorithms; Numerical benchmark function optimization; Swarm intelligence algorithms; β-Hill climbing","Learning algorithms; Swarm intelligence; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Hill climbing; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Numerical benchmark; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Local search (optimization)","","","","","Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, UTeM, (zamalah scheme)","","Jarrah M.I.M., Hybrid Artificial Bees Colony Algorithms for Optimizing Carbon Nanotubes Characteristics, (2018); Jamil M., Yang X.S., A literature survey of benchmark functions for global optimization problems, Int J Math Model Numer Optim, 4, 2, pp. 150-194, (2013); Charalampakis A.E., Chatzigiannelis I., Analytical solutions for the minimum weight design of trusses by cylindrical algebraic decomposition, Arch Appl Mech, 88, 1-2, pp. 39-49, (2018); Zavala G.R., Nebro A.J., Luna F., Coello C.A., A survey of multi-objective metaheuristics applied to structural optimization, Struct Multidiscip Optim, 49, 4, pp. 537-558, (2014); Jarrah M.I., Jaya A.S.M., Muhamad M.R., Abd Rahman M.N., Basari A.S.H., Modeling and optimization of physical vapour deposition coating process parameters for tin grain size using combined genetic algorithms with response surface methodology, J Theor Appl Inf Technol, 77, 2, pp. 235-252, (2015); Jarrah M.I., Jaya A.S.M., Azam M.A., Alsharif M.H., Muhamad M.R., Intelligence integration of particle swarm optimization and physical vapour deposition for tin grain size coating process parameters, J Theor Appl Inf Technol, 84, 3, (2016); Al Nuaimi Z.N.A.M., Abdullah R., Neural network training using hybrid particle-move artificial bee colony algorithm for pattern classification, J ICT, 2, 2, pp. 314-334, (2017); Alomari O.A., Khader T.A., Azmi A.M., Awadallah M.A., A novel gene selection method using modified MRMR and hybrid bat-inspired algorithm with β-hill climbing, Appl Intell, (2018); Shehab M., Tajudin A., Makhlouf K., Alomari O.A., Hybridizing cuckoo search algorithm with bat algorithm for global numerical optimization, J Supercomput, 75, 5, pp. 2395-2422, (2018); Zarrabi A., Samsudin K., Karuppiah E.K., Gravitational search algorithm using CUDA: a case study in high-performance metaheuristics, J Supercomput, 71, 4, pp. 1277-1296, (2015); Karaboga D., An idea based on honey bee swarm for numerical optimization, Technical Report TR06, Erciyes Univ (TR06), 10, (2005); Kennedy J., Eberhart R., Particle swarm optimization, Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 1942-1948, (1995); Li X., Shao Z., Qian J., An optimizing method based on autonomous animats: fish-swarm algorithm, Syst Eng Theory Pract, 22, 11, pp. 32-38, (2002); Yang X.S., A new metaheuristic bat-inspired algorithm, Nature Inspired Cooperative Strategies for Optimization (NISCO 2010).

Two well-known issues of DHCPv6 are privacy concerns due to lack of protection of client information in transit, and lack of verification mechanism that allows attackers to inject fake network configuration parameters into the network undetected. This paper proposes DHCPv6 security (DHCPv6Sec) approach that is based on a hybrid cryptosystem to provide authentication for the DHCPv6 server messages and to protect the privacy of the DHCPv6 client. The DHCPv6Sec was evaluated and compared to the Secure-DHCPv6 in terms of processing time, traffic overhead, rogue DHCPv6 server prevention, privacy protection, and DHCPv6 message size limitation. The experiment results show that the DHCPv6Sec has 52% less processing time; 74% less traffic overhead; and remarkable superiority in all aspects measured. © 2013 IEEE.","DHCPv6; DHCPv6 server; IPv6 network; IPv6 privacy; rogue DHCPv6 server attack","Authentication; DHCPv6; Dynamic host configuration protocols; Hybrid cryptosystem; IPv6 networks; Network configuration; Privacy concerns; Privacy protection; Server attacks; Internet protocols","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PNAV/6316271)","This work was supported in part by the Bridging Research Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), under Grant 304/PNAV/6316271.","Groat S., Dunlop M., Urbanksi W., Marchany R., Tront J., Using an IPv6 moving target defense to protect the smart grid, Proc.

Also, a quantum Grover attack is modeled on the proposed quantum SAES. First, quantum circuits for the main components of S-AES in the finite field 2[x]/(x4 + x + 1), are constructed. Then, the constructed circuits are put together to form a quantum version of S-AES. A C-NOT synthesis is used to decompose some of the functions to reduce the number of the needed qubits. The quantum S-AES is integrated into a black-box queried by Grover’s algorithm. A new approach is proposed to uniquely recover the secret key when Grover attack is applied. The entire work is simulated and tested on a quantum mechanics simulator. The complexity analysis shows that a block cipher can be designed as a quantum circuit with a polynomial cost. In addition, the secret key is recovered in quadratic speedup as promised by Grover’s algorithm. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Block cipher; Grover attack; Quantum cryptanalysis; Quantum simulation; Symmetric cryptography","Application programs; Data privacy; Quantum chemistry; Quantum optics; Block ciphers; Grover attack; Quantum cryptanalysis; Quantum simulations; Symmetric cryptography; Cryptography","","","","","","","Rivest R.L., Shamir A., Adleman L., A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-key Cryptosystems, Commun.

Consumers of such services are sharing their genetic and clinical information with the research community to facilitate the extraction of knowledge about different conditions. In this paper, we build on these services to analyse the genetic data of people with different BMI levels to determine the immediate and long-term risk factors associated with obesity. Using web scraping techniques, a dataset containing publicly available information about 230 participants from the Personal Genome Project is created. Subsequent analysis of the dataset is conducted for the identification of genetic variants associated with high BMI levels via standard quality control and association analysis protocols for Genome Wide Association Analysis. We applied a combination of Random Forest based feature selection algorithm and Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function Kernel learning method to the filtered dataset. Using a robust data science methodology our approach identified obesity related genetic variants, to be used as features when predicting individual obesity susceptibility. The results reveal that the subset of features obtained through the Random Forest based algorithm improve the performance of the classifier when compared to the top statistically significant genetic variants identified in logistic regression. Support Vector Machine showed the best results with sensitivity=81%, specificity=83% and area under the curve=92% when the model was trained with the top fifteen features selected by Boruta. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Bioinformatics; Data science; Feature selection; Genetics; Machine learning; Obesity; SNPs","Bioinformatics; Classification (of information); Computation theory; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Genes; Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Nutrition; Radial basis function networks; Support vector machines; Classification methods; Data science; Feature selection algorithm; Genetics; Genome-wide association; Obesity; Radial basis function kernels; SNPs; Quality control","","","","","","","James W.P.T., WHO recognition of the global obesity epidemic, Int.

IPv6 has introduced new features like Neighbour Discovery Protocol (NDP) and Address Auto-configuration Scheme. IPv6 needed several protocols like the Address Auto-configuration Scheme and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6). IPv6 is vulnerable to numerous attacks like Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) which is one of the most dangerous attacks executed through ICMPv6 messages that impose security and financial implications. Therefore, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a monitoring system of the security of a network that detects suspicious activities and deals with a massive amount of data comprised of repetitive and inappropriate features which affect the detection rate. A feature selection (FS) technique helps to reduce the computation time and complexity by selecting the optimum subset of features. This paper proposes a method for detecting DDoS flooding attacks (FA) based on ICMPv6 messages using a Binary Flower Pollination Algorithm (BFPA-FA). The proposed method (BFPA-FA) employs FS technology with a support vector machine (SVM) to identify the most relevant, influential features. Moreover, The ICMPv6-DDoS dataset was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through different attack scenarios. The results show that the proposed method BFPA-FA achieved the best accuracy rate (97.96%) for the ICMPv6 DDoS detection with a reduced number of features (9) to half the total (19) features. The proven proposed method BFPA-FA is effective in the ICMPv6 DDoS attacks via IDS. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

By optimizing the training of the neural networks using optimal weight set, better results can be obtained by the neural networks. Traditional neural networks algorithms such as Back Propagation (BP) were used for ANNT, but they have some drawbacks such as computational complexity and getting trapped in the local minima. Therefore, evolutionary algorithms like the Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms have been employed in ANNT to overcome such issues. Artificial Bees Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm is one of the competitive algorithms in the SI algorithms group. However, hybrid algorithms are also a fundamental concern in the optimization field, which aim to cumulate the advantages of different algorithms into one algorithm. In this work, we aimed to highlight the performance of the Hybrid Particle-move Artificial Bee Colony (HPABC) algorithm by applying it on the ANNT application. The performance of the HPABC algorithm was investigated on four benchmark pattern-classification datasets and the results were compared with other algorithms. The results obtained illustrate that HPABC algorithm can efficiently be used for ANNT. HPABC outperformed the original ABC and PSO as well as other state-of-art and hybrid algorithms in terms of time, function evaluation number and recognition accuracy.","Artificial Bee Colony algorithm;

Artificial Bees Colony (ABC) Optimization algorithm, inspired from the honey bees' food foraging behavior, is an optimization method used for bioinformatics problems where the Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) is considered as one of these problems. For a given protein, knowing the exact action whether hormonal, enzymatic, transmembranal or nuclear receptors, etc does not depend solely on amino acid sequence but on the way the amino acid thread folds as well. This paper presents a modified ABC algorithm, where a crossover operator from the Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been added to the original ABC algorithm. To solve the PSP problem, a conformation with the lowest free energy is the target of the ABC search. The results show the ability of the modified ABC to reach the global minima for PSP problem by using around quarter of the iterations that the classical ABC needs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Artificial Bees Colony; Genetic Algorithm; Prediction; Protein structure","Algorithms; Amino acids; Bioinformatics; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Intelligent systems; Proteins; Soft computing; Amino acid sequence; Artificial bee colony optimization algorithms; Artificial bees; Foraging behaviors; Optimization algorithms; Optimization method; Protein structure prediction; Protein structures; Problem solving","","","","","","","Das S., Abraham A., Konar A., Swarm intelligence algorithms in bioinformatics, Swarm Intelligence Algorithms In Bioinformatics.

The severity of network worms depends on the propagation process that degrades the network performance and consume bandwidth and resource (CPU and memory). Thus, this paper presents a behavioral approach for UDP worm (worm uses UDP as transmission mechanism) detection based on scanning and Destination Source Correlation (DSC) behaviors of worm. The proposed approach consists of two sub approaches which are: 1. Statistical Cross-relation Approach for Network Scanning detection (SCANS) approach that is used to detect the presence of network scanning behavior of worm and 2. Worm correlation approach that is used to detect Destination-Source Correlation (DSC) behavior of worm. These behaviors have been chosen among other worm behaviors due to its anomaly behaviors that are clearly exhibit in the network. A salient feature of this approach is that it effective for detecting scanning DSC behaviors of worm with high accuracy. The proposed approach is evaluated with the simulated dataset obtained from Georgia Tech Network Simulator (GTNetS) simulator and confirmed that our approach is efficient in detecting UDP worm than the existing approach.","Behavioural based approach; UDP worm; UDP worm detection","","","","","","","","Yini W., Sheng W., Yang X., Wanlei Z., Modeling the propagation of worms in networks: A survey, Communications Surveys and Tutorials., IEEE., 16, 2, pp. 942-960, (2014); Yang W., Gao Y.P., Zhu Z.I., Chang G.R., Yao Y., Modelling, analysis and containment of passive worms in P2P networks, Int J Internet Protoc Technol, 8, 2-3, pp. 130-142, (2014); Stafford S., Li J., Behavior-based worm detectors compared, 6307, pp. 38-57, (2010); Strayer W.T., Lapsely D., Walsh R., Livadas C., Botnet detection based on network behavior, Botnet Detection.

Yet, the acceptance of health information systems (HIS) is still low in the developed, and the medical infrastructure in developing countries must be evaluated for the implementation of these new technologies. Two versions of information system (IS) Success Models in 1992 and 2004 are the most prominent theories to evaluate effectiveness of IS over time. As these theories are generic, more investigation is necessary in order to identify the possible antecedents that might predict acceptance and usage of HIS among healthcare providers. Moreover, due to technological changes from advancement of electronic medical records (EMR) to electronic health records (EHR) as the core components of HIS, the previous system characteristics, use, and conceivable impacts should be expanded to include new components. This paper attempts to explore new technological factors that could influence use of EHR systems and finally reflect on the effectiveness of these systems in major healthcare frameworks. Accordingly, an extended theoretical framework is proposed to offer new avenues for future research in order to be tested qualitatively or quantitatively.","Electronic health records; Health information systems; System effectiveness; Technological factors","Developing countries; Health; Health care; Information management; Information systems; Medical computing; Records management; Electronic health record; Electronic medical record; Health information systems; Healthcare institutions; Information system success model; System characteristics; System effectiveness; Technological factors; Medical information systems","","","","","","","Ghani A., Bali M.K., Naguib R.N.R.K., Marshall I.M., Electronic health records approaches and challenges: A comparison between malaysia and four east asian countries, International Journal of Electronic Healthcare, 4, 1, pp. 78-104, (2008); Abdullah Z.S., Hospital Information Systems Implementation Framework: Critical Success Factors for Malaysian Public Hospitals, (2013); Ammenwerth E., Brender J., Nykanen P., Prokosch H.U., Rigby M., Talmon J., Visions and strategies to improve evaluation of health information systems; Reflections and lessons based on the his-eval workshop in innsbruck, Int.

They have several negative economic impacts as well. Such impacts are affecting organizations and individuals. Recent botnets–such as Zeus and Citadel’s Conficker–use the Domain Name System (DNS) to avoid detection. These botnets use the DNS server to prevent the network administrator from locating and shutting down the C&C servers. Therefore, this paper proposes a DNS rule-based approach for Botnet Detection (DNS-BD) that can improve the accuracy of DNS traffic-based detection of botnets. This approach is based on DNS query and response behaviours; it aims to detect any abnormal DNS query and response behaviours by applying the proposed DNS query and response rules. The result showed that the proposed approach can detect the botnet with an accuracy of 99.35% and a false-positive rate of 0.25%. A comparison with well-known DNS-based approaches evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It has been concluded that the approach proposed outperforms other approaches that can be implemented as part of any anti-viruses IDS product. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Botnet detection; DNS; Network security; Rule-based","Botnet; Computer viruses; Network security; Viruses; Botnet detections; Domain name system; Economic impacts; False positive rates; Network administrator; Response behaviour; Rule based; Rule-based approach; Internet protocols","","","","","Al-Balqa' Applied University, BAU, (DSR-2018)","This work was supported by the Al-Balqa Applied University, Jordan Grant Number: [DSR-2018-#4.].","Abdullah R.S., Mf A., Za N., Mas' Ud M.Z., Sr S., Yusof R., Revealing the Criterion on Botnet Detection Technique, IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 10, 2, pp. 208-215, (2013); Abu Rajab M., Zarfoss J., Monrose F., Terzis A., A Multifaceted Approach to Understanding the Botnet Phenomenon, Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement, pp. 41-52, (2006); Aiello M., Mongelli M., Papaleo G., DNS Tunneling Detection through Statistical Fingerprints of Protocol Messages and Machine Learning, International Journal of Communication Systems, (2014); Aiello M., Mongelli M., Papaleo G., Supervised Learning Approaches with Majority Voting for DNS Tunneling Detection, International Joint Conference SOCO’14-CISIS’14-ICEUTE’14, Bilbao, Spain, pp. 463-472, (2014); Alieyan K., Anbar M., Almomani A., Abdullah R., Alauthman M., Botnets Detecting Attack Based on DNS Features, 2018 International Arab Conference on Information Technology (ACIT), Werdanye, Lebanon, (2018); Alkasassbeh M., An Empirical Evaluation for the Intrusion Detection Features Based on Machine Learning and Feature Selection Methods, arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.09623, (2017); Almomani A., Fast-flux Hunter: A System for Filtering Online Fast-flux Botnet, Neural Computing and Applications, 29, 7, pp. 483-493, (2018); Almomani A., Obeidat A., Alsaedi K., Obaida M.A.H., Al-Betar M., Spam E-mail Filtering Using ECOS Algorithms, Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8, S9, pp. 260-272, (2015); Almomani A., Alauthman M., Omar A., Firas A., A Proposed Framework for Botnet Spam-email Filtering Using Neucube, Presented at the The International Arab Conference on Information Technology, (2017); Almomani A., Alauthman M., Albalas F., Dorgham O., Obeidat A., An Online Intrusion Detection System to Cloud Computing Based on Neucube Algorithms, International Journal of Cloud Applications and Computing (IJCAC), 8, 2, pp. 96-112, (2018); Al-Nawasrah A., Al-Momani A., Meziane F., Alauthman M., Fast Flux Botnet Detection Framework Using Adaptive Dynamic Evolving Spiking Neural Network Algorithm, Proceedings, the 9th International Conference on Information and Communication Systems (ICICS 2018), (2018); Altaher A., Ramadass S., Meulenberg A., Abdat M., Ali A., Combined Behavior-and Signature-Based Internet Worm Detection System, International Information Institute (Tokyo).

The new parallel granularity, which has the same granularity level as the parallel slice-level H.264 codec, is based on decomposing the entire video frame into tiles by utilizing a new inherently parallel 2D domain decomposition method. To assess the proposed approach, its parallel scalability, bit rate, and parallel impact on visual quality (peak signal-to-noise ratio) are compared with those of other approaches. Empirical results show significant improvements in encoding time as compared to the serial and the parallel slice-level approaches. In terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and bit rate, certain results improved, a few were comparable, while a few were discouraging, when compared to the results of the other approaches. However, addressing the limitations of the proposed method is highlighted as future work.","2D domain decomposition method; OpenMP; Parallel impact; Parallel scalability; Speed-up; Video bit rate; Video compression efficiency","","","","","","","","Zhao Y.H., Yin R.N., A system design of H.264 HD encoding used in broadcast television systems, International Conference on System Science, Engineering Design and Manufacturing Informatization (ICSEM), pp. 152-155, (2011); Ostermann J., Et al., Video coding with H.264/AVC: tools, performance, and complexity, IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine, pp. 7-28, (2004); Jo S., Et al., Exploring parallelization techniques based on OpenMP in H.264/AVC encoder for embedded multi-core processor, Journal of Systems Architecture, 58, pp. 339-353, (2012); Franche J.F., Coulombe S., A multi-frame and multi-slice H.264 parallel video encoding approach with simultaneous encoding of prediction frames, 2012 2nd International Conference on Consumer Electronics, Communications and Networks (CECNet), pp. 3034-3038, (2012); Tu T.H., Et al., Batch-pipelining for multicore H.264 decoding, Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, 23, pp. 742-752, (2012); Saponara S., Et al., Performance and complexity co-evaluation of the advanced video coding standard for costeffective multimedia communications, EURASIP J.

The uniqueness of this study relies on the ability of the proteomic patterns to detect particular disease especially at the early stage. However, identification through high-throughput mass spectrometry analysis raises some challenges. Typically, it suffers from high dimensionality of data with tens of thousands attributes and high level of redundancy and noises. Hence this study will focus on two stages of mass spectrometry pipelines; firstly we propose shrinkage estimation of covariance to evaluate the discriminant characteristics among peaks of mass spectrometry data for feature extraction; secondly a sophisticated computational technique that mimic survival and natural processing which is called as Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) as feature selection is integrated with linear SVM classifier for this biomarker discovery analysis. The proposed method is tested with real-world ovarian cancer dataset to evaluate the discrimination power, accuracy, sensitivity and also specificity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","bio-inspired algorithm; classification; feature extraction; feature selection; metaheuristic; swarm algorithm","Algorithms; Classification (of information); Data processing; Diseases; Feature extraction; Intelligent systems; Mass spectrometry; Shrinkage; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Bio-inspired algorithms; Computational technique; Mass spectrometry analysis; Mass spectrometry data; Metaheuristic; Shrinkage estimations; Swarm algorithms; Biomarkers","","","","","","","Armananzas R., Saeys Y., Inza I., Garcia-Torres M., Bielza C., Van De Peer Y., Larranaga P., Peakbin selection in mass spectrometry data using a consensus approach with estimation of distribution algorithms, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, 8, 3, pp. 760-774, (2011); Celik M., Karaboga D., Koylu F., Artificial Bee Colony Data Miner (Abc-miner), pp. 96-100, (2011); Celis J.E., Gromov P., Proteomics in translational cancer research: Toward an integrated approach, Cancer Cell, 3, 1, pp. 9-15, (2003); Coombes K.R., Tsavachidis S., Morris J.S., Baggerly K.A., Hung M.C., Kuerer H.M., Improved peak detection and quantification of mass spectrometry data acquired from surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization by denoising spectra with the undecimated discrete wavelet transform, Proteomics, 5, 16, pp. 4107-4117, (2005); Efron B., Morris C., Data analysis using stein's estimator and its generalizations, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 70, 350, pp. 311-319, (1975); He Z., Yu W., Stable Feature Selection for Biomarker Discovery, (2010); James W., Stein C., Estimation with quadratic loss, Proceedings of the Fourth Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, 1, pp. 361-379, (1961); Karaboga D., An Idea Based on Honey Bee Swarm for Numerical Optimization, (2005); Karaboga D., Ozturk C., A novel clustering approach: Artificial bee colony (abc) algorithm, Applied Soft Computing, 11, 1, pp. 652-657, (2011); Ledoit O., Wolf M., Improved estimation of the covariance matrix of stock returns with an application to portfolio selection, Journal of Empirical Finance, 10, 5, pp. 603-621, (2003); Ledoit O., Wolf M., A well-conditioned estimator for large-dimensional covariance matrices, Journal of Multivariate Analysis, 88, 2, pp. 365-411, (2004); Listgarten J., Emili A., Statistical and computational methods for comparative proteomic profiling using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, Molecular & Cellular Proteomics, 4, 4, pp. 419-434, (2005); Massart D.L., Smeyers-Verbeke A.J., Practical Data Handling Visual Presentation of Data by Means of Box Plots, (2005); Mohd Shukran M.A., Chung Y.Y., Yeh W.C., Wahid N., Ahmad Zaidi A.M., Artificial bee colony based data mining algorithms for classification tasks, Modern Applied Science, 5, 4, (2011); Ressom H.W., Varghese R.S., Drake S.K., Hortin G.L., Abdel-Hamid M., Loffredo C.A., Goldman R., Peak selection from maldi-tof mass spectra using ant colony optimization, Bioinformatics, 23, 5, pp. 619-626, (2007); Sanavia T., Aiolli F., Da San Martino G., Bisognin A., Di Camillo B., Improving biomarker list stability by integration of biological knowledge in the learning process, BMC Bioinformatics, 13, SUPPL. 4, (2012); Schafer J., Strimmer K., Et al., A shrinkage approach to large-scale covariance matrix estimation and implications for functional genomics, Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology, 4, 1, (2005); SyarifahAdilah M., Abdullah R., Venkat I., Abc algorithm as feature selection for biomarker discovery in mass spectrometry analysis, 2012 4th Conference on Data Mining and Optimization (DMO), pp. 67-72, (2012); Yao J., Chang C., Salmi M., Hung Y., Loraine A., Roux S., Genome-scale cluster analysis of replicated microarrays using shrinkage correlation coefficient, BMC Bioinformatics, 9, 1, (2008); Yusoff S.A.M., Venkat I., Yusof U.K., Abdullah R., Bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms for biomarker identification in mass spectrometry analysis, International Journal of Natural Computing Research (IJNCR), 3, 2, pp. 64-85, (2012)","","","","IEEE-Seccion Espana; IEEE Systems; Man and Cybernetics - Capitulo Espanol; AEPIA; Ayuntamiento de Salamanca","8th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems, HAIS 2013","11 September 2013 through 13 September 2013","Salamanca","99721","16113349","978-364240845-8","","","English","Lect.

The design is structured to utilize the lowest number of qubits. First, the main components of AES-128 are designed as quantum circuits and then combined to construct the quantum version of AES-128. Some of the most efficient approaches in classical hardware implementations are adopted to construct the circuits of the multiplier and multiplicative inverse in F2[ x] / (x8+ x4+ x3+ x+ 1). The results show that 928 qubits are sufficient to implement AES-128 as a quantum circuit. Moreover, to maintain the key uniqueness when the quantum AES-128 is employed as a Boolean function within a Black-box in other key searching quantum algorithms, a method with a cost of 930 qubits is also proposed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Block cipher; Circuit optimization; Grover search; Quantum cryptanalysis; Quantum simulation; Symmetric cryptography","Boolean functions; Hardware; Inverse problems; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Block ciphers; Circuit optimization; Grover search; Quantum cryptanalysis; Quantum simulations; Symmetric cryptography; Cryptography","","","","","","","Rivest R.L., Shamir A., Adleman L., A method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems, Commun.

The SNN can be applied for simulating the brain and its functions, as well as it is able to be employed for different applications such as pattern classification. Different methods have been proposed for supervised training of SNN, however, most of them were validated based on using the classical XOR problem, and they consume long training time if other problems are considered. This paper proposes a new supervised training method for SNN by adapting the Enhanced-Mussels Wandering Optimization algorithm. In addition, a SNN model for pattern classification is proposed. The proposed work is used for pattern classification of real-world problems. The obtained results indicate that the proposed method is competitive alternative in terms of classification accuracy and training time. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Metaheuristic; Mussels wandering optimization; Optimization; Pattern classification; Spiking neural networks; Supervised training","Intelligent agents; Molluscs; Neural networks; Optimization; Pattern recognition; Classification accuracy; Metaheuristic; Multi layer perceptron networks; Optimization algorithms; Real-world problem; Spiking neural network(SNN); Spiking neural networks; Supervised trainings; Network layers","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PSKOM/8630022)","","Maass W., Networks of spiking neurons: the third generation of neural network models, Neural Netw, 10, 9, pp. 1659-1671, (1997); Ghosh-Dastidar S., Adeli H., Spiking neural networks, Int J Neural Syst, 19, 4, pp. 295-308, (2009); Chandhok C., Chaturvedi S., Adaptation of spiking neural networks for image clustering, Int J Video Image Proces Netw Secur IJVIPNS-IJENS, 12, 3, pp. 8-13, (2012); Mohemmed A., Schliebs S., Matsuda S., Kasabov N., Training spiking neural networks to associate spatio-temporal inputoutput spike patterns, Neurocomputing, 107, pp. 3-10, (2013); Belatreche A., Maguire L., McGinnity M., Advances in design and application of spiking neural networks, Soft Comput, 11, 3, pp. 239-248, (2007); Ghosh-Dastidar S., Adeli H., Third Generation Neural networks: spiking neural networks.

The FPA is a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm based on the pollination process of flowers flowering plants. MSA is an alignment of three or more sequences. MSA is used in many applications such as protein structure prediction, phylogenetic analysis, and genome primer identification. In research of MSA, a challenging problem is how to find the MSA that maximises the SP (Sum-of-Pairs) score. This problem is an NP-complete problem.

A metaheuristic is an evolutionary algorithm that does not require the functions in the problem to satisfy specific conditions or mathematical properties. A recently proposed metaheuristic is the harmony search algorithm, which was inspired by the music improvisation process and has been applied successfully in the solution of various global optimization problems. However, the overall performance of this algorithm and its convergence properties are quite sensitive to the initial parameter settings. Several improvements of the harmony search algorithm have been proposed to incorporate self-adaptive features. In these modified versions of the algorithm, the parameters are automatically tuned during the optimization process to achieve superior results. This paper proposes a new dynamic and self-adaptive harmony search algorithm in which two of the optimization parameters, the pitch adjustment rate and the bandwidth, are auto-tuned. These two parameters have substantial influence on the quality of the final solution. The proposed algorithm utilizes two new quality measures to dynamically drive the optimization process: the current best-to-worst ratio of the harmony memory fitness function and the improvisation acceptance rate. The key difference between the proposed algorithm and most competing methods is that the values of the pitch adjustment rate and bandwidth are determined independently of the current improvisation count and therefore vary dynamically rather than monotonically. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over various other recent methods based on several common benchmarking functions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The process of duplication is done by copying each data bit from the master device to the targeted device including unused memory region. However, to duplicate a 64 GB embedded MultiMedia Card (eMMC) memory is usually very time-consuming which is between 2 and 7 h; plus the speed specification claimed by the vendor is not the same when it is tested during benchmarking process. Therefore, this paper describes a proposed technique to improve eMMC duplication process by adopting the data storage and data transmission concepts such as reducing the data size using compression and sorting technique, where the algorithm needs to be optimized from the sequential level (data structure, data flow, etc.) which includes the significant impact of data type and data size during the duplication process. This study also extends these techniques by using heterogeneous collection of dataset or digital data to serve the true purpose of flash storage. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Compression; Data transfer; Duplication; Sorting","","","","","","Collaborative Research in Engineering, Science and Technology; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST","Acknowledgements This work was supported by Collaborative Research in Engineering, Science and Technology (CREST) and Sophic Automation Sdn Bhd under P13C2-2014 Grant.","Schoenherrsteven E., The Digital Revolution, (2004); Chiao M.L., Chang D.W., Hybridlog: An Efficient Hybrid-Mapped Flash Translation Layer for Modern NAND Flash Memory; Zhang C., Wang Y., Wang T., Chen R., Liu D., Shao Z., Deterministic crash recovery for NAND flash based storage systems, Proceedings of Design Automation Conference, pp. 1-6, (2014); Xie W., Chen Y., Roth P.C., ASA-FTL: An adaptive separation aware flash translation layer for solid state drives, Parallel Comput, (2016); Shim H., Kim J.S., Maeng S., BEST: Best-effort energy saving techniques for NAND flash-based hybrid storage, IEEE Trans Consum Electron, 58, 3, (2012); Tseng H.W., Grupp L.M., Swanson S., Underpowering NAND flash: Profits and perils, Proceedings of the 50Th Annual Design Automation Conference, (2013); Jimenez X., Novo D., Ienne P., Wear unleveling: Improving NAND flash lifetime by balancing page endurance, FAST, 14, pp. 47-59, (2014); Luo Y., Cai Y., Ghose S., Choi J., Mutlu O., WARM: Improving NAND flash memory lifetime with write-hotness aware retention management, 2015 31St Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST), pp. 1-14, (2015); Jeong J., Song Y., Hahn S.S., Lee S., Kim J., Dynamic erase voltage and time scaling for extending lifetime of NAND flash-based SSDs, IEEE Trans Comput, 66, 4, (2017); Gal E., Toledo S., Algorithms and data structures for flash memories, ACM Comput Surv (CSUR), 37, 2, pp. 138-163, (2005); Parthey D., Analyzing Real-Time Behavior of Flash Memories, (2007); Geographic Information Systems and Science, (2001); Algorithm Design under Consideration of Different Resources and a Faulty World; Micheloni R., Marelli A., Commodaro S., NAND overview: From memory to systems, Inside NAND Flash Memories, pp. 19-53, (2010); CMOS Processors and Memories, (2010); Na G.J., Moon B.K., Lee S.W., IPL B+-tree for Flash Memory Database Systems.

IPv6 depends heavily on NDP, which appears in the network in the form of ICMPv6. If ICMP is disabled or dropped from the network, IPv6 does not operate, in contrast to IPv4.

In Malaysia, medication errors have critically increased in the past few years and this phenomenon requires immediate academic and managerial attention. This study aimed to determine whether the effective use of HIS could predict the effects of the system, records, service, and knowledge qualities on the performance of clinicians. A total of 1200 surveys were administered to clinicians in different health institutions with HISs. The mediation effects based on 817 usable data were analyzed using partial least squares (PLS). In the path model, results demonstrated that effective use had a positive effect on the outcome variable and partially mediated the positive effects of quality predictors towards enhanced user performance. In other words, effective use of HISs increased the performance of clinicians through the ease of system functions and features, well-organized contents, and minimal data entry errors in EHRs, onsite technical support, and efficiency of drug order entry and decision support tools usage. Future evaluation studies of HIS should integrate effective use, and hospitals must strongly consider this predictor for the system upgrade or new implementation to avert medical errors when the use of the system is compulsory. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Clinician performance; Electronic health records; Health information systems; Information management; Partial least squares","","","","","","","","Abu Bakar N., Khalid K.

Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is an NP-hard problem in the sequence alignment. In the last three decades, the MSA problem has drawn a great deal of interest from biologists and scientists. It is an essential method to identify the structural and behavioural attributes of biomolecules present in organisms and vital to biological processes. Nature-inspired algorithms are one of the approaches to solve the MSA problem of aligning multiple sequences at a time. They construct powerful tools to overpower traditional optimization techniques to find an accurate solution. This investigative work (HHO-MSA) brings a new nature-inspired algorithm known as the Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO) Algorithm to solve the MSA problem. HHO's key influence is the cooperative behaviour and hunting style of the Harris hawks in nature called the surprise pounce. The computational results across five references of the BAliBASE dataset proven the proposed HHO-MSA method's effectiveness by reaching great results (up to 83.5% optimum solutions). Findings were statistically supported while comparing it with other established literature works to solve the MSA problem. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Behavioral research; Biomimetics; Data Science; Molecular biology; NP-hard; Optimization; Biological process; Computational results; Multiple sequence alignments; Multiple sequences; Nature inspired algorithms; Optimization techniques; Optimum solution; Sequence alignments; Intelligent computing","","","","","","","Thompson J D, Thierry J C, Poch O, Bioinformatics, 19, pp. 1155-1161, (2003); Wang L, Jiang T, Journal of computational biology, 1, pp. 337-348, (1994); Do C B, Katoh K, Methods Mol Biol, 484, pp. 379-413, (2008); Needleman S B, Wunsch C D, J Mol Biol, 48, pp. 443-453, (1970); Smith T F, Waterman M S, J Mol Biol, 147, pp. 195-197, (1981); Heringa J, Taylor W R, Curr Opin Struct Biol, 7, pp. 416-421, (1997); Notredame C, Pharmacogenomics, 3, pp. 131-144, (2002); Eddy S R, BMC Bioinformatics, 3, (2002); Shyu C, Sheneman L, Foster J A, Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines, 5, pp. 121-144, (2004); Lipman D J, Altschul S F, Kececioglu J D, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 86, pp. 4412-4415, (1989); Hogeweg P, Hesper B, J Mol Evol, 20, pp. 175-186, (1984); Feng D F, Doolittle R F, Journal of Molecular Evolution, 25, pp. 351-360, (1987); Thompson J D, Higgins D G, Gibson T J, Nucleic Acids Res, 22, pp. 4673-4680, (1994); Thompson J D, Koehl P, Ripp R, Poch O, Proteins, 61, pp. 127-136, (2005); Goldberg D E, Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning, (1989); Holland J H, Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems: An Introductory Analysis with Applications to Biology, Control and Artificial Intelligence, (1992); Heidari A A, Mirjalili S, Faris H, Aljarah I, Mafarja M, Chen H, Future generation computer systems, 97, pp. 849-872, (2019); Wadud M S, Islam M R, Kundu N, Kabir M R, Multiple sequence alignment using chemical reaction optimization algorithm, Intelligent Systems Design and Applications, (2018); Gotoh O, J Mol Biol, 264, pp. 823-838, (1996); Katoh K, Misawa K, Kuma K, Miyata T, Nucleic Acids Res, 30, pp. 3059-3066, (2002); Katoh K, Kuma K, Toh H, Miyata T, Nucleic Acids Res, 33, pp. 511-518, (2005); Edgar R C, Nucleic Acids Res, 32, pp. 1792-1797, (2004); Yamada S, Gotoh O, Yamana H, BMC Bioinformatics, 7, (2006); Pei J, Grishin N V, Nucleic Acids Res, 34, pp. 4364-4374, (2006); Notredame C, Higgins D G, Nucleic Acids Res, 24, pp. 1515-1524, (1996); Naznin F, Sarker R, Essam D, BMC Bioinformatics, 12, (2011); Naznin F, Sarker R, Essam D, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 16, pp. 615-631, (2012); Gondro C, Kinghorn B P, Genet Mol Res, 6, pp. 964-982, (2007); Taheri J, Zomaya A Y, BMC Genomics, 10, (2009); Lee Z J, Su S F, Chuang C C, Liu K H, Applied Soft Computing, 8, pp. 55-78, (2008); Lam A Y, Li V O, IEEE transactions on evolutionary computation, 14, pp. 381-399, (2009); Kumar M, EXCLI J, 14, pp. 1232-1255, (2015); Zemali E A, Boukra A, 2016 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT), pp. 108-113, (2016); Kumar M, Om H, A Hybrid Bio-Inspired Algorithm for Protein Domain Problems, pp. 291-311, (2019); Thompson J D, Koehl P, Ripp R, Poch O, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, 61, pp. 127-136, (2005)","M.K.

IPv6 has an improved protocol in terms of security as it brought new functionalities, procedures, i.e., Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6). The ICMPv6 protocol is considered to be very important and represents the backbone of the IPv6, which is also responsible to send and receive messages in IPv6. However, IPv6 Inherited many attacks from the previous internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS is a thorny problem on the internet, being one of the most prominent attacks affecting a network result in tremendous economic damage to individuals as well as organizations. In this paper, an exhaustive evaluation and analysis are conducted anomaly detection DDoS attacks against ICMPv6 messages, in addition, explained anomaly detection types to ICMPv6 DDoS flooding attacks in IPv6 networks.

These Various types of data come from different sources. However, stragglers are a major bottleneck in big data processing, and hence the early detection and accurate identification of stragglers can have important impacts on the performance of big data processing. This work aims to assess five stragglers identification methods: Hadoop native scheduler, LATE Scheduler, Mantri, MonTool, and Dolly. The performance of these techniques was evaluated based on three benchmarked methods: Sort, Grep and WordCount. The results show that the LATE Scheduler performs the best and it would be efficient to obtain better results for stragglers identification. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The MWO algorithm has been used to solve linear and nonlinear functions and it has been adapted in supervised training of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Based on the latter application, the classification accuracy of ANN based on MWO training was on par with other algorithms. This paper proposes an enhanced version of MWO algorithm; namely Enhanced-MWO (E-MWO) in order to achieve an improved classification accuracy of ANN. In addition, this paper discusses and analyses the MWO and the effect of MWO parameters selection (especially, the shape parameter) on ANN classification accuracy. The E-MWO algorithm is adapted in training ANN and tested using well-known benchmarking problems and compared against other algorithms. The obtained results indicate that the E-MWO algorithm is a competitive alternative to other evolutionary and gradient-descent based training algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and training time. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Artificial Neural Networks; Meta-heuristic; Mussels Wandering Optimization; Optimization; Pattern Classification; Supervised Training","Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Molluscs; Neural networks; Optimization; Pattern recognition; Soft computing; Benchmarking problems; Classification accuracy; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Metaheuristic; Nonlinear functions; Parameters selection; Supervised trainings; Training algorithms; Data mining","","","","","","","Ghosh-Dastidar S., Adeli H., A new supervised learning algorithm for multiple spiking neural networks with application in epilepsy and seizure detection, J.

If they are, then we can just adapt the findings from studies of general entrepreneurs to academic entrepreneurs. Aldridge and Audretsch (2011), however, point out that it is unclear whether the findings concerning general entrepreneurs also hold for academic entrepreneurs. Although the general entrepreneurship literature is compelling, studies have not been explicitly linked to academic entrepreneurs (Goethner et al., 2009). In addition, the taxonomy of their findings is rarely presented comprehensively with the exception of the work by Rothaermel et al. (2007). Therefore, in this chapter, we will present a comprehensive discussion on the personal attributes of academic entrepreneurs based on empirical research over the last ten years. We focus on personal attributes because previous studies show that these have a stronger impact, or are more important determinants, than their departmentsí or universitiesí characteristics (Clarysse et al., 2011; DíEste and Patel, 2007; Gambardella et al., 2008). We find that these personal attributes, namely gender, age, status, social capital, attitudes, values, cognition, knowledge, ability, personal traits, human capital and motives, that are important determinants in general entrepreneurship are also consistently important determinants for academic entrepreneurship, with few exceptions. Some attributes may require a different unit or quality while some may be similar to general entrepreneurs. We also present suggestions for future research on academic entrepreneurship. © François Thérin 2013.","","","","","","","","","Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Aldridge T.T., Audretsch D.B., Does policy influence the commercialization route?

Ordinarily, sequences one above the other can produce the final alignment. This paper focuses on solving the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) problem by using a Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) that is hybridised with the profile technique. The FPA is considered a new meta-heuristic method based on a particular population. MSA is used in numerous applications, for example, an identification of conserved motifs, phylogenetic analysis, protein structure prediction and genome primer identification. In a study related to the MSA, a major challenge is attempting to propose a method for maximising the Sum-of-Pairs (SP) score and Column Score (CS) in order to obtain the most optimised MSA method. Accordingly, a profile technique is proposed to increase the quality of the MSA. The outcomes are compared against 7 other methods by using one standard of benchmark datasets. Our proposed method showed better results compared to other methods related to the group RV12 from Balibase3.0 dataset except for the MSAProbs method in terms of both measurements SP and CS scores. © 2019 IEEE.","Flower pollination algorithm (FPA);

However, IPv6 faces many security issues with its new design, such as a rogue Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) server attack. The DHCPv6 responsible for assigning the IPv6 address to clients and provide the client with network configuration parameters. A rogue DHCPv6-server can divert client to rogue servers such as Domain Name System (DNS), Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers. Therefore, security issues are vital. This paper proposes an approach to secure a DHCPv6-server against rogue DHCPv6-servers with a complete analysis of security challenges that are facing DHCPv6. The proposed approach uses Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) to prevent a rogue DHCPv6-server attack through verifying the source and the integrity of DHCPv6-server message whether it comes from a legitimate or rogue DHCPv6-server. The implementation and evolution of the proposed approach will be included in the authors’ future work. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","DHCPv6; DHCPv6 server; IPv6 local link network; Rouge DHCPv6 server attack","Cryptography; Electronic document identification systems; Soft computing; DHCPv6; Digital signature algorithms; Dynamic host configuration protocols; Internet protocol version 6; Link networks; Network configuration; Network time protocol; Server attacks; Internet protocols","","","","","","","Al-Ani A.K., Anbar M., Manickam S., Al-Ani A., Leau Y.-B., Proposed DAD-match security technique based on hash function to secure duplicate address detection in IPv6 link-local network, Roceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Information Technology, pp. 175-179, (2017); Al-Ani A.K., Anbar M., Manickam S., Al-Ani A., Leau Y.-B., Proposed DAD-match mechanism for securing duplicate address detection process in IPv6 link-local network based on symmetric-key algorithm, International Conference on Computational Science and Technology, pp. 108-118, (2017); (2018); Elejla O.E., Anbar M., Belaton B., Icmpv6-based dos and ddos attacks and defense mechanisms: Review, IETE Tech.

The ability to be successful in Big Data is related to the maturity level of the organization. A Maturity Model (MM) is a tool that can be applied to assess the 'As-is' situation regarding specific key dimensions, where the maturity levels indicate an organization's current capabilities and the desirable state. Most of the available literature on the Maturity Models for Big Data is still in white papers, reports, and internet materials from developers' websites. The existing literature might not have covered all the available Maturity Models for Big Data. This paper reviewed the existing literature to achieve three objectives: first, to provide a comprehensive overview about the Maturity, Maturity Model, Capability Maturity Model, and the Maturity Model for Big Data; second, to identify the existing Big Data Maturity Models and to summarize the most used models; third, to highlight the limitations of the existing Big Data Maturity Models. © 2019 IEEE.","Big Data; Big Data Maturity Model; Capability Maturity Model; Capability Maturity Model Integration; Maturity; Maturity Model","Economics; Software engineering; Capability maturity model integration; Capability maturity models; Data maturity; Maturity; Maturity model; Big data","","","","","","","Chen M., Mao S., Liu Y., Big data: A survey, Mob.

In this study, we identified the risk factors of mammographic density in Asian women and quantified the impact of breast density on the severity of breast cancer. We collected data from Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, a research-and university-based hospital located in Kelantan, Malaysia. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyse the data. Five significant factors were found to be associated with mammographic density: age (OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.96), number of children (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.96), body mass index (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.92), menopause status (yes vs. no, OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.82), and BI-RADS classification (2 vs. 1, OR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.84; 3 vs. 1, OR: 3.25; 95% CI: 1.86, 5.66; 4 vs. 1, OR: 3.75; 95% CI: 1.88, 7.46; 5 vs. 1, OR: 2.46; 95% CI: 1.21, 5.02; 6 vs. 1, OR: 2.50; 95% CI: 0.65, 9.56).

It focusses on distinguishing PNe from other types of objects, as well as their morphological classification. We adopted the deep transfer learning approach using three ImageNet pre-trained algorithms. This study was conducted using images from the Hong Kong/Australian Astronomical Observatory/Strasbourg Observatory H-alpha Planetary Nebula research platform database (HASH DB) and the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS). We found that the algorithm has high success in distinguishing True PNe from other types of objects even without any parameter tuning. The Matthews correlation coefficient is 0.9. Our analysis shows that DenseNet201 is the most effective DL algorithm. For the morphological classification, we found for three classes, Bipolar, Elliptical and Round, half of objects are correctly classified. Further improvement may require more data and/or training. We discuss the trade-offs and potential avenues for future work and conclude that deep transfer learning can be utilized to classify wide-field astronomical images. © 2020 by the authors.

Cloud data center selection challenges are compounded by ever-increasing users' requests and the number of data centers required to execute these requests. Cloud service broker policy defines cloud data center's selection, which is a case of an NP-hard problem that needs a precise solution for an efficient and superior solution. Differential evolution algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm characterized by its speed and robustness, and it is well suited for selecting an appropriate cloud data center. This paper presents a modified differential evolution algorithm-based cloud service broker policy for the most appropriate data center selection in the cloud computing environment. The differential evolution algorithm is modified using the proposed new mutation technique ensuring enhanced performance and providing an appropriate selection of data centers. The proposed policy's superiority in selecting the most suitable data center is evaluated using the CloudAnalyst simulator. The results are compared with the state-of-arts cloud service broker policies. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

This paper aims to present the result of a comparative analysis on the performance of three classifier algorithms, namely, decision tree, random forest, and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), to detect an IPv6-based attack, specifically ICMPv6-based DoS flooding. The experimental results showed that there is no single best algorithm that outperforms others in all measured metrics. k-NN has the lowest false-positive outcome while RF has the lowest false-negative (missed attacks) percentage. © 2016 IEEE.","Decision tree; Intrusion detection system; IPv6-based attack; k-nearest neighbor; Random forest","Computer crime; Data mining; Decision trees; Internet protocols; Mercury (metal); Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Network security; Classification algorithm; Classifier algorithms; Comparative analysis; Comparative performance analysis; Intrusion Detection Systems; IPv6-based attack; K-nearest neighbors; Random forests; Intrusion detection","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PNAV/6313272)","This research is supported by Short Term Research Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) No: 304/PNAV/6313272.","Chen R.-C., Cheng K.-F., Chen Y.-H., Hsieh C.-F., Using rough set and support vector machine for network intrusion detection system, Intelligent Information and Database Systems, 2009.

The reliability and accuracy of sequence analyses depend on the quality of MSA. Including anchor points into multiple sequence alignment to be aligned has been proved to be a good way to increase the quality of MSA. In this paper, we have applied Shared Near Neighbors method to construct the anchor points as partial alignment columns which will be aligned for final output. These anchor points can be used as guide with DIALIGN-TX method to overcome the limitation of DIALIGN-TX to increase the accuracy of final MSA. The results showed 4-8% improvement in the six reference sets in BAliBASE 3.0 benchmark regarding to CS score compared to DIALIGN-TX. In addition, it achieved the highest overall mean Q-score and CS score comparing to other MSA methods in IRMBASE 2.0 benchmark. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","anchor points; multiple sequence alignment;

Previous works have separately focused on the prediction part or the implementation of the water monitoring system that involves the integration of sensors through the Internet of Things (IoT). These studies lack in terms of discussion of both IoT with the algae ecological domain and prediction method. Therefore, this paper takes the initiative to provide a wider coverage on the end-to-end process including the assembly and integration of sensors, data acquisition and predictive modelling using data-driven approaches, for example, machine learning, deep learning and deep time series forecasting algorithm for future algal bloom outbreak mitigation. This paper believes that discussion in a complete framework perspective based on the execution of each phase is important besides providing a true understanding of the algae growth factors and prediction problems to achieve a robust prediction algorithm for algal growth. In the end, this paper presents proof that selecting the right features and utilising time series with deep learning are much better for tackling the issues of highly non-linear and dynamic algae ecological data that are briefly introduced in this paper. Among all the algorithms selected, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) is the best fit for the prediction method and has outperformed other basic machine learning methods in accurately predicting algal growth through the prediction of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) as a strong indicator of algal presence for coastal studies.  © 2013 IEEE.","Deep learning; harmful algal bloom (HAB); IoT; long short-term memory (LSTM); machine learning; time series forecasting","Algae; Data acquisition; Deep learning; Forecasting; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Monitoring; Time series; Water management; Water pollution; Water quality; Coastal water quality; Data-driven approach; Harmful algal blooms; Internet of thing (IOT); Machine learning methods; Predictive modelling; Time series forecasting; Water monitoring systems; Predictive analytics","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (TRGS/1/2018/USM/01/5/4-203)","This work was supported by the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education through the Transdisciplinary Research Grant under Grant TRGS/1/2018/USM/01/5/4-203.PKOMP.67612.","Huang Y.F., Ang S.Y., Lee K.M., Lee T.S., Quality of water resources in Malaysia, Res.

A biologically inspired machine learning-based approach is proposed in this study to detect RA flooding attacks. The proposed technique exploits information gain ratio (IGR) and principal component analysis (PCA) for feature selection and a support vector machine (SVM)-based predictor model, which can also detect input traffic anomaly. A real benchmark dataset obtained from National Advanced IPv6 Center of Excellence laboratory is used to evaluate the proposed technique. The evaluation process is conducted with two experiments. The first experiment investigates the effect of IGR and PCA feature selection methods to identify the most contributed features for the SVM training model. The second experiment evaluates the capability of SVM to detect RA flooding attacks. The results show that the proposed technique demonstrates excellent detection accuracy and is thus an effective choice for detecting RA flooding attacks. The main contribution of this study is identification of a set of new features that are related to RA flooding attack by utilizing IGR and PCA algorithms. The proposed technique in this paper can effectively detect the presence of RA flooding attack in IPv6 network. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","IGR; IPv6 security; Network security; PCA; RA flooding attack; SVM","Artificial intelligence; Floods; Internet protocols; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network security; Next generation networks; Principal component analysis; Routers; Support vector machines; Benchmark datasets; Biologically inspired; Feature selection methods; Flooding attacks; Information gain ratio; IPv6 security; Machine learning approaches; Router Advertisements; Feature extraction","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/M026981/1)","Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions, which greatly helped improve the quality of the paper.

In this study, a quantum implementation of a classical block cipher is presented. A quantum circuit for a classical block cipher of a polynomial size of quantum gates is proposed. The entire work has been tested on a quantum mechanics simulator called libquantum. First, the functionality of the proposed quantum cipher is verified and the experimental results are compared with those of the original classical version. Then, quantum attacks are conducted by using Grover’s algorithm to recover the secret key. The proposed quantum cipher is used as a black box for the quantum search. The quantum oracle is then queried over the produced ciphertext to mark the quantum state, which consists of plaintext and key qubits. The experimental results show that for a key of n-bit size and key space of N such that N= 2 n, the key can be recovered in O(π4N) computational steps. © 2016, The Author(s).","Block cipher; Grover search; Quantum cryptanalysis; Quantum simulation; Symmetric cryptography","","","","","","","","Akihiro Y., Ishizuka Hirokazu quantum cryptanalysis of block ciphers.

Therefore, scientists and researchers dedicated tremendous time and efforts to prevent the growth of algal by monitoring and profiling the water quality index. However, provided that the expensive cost of the commercialised sensor, including the dynamic and causality of algae, complicated the process, this article discusses on the progress of a low-priced realtime monitoring system for water quality through the solar panel to perform preliminary studies on the water quality data. Profiling environmental readings is a crucial step in gaining an insight into the algal bloom growth. Furthermore, the real-time data collection from the system was continuously performed at the sea, leading to consistent data transfer to the server through a 3G network despite the remote monitoring. Notably, the two benefits of this system included the solution to the laborious process, which was based on manual sample collections. The second benefit was the database, which provided information on safe WQI for the fish farm and insight about algae growth, which could be used in the predictive modelling phase.  © 2020 ACM.","Algae Bloom; Big Data; Dissolve Oxygen; Monitoring System; pH; Real-Time; Salinity; Temperature; Total Dissolved Solid (TDS); Turbidity; Water Quality; Water Quality Index (WQI)","Algae; Aquaculture; Big data; Costs; Data transfer; Predictive analytics; Water quality; Harmful algal blooms; Predictive modelling; Real time data collections; Real-time monitoring systems; Remote monitoring; Water quality data; Water quality indexes; Water quality monitoring systems; Monitoring","","","","","Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (TRGS/1/2018/USM/01/5/4-203); Universiti Sains Malaysia","Funding text 1: This work is a collaborative research between Universiti Sains Malaysia and Sg Udang Fish Farm Community.

In this paper, a subpopulation-based parallel Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm on OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is proposed. The obligate brood parasitism behavior and mapping of the CS to TSP are explored to design the parallelization approach on OpenMP's fork-join model. The proposed parallel algorithm has been tested with symmetric instances from TSPLIB. Results show the subpopulation-based CS via random walk achieved superlinear speedup up to 42× and 1054% efficiency on OpenMP running 4 cores processor with superior percentage deviation against TSPLIB optimal solutions on small cities ranging from 51 to 101 cities, and only started to deviate significantly with 4461 cities. OpenMP subpopulation-based CS speedup also recorded at least 17× and up to 36× higher than related works in parallel CS. Overall results demonstrate that multi-threaded parallelism is very effective to achieve speedup for population-based evolutionary algorithms by dividing the main population into subpopulations to increase diversity on solution exploration. © 2016 IEEE.","Cuckoo search; Evolutionary algorithms; Meta-heuristics; OpenMP; Parallel algorithms; Traveling salesman problem","Application programming interfaces (API); Information science; Optimization; Parallel algorithms; Traveling salesman problem; Cuckoo search algorithms; Cuckoo searches; Meta heuristics; Multi-processing; OpenMP; Optimal solutions; Percentage deviation; Superlinear speedups; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (203/P-KOMP/6711425); Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work is supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia and has been funded by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia via Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) titled by Image Segmentation Using Hybrid Fuzzy C-Means Clustering and Watershed Regions-Based Segmentation Algorithms on General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (203/P-KOMP/6711425).

Thus, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of the medical workflow of the disease. Therefore, this study aims to develop a supplementary diagnostic tool for radiologists using ensemble transfer learning and digital mammograms. The digital mammograms and their associated information were collected from the department of radiology and pathology at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia. Thirteen pre-trained networks were selected and tested in this study. ResNet101V2 and ResNet152 had the highest mean PR-AUC, MobileNetV3Small and ResNet152 had the highest mean precision, ResNet101 had the highest mean F1 score, and ResNet152 and ResNet152V2 had the highest mean Youden J index. Subsequently, three ensemble models were developed using the top three pre-trained networks whose ranking was based on PR-AUC values, precision, and F1 scores. The final ensemble model, which consisted of Resnet101, Resnet152, and ResNet50V2, had a mean precision value, F1 score, and Youden J index of 0.82, 0.68, and 0.12, respectively. Additionally, the final model demonstrated balanced performance across mammographic density. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the good performance of ensemble transfer learning and digital mammograms in breast cancer risk estimation. This model can be utilised as a supplementary diagnostic tool for radiologists, thus reducing their workloads and further improving the medical workflow in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; Asian women; breast cancer; deep learning; diagnostic screening; mammography; radiologists; transfer learning","Article; artificial intelligence; breast cancer; breast density; breast imaging reporting and data system; cancer diagnosis; cancer risk; comparative study; controlled study; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; digital mammography; female; human; image processing; Malaysia; residual neural network; sensitivity and specificity; transfer of learning; Youden index","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/SKK03/USM/02/1)","This research was funded by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) of the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia (FRGS/1/2019/SKK03/USM/02/1).","Arnold M., Morgan E., Rumgay H., Mafra A., Singh D., Laversanne M., Vignat J., Gralow J.R., Cardoso F., Siesling S., Et al., Current and future burden of breast cancer: Global statistics for 2020 and 2040, Breast, 66, pp. 15-23, (2022); Ferlay J., Colombet M., Soerjomataram I., Parkin D.M., Pineros M., Znaor A., Bray F., Cancer statistics for the year 2020: An overview, Int.

The selection of the best breeds will produce quality crops and increase crop yields. This study aimed to examine machine learning (ML) in oil palm breeding (OPB) using factors other than genetic data. A new conceptual framework to adopt the ML in OPB will be presented at the end of this paper. At first, data types, phenotype traits, current ML models, and evaluation technique will be identified through a literature survey. This study found that the phenotype and genotype data are widely used in oil palm breeding programs. The average bunch weight, bunch number, and fresh fruit bunch are the most important characteristics that can influence the genetic improvement of progenies. Although machine learning approaches have been applied to increase the productivity of the crop, most studies focus on molecular markers or genotypes for plant breeding, rather than on phenotype. Theoretically, the use of phenotypic data related to offspring should predict high breeding values by using ML. Therefore, a new ML conceptual framework to study the phenotype and progeny data of oil palm breeds will be discussed in relation to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). © 2021 by the authors.

This technology benefits various agricultural industries, such as the palm oil sector, which possesses one of the most sustainable industries worldwide. Hence, an in-depth analysis was conducted, which is derived from previous research on ML utilisation in the palm oil in-dustry. The study provided a brief overview of widely used features and prediction algorithms and critically analysed current the state of ML-based palm oil prediction.

Timeliness of data is important in making major decision. However, the manual data labeling method is slow and expensive, it also cannot cope with this enormous amount of data. We investigated the literature of sentiment analysis and discovered most of the works using manual data labeling. We propose semi-supervised learning as a method that helps to reducing the effort and time needed in data labeling as it uses a combination of small amount of labeled data and a large pool of unlabeled data for model training. In our work, we trained semi-supervised deep neural network with different settings and compared the model performances to a baseline, the supervised deep neural network trained with same number of labeled data. From the results, we can see that the unlabeled data is useful in improving the data performances. But it is not a guarantee, the unlabeled data must be handled with care otherwise degraded the model performances. © 2019 The Authors.","Deep learning; Semi-supervised learning; Sentiment classification","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Information systems; Information use; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Supervised learning; Data labeling; Data performance; Model performance; Model training; Semi- supervised learning; Semi-supervised; Sentiment classification; Unlabeled data; Classification (of information)","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9)","This research is supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE) under the project code, FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9 and title, Automated Big Data Annotation for Training Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Model in Sentiment Classification.","Liu, Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining, (2012); Hutto C.J., Gilbert E., Vader: A parsimonious rule-based model for sentiment analysis of social media text, Proceedings of the Eighth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 216-225, (2014); Priyani G., Gupta V., Singh V.K., Ghose U., A linguistic rule-based approach for aspect-level sentiment analysis of movie reviews, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, (2017); Agarwal B., Mittal N., Machine learning approach for sentiment analysis, Socio-Affective Computing, pp. 21-45, (2015); Chiong R., Et al., A sentiment analysis-based machine learning approach for financial market prediction via news disclosures, Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion on - GECCO'18, pp. 278-279, (2018); Tripathy A., Agrawal A., Rath S.K., Classification of sentiment reviews using n-gram machine learning approach, Expert Systems with Applications, 57, pp. 117-126, (2016); Fernandez-Gavilanes, Alvarez-Lopez, Juncal-Martinez, Costa-Montenegro, Gonzalez-Castano, Unsupervised method for sentiment analysis in online texts, Expert Systems with Applications, 58, pp. 57-75, (2016); Tan, Phang, Chin, Anthony, Rule-based sentiment analysis for financial news, IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, pp. 1601-1606, (2015); Na, Kyaing, Khoo, Foo, Chang, Theng, Sentiment classification of drug reviews using a rule-based linguistic approach, ICADL 2012: The Outreach of Digital Libraries: A Globalized Resource Network, (2012); Prabowo, Thelwall, Sentiment analysis: A combined approach, Journal of Informetrics, 3, 2, pp. 143-157, (2009); Faulkner, Automated classification of stance in student essays: An approach using stance target information and the wikipedia link-based measure, Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, pp. 174-179, (2014); Lane, Clarke, Hender, On developing robust models for favourability analysis: Model choice, feature sets and imbalanced data, Decision Support Systems, 53, 4, pp. 712-718, (2012); Araque, Corcuera-Platas, Sanchez-Rada, Iglesias, Enhancing deep learning sentiment analysis with ensemble techniques in social applications, Expert Systems with Applications, 77, pp. 236-246, (2017); Hassan, Mahmood, Deep learning approach for sentiment analysis of short texts, 3rd International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR), pp. 705-710, (2017); Dai, Le, Semi-supervised Sequence Learning, NIPS'15 Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3079-3087, (2015); Iosifidis, Ntoutsi, Large scale sentiment learning with limited labels, Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining - KDD'17, pp. 1823-1832, (2017); Levatic, Ceci, Kocev, Dzeroski, Semi-supervised Classification Trees, Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 49, 3, pp. 461-486, (2017); Pang, Lee, Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales, ACL'05 Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 115-124, (2005); Guan, Chen, Zhao, Zheng, Tan, Cai, Weakly-supervised deep learning for customer review sentiment classification, IJCAI'16 Proceedings of the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 3719-3725, (2016)","K.H.

However, there can be a delay in job processing in circumstances where tasks are assigned to bad or congested machines called ""straggler tasks""; which increases the time, power consumptions and therefore increasing the costs and leading to a poor performance of computing systems. This research proposes a hybrid MapReduce framework referred to as the combinatory late-machine (CLM) framework. Implementation of this framework will facilitate early and timely detection and identification of stragglers thereby facilitating prompt appropriate and effective actions.

Thus, evaluating whether the system has been effectively utilized is necessary, particularly regarding how it predicts the post-implementation primary care providers’ performance impact. Methods: Convenience sampling was employed for data collection in three government hospitals for 7 months. A standardized effectiveness survey for EHR systems was administered to primary health care providers (specialists, medical officers, and nurses) as they participated in medical education programs. Empirical data were assessed by employing partial least squares-structural equation modeling for hypothesis testing. Results: The results demonstrated that knowledge quality had the highest score for predicting performance and had a large effect size, whereas system compatibility was the most substantial system quality component. The findings indicated that EHR systems supported the clinical tasks and workflows of care providers, which increased system quality, whereas the increased quality of knowledge improved user performance. Conclusion: Given these findings, knowledge quality and effective use should be incorporated into evaluating EHR system effectiveness in health institutions. Data mining features can be integrated into current systems for efficiently and systematically generating health populations and disease trend analysis, improving clinical knowledge of care providers, and increasing their productivity. The validated survey instrument can be further tested with empirical surveys in other public and private hospitals with different interoperable EHR systems. © 2021, The Author(s).","Clinical practice guidelines; Clinician performance; Consolidated framework for implementation research; Effective use; Electronic health records; Evaluation; Information management; Knowledge quality; Partial least squares; Total hospital information system","Electronic Health Records; Health Personnel; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires; electronic health record; health care personnel; human; public hospital; questionnaire","","","","","Health Malaysia","The authors thank all physicians and nurses who took part in this study.

Worms use parts of the operating system that are automatic and usually invisible to the user. Worms commonly exhibit abnormal behaviors, which become noticeable only when their uncontrolled replication consumes system resources and consequently decelerates or halts other tasks completely. This paper proposes an effective approach for detecting the presence of TCP network worms. This approach consists of two phases: Statistical Cross-relation for Network Scanning (SCANS) phase and the Worm Correlation phase. The SCANS phase is used to detect the presence of the network scanning behavior of a network worm, while the worm correlation phase is used to detect the Destination Source Correlation (DSC) behavior of the network worm. The proposed approach has been tested with a simulated dataset obtained from the GTNetS simulator. The numerical results showed that the proposed approach is efficient and outperforms the well-known DSC approach in terms of detecting the presence of TCP network worm. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Destination Source Correlation (DSC); Intrusion Detection System (IDS); Malicious codes; Network scanning; TCP worm","Intrusion detection; Malware; Scanning; Destination-source correlations; Intrusion Detection Systems; Malicious codes; Network scanning; TCP worm; Computer crime","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","","Xu W., Zhang F., Zhu S., Toward worm detection in online social networks, Proceedings of the 26th annual computer security applications conference, pp. 11-20, (2010); Li P., Salour M., Su X., A survey of internet worm detection and containment, IEEE Commun Surv Tutor, 10, 1, pp. 20-35, (2008); Paul S., Mishra B.K., Survey of polymorphic worm signatures, Int J U E Service Sci Technol, 7, 3, pp. 129-150, (2014); Jiang D., Xu Z., Zhang P., Zhu T., A transform domain-based anomaly detection approach to network-wide traffic, J Netw Comput Appl, 40, pp. 292-306, (2014); Jiang D., Yao C., Xu Z., Qin W., Multi-scale anomaly detection for high-speed network traffic, Trans Emerg Telecommun Technol, 26, 3, pp. 308-317, (2015); Wang Y., Wen S., Xiang Y., Zhou W., Modeling the propagation of worms in networks: a survey, IEEE Commun Surv Tutor, 16, 2, pp. 942-960, (2014); Yang W., Gao Y.-P., Zhu Z.-L., Chang G.-R., Yao Y., Modelling, analysis and containment of passive worms in p2p networks, Int J Internet Protoc Technol, 8, 2, pp. 130-142, (2014); Moore D., Paxson V., Savage S., Shannon C., Staniford S., Weaver N., Inside the slammer worm, IEEE Secur Priv, 1, 4, pp. 33-39, (2003); Collins M.P., Reiter M.K., Hit-list worm detection and bot identification in large networks using protocol graphs, Proceedings of the 10th international conference on recent advances in intrusion detection, RAID’07, pp. 276-295, (2007); Jung J., Milito R.A., Paxson V., On the adaptive real-time detection of fast-propagating network worms, Detection of intrusions and malware, and vulnerability assessment, Springer, Berlin, pp. 175-192, (2007); Schechter S.E., Jung J., Berger A.W., Fast detection of scanning worm infections, Recent advances in intrusion detection.

They can result in serious economic damages for both organizations and individuals. Botnets comprise thousands of hosts being infected. Latest developed modes of the botnet utilize other channels of communication like domain name server (DNS) between CC servers and the hosts that are infected (the bots). Using substitute channels of communication enable the botnets to make a detour around the common network filters. Accordingly, a new rule-based method is introduced in this study. This method aims to detect the botnet based on DNS called Rule Botnet Detection (RBD). It can enhance the accuracy of detecting botnets based on DNS traffic. RBD uses a rule based on DNS query and response behaviors. Based on RBD, a higher accuracy level achieved with a lower false positive compared with other approaches. The findings, which were obtained based on the proposed approach, significantly increased the network's security situation awareness in the network's community. The findings concluded that the accuracy of the RBD in detection is (99.97 %) compared with approach named (PsyBoG), this approach can detect the malicious behavior that is caused by DNS traffic. © 2018 IEEE.","Botnet; Botnet Based on DNS; DNS","Botnet; Control systems; Botnet detections; Channels of communication; Domain name servers; Malicious behavior; Response behavior; Rule-based approach; Rule-based method; Security situation; Internet protocols","","","","","","","Silva S.S., Silva R.M., Pinto R.C., Salles R.M., Botnets: A survey, Computer Networks, 57, pp. 378-403, (2013); AsSadhan B., Bashaiwth A., Al-Muhtadi J., Alshebeili S., Analysis of P2P, IRC and http traffic for botnets detection, Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications, pp. 1-14, (2017); Bilge L., Sen S., Balzarotti D., Kirda E., Kruegel C., EXPOSURE: A passive DNS analysis service to detect and report malicious domains, ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC), 16, (2014); Harris K.D., General A., Lookout A., Cybersecurity in the Golden State, (2014); Silva K.K.E., How industry can help us fight against botnets: Notes on regulating private-sector intervention, International Review of Law, Computers & Technology, 31, pp. 105-130, (2017); Chen Y., Kintis P., Antonakakis M., Nadji Y., Dagon D., Farrell M., Measuring lower bounds of the financial abuse to online advertisers: A four year case study of the TDSS/TDL4 Botnet, Computers & Security, 67, pp. 164-180, (2017); Yu S., An Overview of DDoS Attacks, Distributed Denial of Service Attack and Defense, pp. 1-14, (2014); Kwon J., Lee J., Lee H., Perrig A., PsyBoG: A scalable botnet detection method for large-scale DNS traffic, Computer Networks, 97, pp. 48-73, (2016); Tiirmaa-Klaar H., Gassen J., Gerhards-Padilla E., Martini P., Botnets: How to Fight the Ever-Growing Threat on a Technical Level, pp. 41-97, (2013); Yukonhiatou C., Kittitornkun S., Kikuchi H., Sisaat K., Terada M., Ishii H., Temporal behaviors of Top-10 malware download in 2010-2012, Electrical Engineering Congress (IEECON), 2014 International, pp. 1-4, (2014); Club T.W., What Is a Botnet Attack and How Does It Work on a Computer, (2018); Agrawal N., Rizvi M., Singh S., An efficient cache based client side DNS resolution approach, Communication Systems and Network Technologies (CSNT), 2014 Fourth International Conference on, pp. 478-482, (2014); Li X., Wang J., Zhang X., Botnet detection technology based on DNS, Future Internet, 9, (2017); He Y., Zhong Z., Krasser S., Tang Y., Mining dns for malicious domain registrations, Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom) 2010 6th International Conference on, pp. 1-6, (2010); Davuth N., Kim S.-R., Classification of malicious domain names using support vector machine and bi-gram method, International Journal of Security and Its Aplications, 7, pp. 51-58, (2013); Rahim A., Bin Muhaya F.T., Discovering the botnet detection techniques, Security Technology, Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity, pp. 231-235, (2010); Govil J., Govil J., Criminology of botnets and their detection and defense methods, Electro/Information Technology 2007 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 215-220, (2007); Antonakakis M., Perdisci R., Dagon D., Lee W., Feamster N., Building a dynamic reputation system for DNS, USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 273-290, (2010); Antonakakis M., Perdisci R., Lee W., Vasiloglou I.I.N., Dagon D., Detecting malware domains at the upper DNS hierarchy, USENIX Security Symposium, (2011); Holz T., Gorecki C., Rieck K., Freiling F.C., Measuring and detecting fast-flux service networks, MNDSS, (2008); Perdisci R., Corona I., Dagon D., Lee W., Detecting malicious flux service networks through passive analysis of recursive dns traces, Computer Security Applications Conference 2009.

Further, high throughput of proteomics pattern derived from mass spectrometry analysis has embarked new paradigm for biomarker analysis through accessible body fluids such as serum, saliva, and urine. Recently, sophisticated computational techniques that are mimetic natural survival and behaviour of organisms have been widely adopted in problem-solving algorithm. As we put emphasis on feature selection algorithm, the most challenging phase in biomarker analysis is selecting most parsimonious features of voluminous mass spectrometry data. Therefore this study reveals the hybrid artificial bee colony and differential evolution as feature selection techniques exhibits comparable results.

However, during the simulation of pedestrian movement, there are several features that should be highlighted that will affect the movement speed and time. Hence, this preliminary research paper introduced the horizontal transition of microscopic movement with some features that create the closeness to the human behavior for the pedestrian simulation. This preliminary research introduced a simple case study on the closed area floor design and implemented some of the features discussed.

Each individual share cannot reveal clues about the secret image. Existing visual cryptography schemes suffer from problems such as pixel expansion, high computational complexity and poor decryption quality. To overcome these problems, we propose a new 2-out-of-2 secret sharing scheme for color images based on the binary dragonfly algorithm. The dragonfly algorithm is used to determine optimal color levels for the encryption process, which leads to reconstructed images with the higher quality upon decryption with minimal effect on the overall computational complexity. The proposed scheme is also non-expansible, whereby the share images are of the same size as the original secret image. This leads to reduced memory requirements as well as improved image quality. We analyze the strength of the proposed scheme based on a standard set of metrics which includes an evaluation of its resistance against cryptanalytic attacks, histogram, correlation, entropy and encryption quality. Results show that the proposed visual cryptography scheme has desired properties such as improved recovered image quality, near-ideal statistical characteristics and fast encryption speed, depicting an improvement over existing schemes. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Dragonfly algorithm; encryption; optimization algorithm; secret sharing; security; visual cryptography","Color; Computational complexity; Image enhancement; Image quality; Cryptanalytic attacks; Encryption technique; Reconstructed image; Reduced memory requirements; Secret sharing schemes; Statistical characteristics; Visual cryptography; Visual cryptography schemes; Cryptography","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1)","This work is supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), project number FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1.

Since its implementation 15 years ago, there has been the critical requirement for a systematic evaluation to assess its effectiveness in coping with the current system, task complexity, and rapid technological changes. The study aims to assess system quality factors to predict the performance of electronic health in a single public hospital in Malaysia. Methods Non-probability sampling was employed for data collection among selected providers in a single hospital for two months. Data cleaning and bias checking were performed before final analysis in partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Results and conclusions Convergent and discriminant validity assessments were satisfied the required criterions in the reflective measurement model. The structural model output revealed that the proposed adequate infrastructure, system interoperability, security control, and system compatibility were the significant predictors, where system compatibility became the most critical characteristic to influence an individual health care provider's performance. The previous DeLone and McLean information system success models should be extended to incorporate these technological factors in the medical system research domain to examine the effectiveness of modern electronic health record systems. In this study, care providers’ performance was expected when the system usage fits with patients’ needs that eventually increased their productivity. © 2016 King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences","Care providers’ performance; Electronic health records system; Evaluation; Partial least squares-structural equation modeling; System quality characteristics","Adult; Electronic Health Records; Female; Health Personnel; Health Services Research; Hospital Information Systems; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Health Care; adult; Article; computer security; convergent validity; discriminant validity; electronic health record; female; health care personnel; health care quality; hospital information system; human; job performance; Malaysia; male; middle aged; prediction; priority journal; public hospital; structural model; electronic health record; health services research","","","","","Canada Research Chairs; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University","The authors would like to thank the Director of Health Malaysia for permission to publish this paper.

When compared to other recently proposed facial recognition approaches, the proposed algorithms depict improved accuracy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Binary dragonfly algorithm; Biometrics; Classification; Facial recognition; Grasshopper algorithm; Optimization algorithm","Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Facial recognition; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Optimization algorithms; Face recognition","","","","","","","Ma H., Celik T., FER-Net: Facial expression recognition using densely connected convolutional network, Electron Lett, 55, 4, pp. 184-186, (2019); Chen Z., Huang W., Lv Z., Towards a face recognition method based on uncorrelated discriminant sparse preserving projection, Multimed Tools Appl, 76, 17, pp. 17669-17683, (2017); Chengeta K., Viriri S., A survey on facial recognition based on local directional and local binary patterns, 2018 Conference on Information Communications Technology and Society (ICTAS), pp. 1-6, (2018); Ojala T., Pietikainen M., Maenpaa T., Multiresolution gray-scale and rotation invariant texture classification with local binary patterns, IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell, 24, 7, pp. 971-987, (2002); Yan Z., Yuan C., Ant colony optimization for feature selection in face recognition, International Conference on Biometric Authentication, pp. 221-226, (2004); Connolly J.F., Granger E., Sabourin R., Evolution of heterogeneous ensembles through dynamic particle swarm optimization for video-based face recognition, Pattern Recogn, 45, 7, pp. 2460-2477, (2012); Jakhar R., Kaur N., Singh R., Face recognition using bacteria foraging optimization-based selected features, Int J Adv Comput Sci Appl, 1, 3, (2011); Agarwal V., Bhanot S., Radial basis function neural network-based face recognition using firefly algorithm, Neural Comput Appl, 30, 8, pp. 2643-2660, (2018); Islam K.T., Raj R.G., Al-Murad A., Performance of SVM, CNN, and ANN with BoW, HOG, and image pixels in face recognition, 2017 2Nd International Conference on Electrical & Electronic Engineering (ICEEE), pp. 1-4, (2017); Kumar M., Jindal M.K., Sharma R.K., ) k-nearest neighbor based offline handwritten Gurmukhi character recognition, 2011 International Conference on Image Information Processing, pp. 1-4, (2011); Kumar D., Feature selection for face recognition using DCT-PCA and Bat algorithm, Int J Inf Technol, 9, 4, pp. 411-423, (2017); Sinha P., Sinha P., Comparative study of chronic kidney disease prediction using KNN and SVM, Int J Eng Res Technol, 4, 12, pp. 608-612, (2015); Phillips P.J., Support vector machines applied to face recognition, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 803-809, (1999); Chang C.C., Lin C.J., LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines, ACM Trans Intell Syst Technol (TIST), 2, 3, pp. 1-27, (2011); Ghimire D., Jeong S., Lee J., Park S.H., Facial expression recognition based on local region specific features and support vector machines, Multimed Tools Appl, 76, 6, pp. 7803-7821, (2017); Gao Y., Lee H.J., Pose-invariant features and personalized correspondence learning for face recognition, Neural Comput Appl, 31, 1, pp. 607-616, (2019); Zhu Y., Xue J., Face recognition based on random subspace method and tensor subspace analysis, Neural Comput Appl, 28, 2, pp. 233-244, (2017); Lu Y., Cui J., Fang X., Enhancing sparsity via full rank decomposition for robust face recognition, Neural Comput Appl, 25, 5, pp. 1043-1052, (2014); Shukla A.K., Kanungo S., An automated face retrieval system using grasshopper optimization algorithm-based feature selection method, International Conference on Emerging Current Trends in Computing and Expert Technology, pp. 492-502, (2019); Sasirekha K., Thangavel K., Optimization of K-nearest neighbor using particle swarm optimization for face recognition, Neural Comput Appl, 31, 11, pp. 7935-7944, (2019); Gupta A., Goel L., Heuristic approach for face recognition using artificial bee colony optimization, The International Symposium on Intelligent Systems Technologies and Applications, pp. 209-223, (2016); Abd A.L., El-Hafeez T., Zaki A.M., Face Recognition Based on Grey Wolf Optimization for Feature Selection.

Visual cryptography (VC) is commonly used for this purpose but leads to additional computational overhead and lower recognition accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a multifactor authentication (MFA) system based on facial recognition that uses VC to secure biometric data, and also as a second authentication factor. The shares generated by VC are used as authentication tokens. These tokens are verified by the same facial recognition algorithm used to recognize a live facial image of the user. This simple albeit novel approach leads to lower computational cost because the same algorithm can be used to verify both authentication factors. To maximize verification accuracy, the binary dragonfly optimization algorithm is used to maximize the quality of the recovered image from VC, as well as the accuracy of the facial recognition algorithm itself through feature selection. The combination of these separate ideas leads to a novel MFA system that is efficient and highly accurate. Experimental verification based on various face image databases depicts the proposed system’s security, efficiency, and near-ideal recognition accuracy of up to 99.81%. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Authentication;

There is therefore, the increasing need to access databases at the fastest rates possible. In this paper, the decision tree indexing model (PDTIM) was parallelised, using a hybrid of distributed and shared memory on resident database; with horizontal and vertical growth through Message Passing Interface (MPI) and POSIX Thread (PThread), to accelerate the index building time. The PDTIM was implemented using 1, 2, 4 and 5 processors on 1, 2, 3 and 4 threads respectively. The results show that the hybrid technique improved the speedup, compared to a sequential version. It could be concluded from results that the proposed PDTIM is appropriate for large data sets, in terms of index building time. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Bioinformatics; Data mining; Decision tree; DNA; Indexing approaches; Protein; Searching algorithms","Algorithms; Computer Storage Devices; Data Mining; Databases, Genetic; Sequence Analysis; Systems Integration; bioinformatics; data mining; decision tree; distributed memory; DNA; DNA-protein sequence databases; index building; indexing approaches; large data sets; proteins; searching algorithms; sequences; shared memory programming; DNA; protein; algorithm; article; bioinformatics; data mining; data storage device; decision tree; distributed memory; DNA-protein sequence databases; genetic database; index building; indexing approaches; large data sets; methodology; searching algorithms; sequence analysis; sequences; shared memory programming; system analysis","","DNA, 9007-49-2; protein, 67254-75-5","","","","","Alsabti K., Ranka S., Singh V., CLOUDS: A decision tree classifier for large datasets, Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining KDD, 2p, (1998); Amado N., Gama J., Silva F., Parallel implementation of decision tree learning algorithms, Proceedings of the 10th Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence (EPIA2001, pp. 6-13, (2001); Amado N., Gama J., Silva F., Exploiting parallelism in decision tree induction, Proceedings of the Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Computing for Machine Learning, (2003); Ben-Haim Y., Tom-Tov E., A streaming parallel decision tree algorithm, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 11, pp. 849-872, (2010); Jaber K., Abdullah R., Abdul R.N., A framework for decision tree-based method to index data from large protein sequence databases, 2010 IEEE EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering & Sciences (IECBES 2010), (2010); Jaber K., Abdullah R., Abdul R.N., Indexing protein sequence/structure databases using decision tree: A preliminary study, 4th International Symposium on Information Technology 2010 (ITSim 2010), pp. 844-849, (2010); Jaber K.M., Abdullah R., Abdul R.N., Adapting decision tree-based method to index large DNA-protein sequence datasets, The Research Bulletin of Jordan ACM, 2, 3, pp. 57-73, (2011); Jin R., Agrawal G., Communication and memory efficient parallel decision tree construction, Proceedings of 3rd SIAM Conference on Data Mining, (2003); Jin R., Yang G., Agrawal G., Shared memory parallelization of data mining algorithms: Techniques, programming interface, and performance, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17, 1, pp. 71-89, (2005); Joshi M.V., Karypis G., Kumar V., ScalParC: A new scalable and efficient parallel classification algorithm for mining large datasets, IPPS98: Proceedings of the 12th International Parallel Processing Symposium, (1998); Narlikar G.J., A Parallel, Multithreaded Decision Tree Builder, Technical Report, CMUCS-98-184, (1998); Shafer J.C., Agrawal R., Mehta M., SPRINT: A scalable parallel classifier for data mining, VLDB96: Proceedings of the 22th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, pp. 544-555, (1996); Sreenivas M.K., Alsabti K., Ranka S., Parallel out-of-core divide-and-conquer techniques with application to classification trees, IPPS99/SPDP99: Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Parallel Processing and the 10th Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing, pp. 555-562, (1999); Srivastava A., Han E.-H., Kumar V., Singh V., Parallel formulations of decision-tree classification algorithms, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 3, 3, pp. 237-261, (1999); Tata S., Hankins R.A., Patel J.M., Practical suffix tree construction, VLDB04: Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, pp. 36-47, (2004); Tian Y., Tata S., Hankins R.A., Patel J.M., Practical methods for constructing suffix trees, VLDB Journal, 14, 3, pp. 281-299, (2005); Zaki M., Ho C.-T., Agrawal R., Parallel classification for data mining on sharedmemory multiprocessors, ICDE99: Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Data Engineering, (1999); Zaki M.J., Parallel and distributed data mining: An introduction, Revised Papers from Large-Scale Parallel Data Mining, pp. 1-23, (2000)","K.M.

The MWO has been used successfully for solving several optimization problems. This paper proposes an enhanced version of MWO, known as the enhanced-mussels wandering optimization (E-MWO) algorithm. The E-MWO aims to overcome the MWO shortcomings, such as lack in explorative ability and the possibility to fall in premature convergence. In addition, the E-MWO incorporates the self-adaptive feature for setting the value of a sensitive algorithm parameter. Then, it is adapted for supervised training of artificial neural networks, whereas pattern classification of real-world problems is considered. The obtained results indicate that the proposed method is a competitive alternative in terms of classification accuracy and achieve superior results in training time. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.","metaheuristic; Mussels wandering optimization; neural networks; pattern classification; self-adaptive","Molluscs; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Classification accuracy; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Metaheuristic; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Pre-mature convergences; self-adaptive; Sensitive algorithms; Optimization","","","","","UNIVERSITI, (1001/PSKOM/8630022)","The authors would like to thank Dr. Moh'd Khaled Shambour and Mr. Basem O.

For this purpose the efficiency of each protocol was analyzed to verify their behavior in non-uniform node density environments to determine the protocol which is more efficient on the basis of average end to end delay and normalized routing load (NRL). Network Simulation (NS-2) is applied to evaluate the protocols performances. The experiment results show that: CBRP protocol outperformed DSR and AODV in terms NRL when traffic sources greater than 20 sources and AODV outperforms DSR and CBRP in terms Average Delay for all traffic sources where AODV achieved the lowest delay. In addition, when node speed increases, the performance of (AODV, DSR and CBRP) protocols decreases. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","AODV; CBRP; DSR; MANET; Non-uniform; Routing protocols","Computer vision; Internet protocols; Mobile telecommunication systems; Robotics; Routing protocols; Ad hoc on demand distance vector; AODV; Average end-to-end delays; CBRP; Cluster based routing protocols; MANET; Non-uniform; Normalized routing loads; Mobile ad hoc networks","","","","","National Advanced IPV6; Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM; Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, HUSM","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank National Advanced IPV6 (NAV6) Centre, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia for its financial support.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank National Advanced IPV6 (NAV6) Centre, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia for its financial support.","Stojmenovic I., Handbook of Wireless Networks and Mobile Computing, (2002); Boukerche A., Et al., Routing protocols in ad hoc networks: A survey, Comput.

The purpose of using Markov is two folds, the first is to implement DGRED with multiple traffic classes, where in each class may have different priorities and the second is to enhance the mechanism of DGRED in stabilizing the average queue length (aql) between the allocated threshold values of minthreshold and maxthreshold, using variable calculating parameters, which is stored in the utilized states of Markov. The (MMBP-3) is employed to replace the conservative and widely used Bernoulli process (BP) in assessing DGRED method. Accordingly, a three dimensional discrete time Markov chain is provided to implement DGRED algorithm for three traffic classes where each dimension corresponds to a traffic class with its own parameters. The (MMBP-3) is deal with correlation and burstiness in the network traffic. The developed algorithm allows for faster response to the changes in the network, congestion-to-non-congestion and non-congestion-to-congestion, which lead to decrease packet losses and improvement of network performance. The proposed method is evaluated in comparison to the DGRED and other AQM methods, the results reveal that the proposed algorithm provides better performance compared to DGRED, RED, GRED, and Adaptive GRED in relations of delay packet loss, delay and mean queue length. The most appropriate arrival process for DGRED method is IBP for D, mql, PL, and DP while congestion occurs. Though, this process cannot discourse correlation. Thus MMBP-3 is the greatest choice as it detects both correlation and bursty things. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","(RED); Adaptive GRED; Congestion control; MMBP-3; Performance evaluation; Simulation","","","","","","","","Thiruchelvi G., Raja J., A Survey On Active Queue Management Mechanisms, IJCSNS International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 8, (2008);

With today's e-learning boom necessitated for the most part by COVID-19, its adoption has become increasingly mandatory. Thus, a systematic review should help focus and accelerate future research. This study systematically reviews, compiles, analyzes, and synthesizes the DM model studies in the e-learning context. This review adopts automatic and manual search methods to collect related studies from 2010 to 2020. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 92 primary studies are identified. The findings show that most of reviewed studies were conducted in the education field. The success category was the most highly investigated area from among the selected studies. Most studies developed a hybrid/extended model. Additionally, this study also identified gaps in the literature and recommends seven potential future areas requiring further investigation, such as conducting studies to examine the net benefits at the organizational level of analysis. To that end, the findings of this systematic review study provide an impactful contribution through offering a holistic review of the current state of DM model studies in an e-learning context, providing an essential reference for scholars in this field. © 2013 IEEE.","DeLone & McLean information systems success model; e-Learning systems; learning management systems; Moodle; systematic literature review","E-learning; Information systems; Information use; Body of knowledge; Critical dimension; Education and training; Inclusion and exclusions; Information systems success; Information systems success models; Organizational levels; Systematic Review; Learning systems","","","","","","","Aparicio M., Bacao F., Oliveira T., Trends in the E-learning ecosystem: A bibliometric study, Proc. 20th Americas Conf.

Cybercriminals always hunted for methods and means to unfairly benefit from this new technology. IPv6 is an improved protocol because it has built-in security mechanisms compared to Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). However, IPv6 has similar susceptibilities, which are inherited from several features of IPv4. Another issue involves that the new functionalities and procedures, which are found in IPv6, depend on Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6). A common vulnerability is the Denial of Service (DoS) attack. A combination of zombie hosts can form a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). The DoS and DDoS attacks often represent substantial hazards in today’s Internet as they can cause serious damages to organizations and disrupts Internet services. This research aims to provide a brief review of the latest studies and investigates on the detection in IPv6 networks using ICMPv6 messages and DoS, as well as DDoS attacks. Moreover, this work aims to introduce the proposed techniques, which utilized the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in an effort to combat cyber-attacks. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","DDoS; DoS; flooding; ICMPv6; Intrusion Detection System (IDS); IPv6; security","Denial-of-service attack; DOS; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Oil well flooding; DDoS; ICMPv6; Intrusion Detection Systems; IPv6; security; Network security","","","","","Iraq Airways Company; National Advanced IPv6 Centre, (IPv6); Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors would like to acknowledge the National Advanced IPv6 Centre (NAv6), Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for providing necessary facilities and support.

Several properties of a Parikh matrix have been extensively investigated. A picture array is a two-dimensional connected digitized rectangular array consisting of a finite number of pixels with each pixel in a cell having a label from a finite alphabet. Here we extend the notion of Parikh matrix of a word to a picture array and associate with it two kinds of Parikh matrices, called row Parikh matrix and column Parikh matrix. Two picture arrays A and B are defined to be M-equivalent if their row Parikh matrices are the same and their column Parikh matrices are the same. This enables to extend the notion of M-ambiguity to a picture array. In the binary and ternary cases, conditions that ensure M-ambiguity are then obtained. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Ambiguity; Parikh matrix; Picture array; Subword; Word","","","","","","","","Atanasiu A., Binary amiable words, Intern.

These shares are digitally or physically overlapped to recover the original image, negating the need for complex mathematical operations or additional hardware. There have been many variations of visual cryptography proposed over the years, each addressing different problems or to fulfill different security requirements. Existing review papers on the area only cover certain types of visual cryptography or lack comparisons between the various schemes. To address this gap, this paper provides broad overview of the area to aid new researchers in identifying research problems or to select suitable visual cryptography methods for their desired applications. For more veteran researchers in the area, our paper provides the most up-to-date coverage of the state-of-the-art. We first provide an introduction to the various categories of visual cryptography techniques, including a discussion on recently proposed schemes. These schemes are then compared in terms of their features, performance metrics, advantages and disadvantages. Compared to prior work, we extend the number of comparison metrics to include signal-to-noise ratio and the type of shares. Over 40 visual cryptography schemes that have been proposed in the past two decades were analyzed and compared. Our findings indicate that existing problems such as pixel expansion, poor quality of recovered image quality, computational and memory complexities still exist, and a optimizing the trade-off between these requirements still requires further investigation. We conclude the paper with a discussion of these open problems and future research directions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Confidentiality; Encryption; Information security; Pixel expansion; Secret sharing; Visual cryptography","Economic and social effects; Signal to noise ratio; Comparison metrics; Encryption technique; Future research directions; Mathematical operations; Performance metrics; Security requirements; Visual cryptography; Visual cryptography schemes; Cryptography","","","","","Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, KPM, (FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1)","This work is supported in part by the Ministry of Education (MOE) Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), project number FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1.

In order to evaluate this hypothesis, Laplacian image edge detection algorithm with convolution filtering is chosen as a case study. In this work, local memories of GPGPU are utilized in order to achieve the superlinear speedup. The convolution filtering kernels of the Laplacian edge detection algorithm are invoked in these local memories. By this, the low latency of the GPGPGU local memory are deployed efficiently and this subsequently leads to a higher speedup. The results obtained presented that the superlinear speedup is achieved when the size of the convolution kernel is large. In this study, when the convolution kernel size is 7×7, superlinear speedup is observed for image dataset of sizes between 1KB-2500KB. © 2021 IEEE.","Central Prcessing Unit (CPU); Convolution kernel; CUDA; General Purposes Graphic Processing Units (GPGPU); Graphics Processing Units (GPU); Laplacian image edge detection algorithm; Superlinear speedup","Convolution; Graphics processing unit; Laplace transforms; Program processors; Signal detection; Concurrent threads; Convolution filtering; Convolution kernel; Edge detection algorithms; Graphic processing units; Image edge detection; Laplacian algorithm; Superlinear speedups; Edge detection","","","","","","","Taniar D., Leung C.H.C., Rahayu W., Goel S., High Performance Parallel Database Processing and Grid Databases, (2008); Kumar V., Introduction to Parallel Computing, (2002); Amdahl G.M., Validity of the single processor approach to achieving large scale computing capabilities, Proceedings of the, pp. 483-485, (1967); Gustafson J.L., Reevaluating Amdahl's law, Commun ACM 31, 5, pp. 532-533, (1988); Shi Y., Reevaluating Amdahl's Law and Gustafson's Law; Vajda A., The Fundamental Laws of Parallelism Programming Many-Core Chips, pp. 77-88, (2011); Otte M., Correll N., C-FOREST Parallel shortest path planning with superlinear speedup, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 29, 3, pp. 798-806, (2013); Speckenmeyer E., Monien B., Vornberger O., Superlinear speedup for parallel backtracking, 1st International Conference on Supercomputing, pp. 985-993, (1988); Gustafson J.L., Fixed time, tiered memory, and superlinear speedup, Poceedings of the Fifth Distributed Memory Computing Conference(DMCC5, (1990); Kirk D.B., Hwu W.-M.W., Programming Massively Parallel Processor S: A Hands-on Approach Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc, 1, (2010); Jason S., Kandrot E., CUDA by Example An introduction to general-purpose gpu programming, Portable Documents, (2010); Oskoei M.A., Hu H., A survey on edge detection methods, Technical Report: CES-506; Chen X., Qiu Y., Yi H., Implementation and performance of image filtering on gpu, Fourth International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing (ICGIP), pp. 514-517, (2013); Luo Y., Duraiswami R., Canny edge detection on nvidia cuda, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops 2008, CVPRW?08 IEEE Computer Society Conference on; Gong H.X., Hao L., Roberts edge detection algorithm based on GPU, Journal of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research, 6, 7, pp. 1308-1314, (2014); Niu S., Yang J., Wang S., Chen G., Improvement and parallel implementation of canny edge detection algorithm based on gpu, ASIC(ASICon IEEE 9th International Conference on, (2011); Huang Y., Bai Y., Li R., Huang X., Research of Canny edge detection algorithm on embedded CPU and GPU heterogenous systems, Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery(ICNCFSKD), 12th International Conference on, pp. 647-651, (2016); Almazrooie M., Abdullah R., Yi Y.L., Venkat I., Adnan Z., Parallel laplacian fliter using cuda on gpgpu, International Conference on Information Technology and Multimedia (ICIMU), pp. 60-65, (2014); Afifi M., Atri M., Said Y., Efficient 2d convolution filters implementation on graphics processing unit using nvidia cuda, International Journal of Image, Graphics and Signal Processing, pp. 1-8, (2018); Martin D., Fowlkes C., Tal D., Malik J., A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2, pp. 416-423, (2001)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","6th International Conference on Computer and Information Sciences, ICCOINS 2021","13 July 2021 through 15 July 2021","Kuching","170762","","978-172817151-7","","","English","Proc. - Int.

It is a meta-heuristic optimization search algorithm inspired from the intelligent foraging behavior of the honey bees in nature. Its unique search process made it as one of the most competitive algorithm with some other search algorithms in the area of optimization, such as Genetic algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). However, the ABC performance of the local search process and the bee movement or the solution improvement equation still has some weaknesses. The ABC is good in avoiding trapping at the local optimum but it spends its time searching around unpromising random selected solutions. Inspired by the PSO, we propose a Hybrid Particle-movement ABC algorithm called HPABC, which adapts the particle movement process to improve the exploration of the original ABC algorithm. Numerical benchmark functions were used in order to experimentally test the HPABC algorithm. The results illustrate that the HPABC algorithm can outperform the ABC algorithm in most of the experiments (75% better in accuracy and over 3 times faster). © 2015 The Authors.","Artificial bee colony algorithm; Numerical function optimization; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm intelligence algorithms","","","","","","","","Karaboga D., Basturk B., Appl.

Making smart data-driven decisions will help the organizations to ride the waves toward invaluable investments. The successful implementation of Big Data projects depends on their alignment with the current organizational, technological, and analytical aspects. Identifying the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for Big Data is fundamental to overcome the challenges surrounding Big Data Analytics (BDA) and implementation. In recent years, the investigations related to identifying the CSFs of Big Data and Big Data Analytics expanded on a large scale trying to address the limitations in existing publications and contribute to the body of knowledge. This paper aims to provide more understanding about the existing CSFs for Big Data Analytics and implementation and contributes to the body of knowledge by answering three research questions: 1) How many studies have investigated on Big Data CSFs for analytics and implementation?, 2) What are the existing CSFs for Big Data Analytics, and 3) What are the categories of Big Data Analytics CSFs?. By conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for the available studies related to Big Data CSFs in the last twelve years (2007-2019), a final list of sixteen (16) related articles was extracted and analyzed to identify the Big Data Analytics CSFs and their categories. Based on the descriptive qualitative content analysis method for the selected literature, this SLR paper identifies 74 CSFs for Big Data and proposes a classification schema and framework in terms of 5 categories, namely Organization, Technology, People, Data Management, and Governance. The findings of this paper could be used as a referential framework for a successful strategy and implementation of Big Data by formulating more effective data-driven decisions. Future work will investigate the priority of the Big Data CSFs and their categories toward developing a conceptual framework for assessing the success of Big Data projects.  © 2013 IEEE.","Big data (BD); big data analytics (BDA); big data challenges; big data implementation; critical success factors (CSFs); information system success; maturity; readiness; systematic literature review (SLR)","Big data; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Information management; Metadata; Conceptual frameworks; Content analysis method; Critical success factor; Data driven decision; Digital transformation; Research questions; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Advanced Analytics","","","","","","","Jin X., Wah B.W., Cheng X., Wang Y., Significance and challenges of big data research, Big Data Res., 2, 2, pp. 59-64, (2015); Tsai C.-W., Lai C.-F., Chao H.-C., Vasilakos A.V., Big data analytics: A survey, J.

With all the availability of the wearable devices fully embedded with sensors that are being used for human health monitoring, a lot of techniques are been proposed and used in the process. However, most of the publicly available datasets in use today, are collected in a fully controlled or semi-natural settings. Also, elderly peoples from rural areas and transitional activities are mostly not considered, which will cause a lack of generalization of the dreamed HAR models. The purpose of this research is to collect a new dataset from elderly peoples in a rural area and find the best sensor position among ankle and waist by subjecting the newly collected datasets to different machine learning classifiers. Sliding window technique with 50% overlapping was used to segment the sensor data collected from the elderly subjects. Relevant features were extracted, and selected using the wrapper method. From the results obtained, it has shown that the sensor attached at the waist position yield a better result compared to the ankle position on the newly collected elderly data. KNN algorithm has the highest accuracy level in both cases compared to the remaining tested classifiers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Elderly; Human-activity-recognition; Sensor and position; Waist","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6315206)","Acknowledgment.

The global feature information is obtained from clustering the image in its feature space using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering. The over-segmented regions produced by performing watershed on the gradient of the image are then mapped to this global information in the feature space. Further to this, the global feature information is optimized using Simulated Annealing (SA). The optimal global feature information is used to derive the similarity criterion to merge the over-segmented watershed regions which are represented by the region adjacency graph (RAG). The proposed method has been tested on digital brain phantom simulated dataset to segment white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soft tissues regions. The experiments showed that the proposed method performs statistically better, with average of 95.242% regions are merged, than the immersion watershed and average accuracy improvement of 8.850% in comparison with RAG-based immersion watershed merging using global and local features. © 2015 SPIE.","Fuzzy C-Means; Immersion watershed; Region adjacency graph; Region merging; Simulated annealing","Cerebrospinal fluid; Fuzzy systems; Graphic methods; Image processing; Merging; Simulated annealing; Watersheds; Accuracy Improvement; Cerebro spinal fluids; Fuzzy C mean; Fuzzy C means clustering; Global informations; Region adjacency graphs; Region-merging; Similarity criteria; Image segmentation","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, MOHE; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (1001/PKOMP/817067)","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) of Image Segmentation Using Hybrid Fuzzy C-Means Clustering and Watershed Regions-Based Segmentation Algorithms on General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (203/PKOMP/6711425) by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia and the grant of Spatially Aware Clustering Models for Multispectral Image Segmentation (1001/PKOMP/817067).

However, it is considered as one of the most difficult NP-hard problems, which means that no polynomial-time algorithm is known to solve this intractable problem effectively. Even small instances of QAP may require vast computation time. In this work, a uniform cellular solution to QAP is proposed in the framework of membrane computing by using a family of recognizer tissue P systems with cell division. In the design of the solution, we encode the given instances in binary notations.

In this paper, we suggest a costeffective and presumably a faster processing technique by utilizing a heterogeneous distributed system composed of a set of commodity computers connected by a local area network. Neural network computations can be viewed as a set of matrix multiplication processes. These can be adapted to utilize the existing matrix multiplication algorithms tailored for such systems. With Java technology as an implementation means, we discuss the different factors that should be considered in order to achieve this goal highlighting some issues that might affect such a proposed implementation. © 2009 IEEE.","","Communication systems; Neural networks; Feed-Forward; Heterogeneous distributed systems; Java technologies; MAtrix multiplication; Matrix multiplication algorithm; Processing technique; Processing Time; Time and space; Work in progress; Local area networks","","","","","","","Moerland P., Fiesler E., Beale R., Neural Network Adaptations To Hardware Implementations, Handbook of Neural Computation, (1997); Duren R.W., Marks II R.J., Reynolds P.D., Real- Time Neural Network Inversion on the SRC-6e Reconfigurable Computer, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS, 18, pp. 889-901, (2007); Bochev V., Distributed Arithmetic Implementation of Artificial Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 41, pp. 2010-2013, (1993); Mathia K., Clark J., On neural network hardware and programming paradigms, Proceedings of the 2002 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN '02), 3, pp. 2692-2697, (2002); Chronopoulos A.T., Sarangapani J., A distributed discrete-time neural network architecture for pattern allocation and control, Proceedings of the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS'02), pp. 204-211, (2002); Dahl G., McAvinney A., Newhall T., Parallelizing Neural Network Training for Cluster Systems, The IASTED International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing and Networks (PDCN 2008), (2008); Jeng C.-C., Yang I.-C., Practical Implementation of Back-Propagation Networks in a Low-Cost PC Cluster, Neural Information Processing, 4, pp. 33-37, (2004); Novokhodko A., Valentine S., A Parallel Implementation of the Batch Backpropagation Training of Neural Networks, International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN'01), pp. 1783-1786, (2001); Soliman M.I., Mohamed S.A., A highly efficient implementation of a backpropagation learning algorithm using matrix ISA, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 68, pp. 949-961, (2008); Dongarra J., Pineau J.-F., Robert Y., Vivien F., Matrix product on heterogeneous master-worker platforms, Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming, pp. 53-62, (2008); Lastovetsky A., On Grid-based Matrix Partitioning for Heterogeneous Processors, Sixth International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC'07), (2007); Al-Jaroodi J., Mohamed N., Jiang H., Swanson D., Modeling parallel applications performance on heterogeneous systems, Proceedings of the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS'03), (2003); Beaumont O., Boudet V., Matrix Multiplication on Heterogeneous Platforms, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, 12, pp. 1033-1051, (2001); Ohshima S., Kise K., Katagiri T., Yuba T., Parallel Processing of Matrix Multiplication in a CPU and GPU Heterogeneous Environment, 7th International Meeting on High Performance Computing for Computational Science (VECPAR'06), pp. 305-318, (2006); Pelrez J.M., Sanchez L.M., Garcila F., Calderoln A., Carretero J., High performance Java input/output for heterogeneous distributed computing, Proceedings of the 10th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC 2005), pp. 969-974, (2005); Matsuoka S., Itou S., Towards Performance Evaluation of High-Performance Computing on Multiple Java Platforms, Future Generation Computer Systems, 18, pp. 281-291, (2001); Randall Wilson D., Martinez T.R., The general inefficiency of batch training for gradient descent learning, Neural Networks, 16, pp. 1429-1451, (2003); Dongarra J.J., Wade R., McMahan P., Linpack Benchmark - Java; Yoo R.M., Lee H.-H.S., Lee H., Chow K., Hierarchical Means: Single Number Benchmarking with Workload Cluster Analysis, IEEE 10th International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC 2007), pp. 204-213, (2007); Boyer B., Robust Java benchmarking, IBM, developerWorks, (2008); LeCun Y., Cortes C., The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits, (1998)","A.

For any raw data being input to a procedure, the researcher will first extract the required features from the raw data. These features must be embodied into a meaningful representation to be inserted in the procedure. This paper will discuss the data representation called reference frame used in geometric hashing algorithm for protein structure matching. Matching 3D structure needs special care so that the important and unique information can be encapsulated and differentiated between one another. The reference frame is generated from backbone fragment i.e. N-Calpha;-C. This paper will first show the calculation of the reference frame RF1 and second, given a single coordinate for atom S (x,y,z), we want to find new coordinate for S (x̂, ŷ, ẑ) in terms of the reference frame RF1. These new coordinates will be used as the matching features between two structures.

The Parikh matrix provides more numerical information about a word than given by the Parikh vector. Here we introduce the notion of M-vector of a binary word which allows us to have a linear notation in the form of a unique vector representation of the Parikh matrix of the binary word. We then extend this notion of M-vector to a binary image treating it as a binary array over a two-symbol alphabet. This is done by considering the M-vectors of the words in the rows and columns of the array. Among the properties associated with a Parikh matrix, M-ambiguity or simply ambiguity of a word is one which has been investigated extensively in the literature. Here M-ambiguity of a binary array is defined in terms of its M-vector and we obtain conditions for M-ambiguity of a binary array. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Binary images; Image analysis; Binary arrays; Binary words; Numerical information; Parikh matrix; Parikh vectors; Vector representations; Vectors","","","","","","","Atanasiu A., Binary amiable words, Intern.

Many tools are being developed to make use of these resources. The ever-evolving cloud environment has a very rich pool of resources with one of the significant yet to be used is the memory in idle workstations. This paper, provide the reasons why the idle network memory should be utilized. Some comparative studies were done on other applications that have successfully utilized the idle network memory. Then we provide a design methodology that proves the significant of utilizing this memory. The following questions were answered. First, how would an idle workstation been chosen from the list maintained by a server? Second, how many types of clients are supported by the tool? Third, what happen when the clients suddenly turn busy again when they are hosting guest data? Fourth, in which time interval that most of the machines in the network are expected to be idle? Finally, we justify the objectives by using our collected data. The main aim is to indicate the best time the network memory can be recruited for hosting guest data and establish the usage of idle network memory is worth the effort. Finally, we tested the decision making part of the server using different scenarios and the server seems to respond accordingly in monitoring the network memory. © 2011 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Idle network memory; Memory virtualization; Remote memory","Cluster computing; Hierarchical systems; Open systems; Virtual reality; Comparative studies; Computing environments; Design Methodology; General trends; Idle network memory; Memory virtualization; Networking technology; Other applications; Performance improvements; Remote memory; Time interval; Cloud computing","","","","","","","Acharya A., Setia S., Availability and Utility of Idle Memory in Workstation Clusters, (1998); Kousshi S., Acharya A., Setia S., Dodo: A User-level System for Exploiting Idle Memory in Workstation Clusters, (1998); Anderson E., Neefe J.M., An Exploration of Network Ram, (1994); Xiao L., Zhang X., Kubricht S.A., Incorporating Job Migration and Network RAM to Share Cluster Memory Resources, Proceedings of the 9th IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC-9), August 2000, pp. 71-78; Acharya A., Setia S., The utility of exploiting idle memory for data-intensive computations, ACM SIGMETRICS '98, 1998; Ioannidis S., Markatos E.P., Sevaslidou J., On Using Network Memory to Improve the Performance of Transaction-based System; Flouris M.D., Markatos E.P., Network RAM, High Performance Cluster Computing, 1, pp. 383-508, (1999); Flouris M.D., Markatos E.P., Work - in - Progress Session of the USENIX '99 Annual Technical Conference, June 6-11 1999, Monterey, CA, USA; Dahlin M., Wang R., Anderson T., Patterson D., Cooperative Caching: Using Remote Memory to Improve File System Performance,  Symposium on Operating System Design and Implementation, Nov 1994, pp. 267-280; Waldspurger C.A., Memory Resource Management in VMware ESX Server,  Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI '02), (2002); Feeley M.J., Global Memory Management for Workstation Networks, (1996); Markatos E.P., Dramitinos G., Implementation of reliable remote memory pager, Proceedings of the 1996 Usenix Technical Conference, pp. 146-164, (1996); Buyya R., High Performance Cluster Computing: Architectures and Systems, 1, (1999); Waldspurger C.A., Memory Resource Management in VMware ESX Server, Proceedings of the 5th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI '02), (2002); Cuenca-Acuna F.M., Nguyen T.D., Cooperative Caching Middleware for Cluster-Based Servers,  IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC-10), 2001; Balaji P., Shah H.V., Panda D.K., Sockets vs RDMA interface over 10-Gigabit networks: An in-depth analysis of the memory traffic bottleneck, RAIT Workshop'04; Chandara S.N., Subramaniam R.K., PC-Cluster: An extensive study on the trend and direction in a decade of research and development, Proceeding of Advance Technology Congress, Conference on Advances in Theoretical Sciences, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, May 2003; Chandara S.N., Subramaniam R.K., Idle Memory Harvesting and Management Techniques in Local Area Network for better Performance, Proceeding of International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Processing Techniques and Applications (PDPTA'03), Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, June 2003; Chandara S.N., Subramaniam R.K., Idle Memory Utilization and Management on Local Area Network Using Cluster Technology, Proceeding of Advance Technology Congress, Conference on Advances in Theoretical Sciences, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, May 2003; Hoff T., Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the next Big Thing?, (2009); Ghalimi I.C., Cloud Computing Is Memory Bound, (2010); Perez-Conde C., Diaz-Villanueva W., Emerging Information Tecnologies (II): Virtualization as Support for SOA and Cloud Computing, The European Journal of the Informatics Professional (CEPIS UPGRADE), 11, 4, pp. 30-35, (2010); Hansen J.S., Lachaize R., Using Idle Disks in A Cluster As A High Performance Storage System, (2002); Hulen H., Graf O., Fitzgerald K., Watson R.W., Storage Area Networks and the High Performance Storage System, pp. 225-240, (2002); Balaji P., Shah H.V., Panda D.K., Sockets vs RDMA interface over 10-Gigabit networks: An in-depth analysis of the memory traffic bottleneck, RAIT Workshop'04; Mamidala A., Vishnu A., Efficient shared memory and RDMA based design for mpi-allgather over InfiniBand, Recent Advances in Parallel Virtual Machine and Message Passing Interface, (2006); Weikuan Y., Et al., Performance of RDMA-capable Storage Protocols onWide-Area Network, Petascale Data Storage Workshop, 2008.

GA offers a stochastic global optimization technique that might suffer from two major shortcomings: slow convergence time and impractical data representation. The effect of these shortcomings is more considerable in case of larger FFANN with larger dataset. Using a non-binary real-coded data representation we offer an enhancement to the generational GA used for the training of FFANN. Such enhancement would come in two fold: The first being a new strategy to process the strings of the population by allowing the fittest string to survive unchanged to the next population depending on its age. The second is to speed up fitness computation time through the utilization of known parallel processing techniques used for matrix multiplication. The implementation was carried on master-slaves architecture of commodity computers connected via Ethernet. Using a well-known benchmarking dataset, results show that our proposed technique is superior to the standard in terms of both the overall convergence time and processing time. © 2010 IEEE.","Genetic algorithms; Matrix-multiplication; Neural network; Parallel processing","Computer architecture; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Intelligent systems; Matrix algebra; Convergence time; Data representations; Data sets; Feed-forward artificial neural networks; Fitness computation; matrix; Matrix-multiplication; New strategy; Non-binary; Parallel genetic algorithms; Parallel processing; Processing Time; Real-coded; Speed-ups; Stochastic global optimization; Neural networks","","","","","","","Zhang Y., Wu L., Weights Optimization of Neural Networks via Improved BCO Approach, Progress in Electromagnetics Research, 83, pp. 185-198, (2008); Skutova J., Weights Initialization Methods for MLP Neural Networks, Transactions of the VŠB, 54, pp. 147-152, (2008); Gupta J.N.D., Sexton R.S., Comparing backpropagation with a genetic algorithm for neural network training, Omega, The International Journal of Management Science, 27, pp. 679-684, (1999); Eiben A.E., Smith J.E., Introduction to Evolutionary Computing, (2008); Kim D., Kim H., Chung D., A modified genetic algorithm for fast training neural networks, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3496, I, pp. 660-665, (2005); Alba E., Chicano J.F., Training neural networks with GA hybrid algorithms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 3102, pp. 852-863, (2004); Wei G., Study on Evolutionary Neural Network Based on Ant Colony Optimization, International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security Workshops Harbin, Heilongjiang, China, 2007, pp. 3-6; Hamey L.G.C., XOR Has No Local Minima: A Case Study in Neural Network Error Surface Analysis, Neural Networks, 11, pp. 669-681, (1998); Hassoun M.H., Fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks, (1995); Siddique M.N.H., Tokhi M.O., Training neural networks: Backpropagation vs. genetic algorithms, International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN '01), Washington, DC 2001, pp. 2673-2678; Fish K.E., Johnson J.D., Dorsey R.E., Blodgett J.G., Using an artificial neural network trained with a genetic algorithm to model brand share, Journal of Business Research, 57, 1, pp. 79-85, (2004); Vinod A.V., Kumar K.A., Reddy G.V., Simulation of biodegradation process in a fluidized bed bioreactor using genetic algorithm trained feed forward neural network, Biochemical Engineering Journal, 46, pp. 12-20, (2009); Shengjun X., Shaoyong G., Dongling B., The Analysis and Research of Parallel Genetic Algorithm, 4th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing Dalian, China: IEEE, 2008, pp. 1-4; Soliman M.I., Mohamed S.A., A highly efficient implementation of a backpropagation learning algorithm using matrix ISA, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 68, pp. 949-961, (2008); Hunold S., Rauber T., Runger G., Combining building blocks for parallel multi-level matrix multiplications, Parallel Computing, 34, pp. 411-426, (2008); Tsilikas G., Fleury M., Matrix Multiplication Performance on Commodity Shared-Memory Multiprocessors, Proceedings of the International Conference on Parallel Computing in Electrical Engineering (PARELEC'04), 2004, pp. 13-18; Ohtaki Y., Takahashi D., Boku T., Sato M., Parallel implementation of Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm for heterogeneous clusters, Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, 2004.

They can only perform their functions when they fold into their tertiary structure. Protein structure can be determined experimentally and computationally. Experimental methods are time consuming and high-priced and it is not always feasible to identify the protein structure experimentally. In order to predict the protein structure using computational methods, the problem is formulated as an optimization problem and the goal is to find the lowest free energy conformation. In this paper, Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) is a swarm intelligence based optimization algorithm inspired by the behaviour of honey bee foraging. This algorithm is adapted to search the protein conformational search space to find the lowest free energy conformation. Interestingly, the algorithm was able to find the lowest free energy conformation for a test protein (i.e. Met enkephaline) using ECEPP/2 force fields. © 2009 IEEE.","","Cellular automata; Free energy; Biological process; Colony algorithms; Conformational search; Experimental methods; Force fields; Honey bee; Human bodies; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Protein structures; Protein tertiary structure prediction; Swarm Intelligence; Tertiary structures; Algorithms","","","","","","","Chiu T.-L., Goldstein R., Optimizing energy potentials for success in protein tertiary structure prediction, Folding and Design, 3, 3, pp. 223-228, (1998); Zhang H., Protein Tertiary Structures: Prediction from Amino Acid Sequences, Encyclopedia of Life Sciences, (2002); Schulze-Kremer S., Genetic Algorithms and Protein Folding, Protein Structure Prediction Methods and Protocols, pp. 175-222, (2000); Zhou Y., Abagyan R., Efficient Stochastic Global Optimization for Protein Structure Prediction, Rigidity Theory and Applications, pp. 345-356, (2002); Yang X.-S., Engineering Optimizations via Nature-Inspired Virtual Bee Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering Applications: A Bioinspired Approach, pp. 317-323, (2005); Lucic P., Modelling Transportation Problems Using Concepts of Swarm Intelligence and Soft Computing, Faculty of the Virginia Polytechnic Instisute and State University, (2002); Hyeong Soo C., Converging Marriage in Honey-Bees Optimization and Application to Stochastic Dynamic Programming, Journal of Global Optimization, 35, 3, pp. 423-441, (2006); Karaboga D., An Idea Based On Honey Bee Swarm For Numerical Optimization, in Technical Report-TR06, (2005); Abbass H.A., MBO: Marriage in Honey Bees Optimization -A Haplometrosis Polygynous Swarming Approach, Congress on Evolutionary Computation, (2001); Dietz A., Bee Genetics and Breeding, Evolution, (1986); Pham D.T., Et al., The Bees Algorithm, A Novel Tool for Coplex Optimisation Problems, 2nd International Virtual Conference on Intelligent Production Machines and Systems (IPROMS 2006), (2006); Seeley T.D., The Wisdom of the Hive The Social Physiology of Honey Bee Colonies, (1995); Karaboga D., Basturk B., A powerful and efficient algorithm for numerical function optimization: Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, Journal of Global Optimization, 39, 3, pp. 459-471, (2007); Karaboga D., Basturk B., Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Optimization Algorithm for Solving Constrained Optimization Problems, Foundations of Fuzzy Logic and Soft Computing, pp. 789-798, (2007); Karaboga D., Akay B., Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm on Training Artificial Neural Networks, Signal Processing and Communications Applications, 2007.

New inventions in the transmission medium such as DWDM, SDH and GigaEthernet increase bandwidth capacity of the network. Meanwhile, more network-oriented applications are becoming popular. All these require faster and programmable packet processing capabilities in the inter-connecting network nodes. Packet processing technology of network equipment is seeing a migration from ASIC solutions to NP. In this paper, we review the latest technology of NP, which has been designed today for next generation networks. NP has to adapt to rapid protocol standards change and perform at wire speed like ASIC solutions, using considerably easier programmable NPs besides maintaining short time-to-market and time-in-market which is essential to meet tomorrow's network demand. This paper discusses the trend in NP architecture, packet processing classification functions and the challenges ahead for the network processors architecture. The authors feel this is the first survey paper on NP.","Address lookup; Network processor; Packet processing; Parallel processing; Programming element","","","","","","","","Ettikan K., Abdullah R., High Speed Packet Processing Challenges for Network Processors, Proceedings, M2USIC (MMU International Symposium on Information and Communications Technologies), 2-3, (2003); Wolf T., Turner J.S., Design Issues for High-Performance Active Routers, Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal, 19, pp. 404-409, (2001); Karim F., Nguyen A., Dev S., Rao R., On-Chip Communication Architecture for OC-768 Network Processors, Design Automation Conference Proceedings, pp. 678-683, (2001); Paulin P.G., Karim F., Bromley P., Network Processor: A Perspective on Market Requirements, Processor Architecture and Embedded S/W Tools, Design, Automation and Test in Europe, 2001, Conference and Exhibition Proceedings, pp. 420-427, (2001); (2002); Alexander P., Application of Programmable Multithreaded Network Processor Architecture to OC-192 Packet Forwarding, (2002); (2002); (2002); Systems A., The Challenge for Next Generation Network Processors; (2002); (2002); (2002); (2002); (2002); Araujo G., Malik S., Optimal Code Generation for Embedded Memory Non-Homogeneous Register Architectures, Proc. 8th Int.

This paper introduces a parallel algorithm for Hashing-N-Gram-Hirschberg (HNGH) algorithm. The HNGH algorithm is an extension of N-Gram-Hirschberg (NGH) algorithm which was proposed by Abdul Rashid in 2007. The parallel algorithm is proposed to speed up the sequential HNGH when run on large database. Our parallel algorithm has two levels of parallelization, one on processors level and the other one on the cores level. By testingour previous work with different Gram lengths ranges from 3-6 letters, HNGH algorithm outperforms the former algorithm (NGH algorithm) in most cases. The parallel algorithm shows an enhancement in the execution time but the speed up is a bit low because of the high communication among processers and the high dependency among the tasks. © 2010 IEEE.","Component; Dynamic programming; Parallel computing; Protein sequence comparison; Protein sequence similarity; Sequence alignment","Alignment; Parallel algorithms; Parallel architectures; Proteins; Component; Parallel Computing; Protein sequence comparison; Protein sequence similarity; Sequence alignments; Dynamic programming","","","","","","","Lipman D.J., Pearson W.R., Rapid and sinsitive protein similarity searches, Sceince, 227, pp. 1435-1441, (1985); Wilbur W.J., Lipman D.J., Rapid similarity searches in nucleic acid and protein databanks, Proc.

Integrating all the information from different databases into one database is a challenging problem. Our main research is to develop a tool which can be used to access and manipulate protein information from difference databases. In our approach, we have integrated difference databases such as Swiss-prot, PDB, Interpro, and EMBL and transformed these databases in flat file format into relational form using XML and Bioperl. As a result, we showed this tool can search different sizes of protein information stored in relational database and the result can be retrieved faster compared to flat file database. A web based user interface is provided to allow user to access or search for protein information in the local database.

RNA structures determination have become a major problem in the biology context. Recently, computer scientists have empowered the biologists with RNA secondary structures that ease an understanding of the RNA functions and roles. Detecting RNA secondary structure is an NP-hard problem, especially in pseudoknotted RNA structures. The detection process is also time-consuming; as a result, an alternative approach such as using parallel architectures is a desirable option. The main goal in this paper is to do an intensive investigation of parallel methods used in the literature to solve the demanding issues, related to the RNA secondary structure prediction methods.

The parallel Fuzzy C - Means (FCM) cluster analysis algorithm is composed by two distinct parts. The two distinct parts are; first: the cluster analysis whereby using the FCM algorithm to calculate the cluster centers and second: the evaluation of the subset of clusters whereby using the cluster validity functions to produce the result of the optimal cluster.

This challenge is related to the fact that the traditional computational methods are not powerful enough to search for the correct structure in the huge conformational space. This inadequate capability of the computational methods, however, is a major obstacle in facing this problem. Trying to solve the problem of the protein fold recognition, most of the researchers have examined the use of the protein threading technique. This problem is known as NP-hard; researchers have used various methods such as neural networks, Monte Carlo, support vector machine and genetic algorithms to solve it. Some researchers tried the use of the parallel evolutionary methods for protein fold recognition but it is less well known. Approach: We reviewed various algorithms that have been developed for protein structure prediction by threading and fold recognition. Moreover, we provided a survey of parallel evolutionary methods for protein fold recognition. Results: The findings of this survey showed that evolutionary methods can be used to resolve the protein fold recognition problem. Conclusion: There are two aspects of protein fold recognition problem: First is the computational difficulty and second is that current energy functions are still not accurate enough to calculate the free energy of a given conformation. © 2008 Science Publications.","Evolutionary methods; Parallel evolutionary methods; Protein fold recognition; Protein threading","","","","","","","","Akutsu T., Miyano S., On the approximation of protein threading, Theoret.

Our contribution to this case study aims at illustrating the methodology associated with the concept of shared state model and events for describing and specifying synchronised controllers. We use the notion of state to describe and model the sensors and actuators. Next, we apply the leads-to operator to list the assumptions which are aspects of the behaviour of the plant that can not be controlled by the controllers. We then show how one can specify each controller using leads-to and state notation as shared variables for synchronising the interaction of the controllers. Specification are structured modularly according to the physical structure of the system.","Concurrent controllers; Duration calculus; Formal method; Production cell","","","","","","","","Hansen M.R., Chouchen Z., Duration Calculus: Logical Foundation, Formal Aspects of Computing, (1997); Ravn A.P., Design of Embedded Real-Time Computing System, Thesis Denmark Technical University, (1995); The Raise Specification Language, (1992); Leverentz C., Linder T., Case Study Production Cell, A Comparative Study in Formal Software Development; Austin S., Parkin F.I., Formal Methods: A Survey, Technical Report, (1993); Broy M., Jahnichen S., Korrekte Software Durch Formale Methoden, (1993); Chouchen Z., Ravn A.P., Hansen M.R., An Extended Duration Calculus for Hybrid Real-Time Systems, (1993)","R.M.

The above three points are considered in the implementation of Bipartite Graph Matching with Reference Frame algorithm (BGMRF). In BGMRF, the tertiary structures of protein Cα backbone are defined in reference frames representation. The matching vectors generated from the reference frames are integrated into bipartite graph as a representation to do the matching of structures. From bipartite graph, the problem is reduced to a network flow graph. The matching is solved using Ford-Fulkerson algorithm with Breadth First Search algorithm to find maximum weight matching. The experiment to identify Crambin-like family from dataset of small proteins shows that reference frames representation is well adapted to graph-based matching technique in BGMRF. For a dataset of 266 small proteins, BGMRF has successfully identified all 12 Crambin-like family members in the dataset. © 2010 IEEE.","Bipartite graph; Protein backbone; Protein structure matching; Reference frame","Algorithms; Feature extraction; Pattern matching; Proteins; Bi-Partite graph matching; Bipartite graphs; Breadth first search algorithms; Data representations; Data sets; Graph-based; Matching algorithm; Matching techniques; Network flows; Protein backbone; Protein structure matching; Protein structures; Protein tertiary structures; Reference frame; Similarity measure; Tertiary structures; Graph theory","","","","","","","Gao F., Zaki M.J., Indexing protein structures using suffix trees, Protein Structure Prediction, pp. 147-169, (2008); Wu Z., Wang Y., Chen L., Feng E., Assessing distance measures for protein structure comparison,  Intl.

Anycasting is a new mechanism introduced recently for IP packet delivery from a sending node to any one of a group of receiving nodes with the same IP addresses. Any one and only one node from the group will reply to the sender. The birth of IPv6 has enabled service locating using anycasting method, which was not possible in IPv4. Generally packets are routed by static or dynamic routing method. Packets can be routed by using single path routing (SPR), multiple path routing (MPR) or integrated routing (SPR&MPR) techniques. In this paper we have implemented and analyzed single path routing tree algorithms with two routing strategies: static and semi-dynamic. Bellman ford algorithm was used to develop our new semi-dynamic anycast routing mechanisms. Routing tree formation (RTF) protocol that we implemented includes anycast group based shortest path first (AGBSPF) algorithm, load-balanced AGBSPF algorithm, load propagation algorithm for server load announcement and core-based tree (CBT). Besides we have also implemented packet forwarding (PF) algorithms to perform well with the RTF where it helps to forward the packets based on the costs and server load. Semi-dynamic method has proved to be better then the static where it provides alternative path for packets transmission in the case of link or node down. © 2003 IEEE.","Algorithm design and analysis; Communication networks; Computer networks; Internet; IP networks; Multicast algorithms; Network servers; Routing protocols; Telecommunication network reliability; Web server","Algorithms; Computer networks; Dynamics; Forestry; Internet; Internet protocols; Multicasting; Network layers; Network routing; Reliability analysis; Routers; Routing protocols; Servers; Telecommunication networks; Trees (mathematics); Algorithm design and analysis; IP networks; Multicast algorithms; Network server; Web servers; Dynamic routing algorithms","","","","","","","Ettikan K., Abdullah R., An Analysis Of Anycast Architecture, IASTED International Conference Communications and Computer Networks (CCN 2002), November 4-6, 2002,USA; Oe M., YamaGuchi S., Implementation and Evaluation of IPv6 Anycast, (1999); Partridge C., Mendez T., Milliken W., Host Anycasting Service, (1993); Metz C., IP Anycast, Point-to- (Any) Point Communication, (2002); Ettikan K., An Analysis of Anycast Architecture and Transport Layer Problems, APRICOT 2001, (2001); Ettikan K., Ganapathy V., IPv6 Performance Analysis on FreeBSD Workstations Using Simple Applications, (2000); Jia W., Xuan D., Zhao W., Integrated Routing Algorithms for Anycast Messages, (1998); Xuan D., Jia W., Routing Algorithms For Anycast Messages, (1998); Jia W., Xuan D., Zhao W., Integrated Routing Algortihms for Anycast Messages, (2002); Ettikan K., Abdullah R., SLINA: Fault Tolerant and Load Balanced Global IPv6 Anycasting for Service Locating, Deploying IPv6 Networks, (2002); Diot C., Dabbous W., Crowcroft J., Multipoint Communication; A Survey of Protocols, Functions and Mechanisms, (2001); Stallings W.,  Edition, (2002); Ganguly A., Lassila P., A Study of TCP-RED Congestion Control Using ns2, (2001); Franciosa P., Frigioni D., Giaccio R., Semi-dynamic shortest paths and breadth-first search in digraph,  Annu.

The primary problem of meta-scheduling is selecting the best resources (sites) to use to execute the underlying jobs while still achieving the following objectives: reducing the mean job turnaround time, ensuring site load balance, and considering job priorities. We introduce an enhanced meta-scheduling system, called Job Nature Meta-scheduling over Grid (JNMgrid), that achieves these objectives. JNMgrid consists of three components: (1) Job Analyzer and Monitor, which is responsible for determining the types of jobs in specific ratios; (2) Job Decider, which is responsible for matching the jobs with the appropriate resources; and (3) Job Batcher, which is responsible for determining the best number of jobs for execution. The performance of JNMgrid is compared with similar existing systems, such as Random, Queue Length, File Access Cost, and File Access Cost + Job Queue Access Cost. The simulation results demonstrate that JNMgrid outperforms these systems and can thus be deployed in any grid middleware to improve sharing of limited resources among grid users. © Springer-Verlag 2011.","Grid site selection;

The existing computational methods are not powerful enough to search for the precise structure in a huge conformational space. This inadequate capability of the computational methods, however, is a major obstacle when trying to tackle this problem. The observations of some previous studies have revealed much interest in hybridizing a local search-based metahuristic algorithm within the population-based metahuristic algorithm. This study introduces a hybrid harmony search algorithm (HHSA) as a means to solve ab initio protein tertiary structure prediction problem. In HHSA, the iterated local search (ILS) is incorporated with the harmony search algorithm (HSA) to empower it so as to find the local optimal solution within the search space of the new harmony. Furthermore, the global-best concept of particle swarm optimization (PSO) is incorporated in memory consideration as a selection scheme to accelerate the convergence speed. The HHSA predicts the tertiary structure of a protein giving its sequence alone (i. e., from scratch). Our algorithm converges faster than the classical harmony search algorithm. We evaluate our algorithm using two protein sequences. The results show that our algorithm can find more precise solutions than other previous studies. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","ab initio protein structure prediction; Harmony search; Local search; Metaheuristic algorithms; Optimisation; Protein folding","metenkephalin; polypeptide; protein; ab initio calculation; algorithm; amino acid sequence; article; comparative study; energy; experimental design; hybrid harmony search algorithm; iterated local search; priority journal; process optimization; protein tertiary structure; quality control; search engine; sequence analysis","","metenkephalin, 58569-55-4; protein, 67254-75-5","","","","","Abagyan R., Maiorov V., A simple qualitative representation of polypeptide chain folds: comparison of protein tertiary structures, J Biomol Struct Dyn, 5, 6, pp. 1267-1279, (1988); Abual-Rub M., Abdullah R., A survey of protein fold recognition algorithms, J Comput Sci, 4, 9, pp. 768-776, (2008); Al-Betar M., Khader A.T., A harmony search algorithm for university course timetabling, Ann Oper Res, 194, 1, pp. 3-31, (2012); Al-Betar M.A., Khader A.T., Liao I.Y., A harmony search algorithm with multi-pitch adjusting rate for university course timetabling, Recent Advances In Harmony Search Algorithm, SCI, 270, pp. 147-162, (2010); Al-Betar M.A., Khader A.T., Nadi F., Selection mechanisms in memory consideration for examination timetabling with harmony search, In: GECCO '10: Proceedings of Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, (2010); Al-Betar M.A., Khader A.T., Thomas J.J., A combination of metaheuristic components based on harmony search for the uncapacitated examination timetabling, 8th International Conference On the Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling (PATAT 2010), (2010); Al-Betar M.A., Doush I.A., Khader A.T., Awadallah M.A., Novel selection schemes for harmony search, Appl Math Comput, 218, 10, pp. 6095-6117, (2012); Al-Betar M.A., Khader A.T., Zaman M., University course timetabling using a hybrid harmony search metaheuristic algorithm, IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Part C Appl Rev, pp. 1-18, (2012); Alatas B., Chaotic harmony search algorithms, Appl Math Comput, 216, 9, pp. 2687-2699, (2010); Alia O., Mandava R., The variants of the harmony search algorithm: an overview, Artif Intell Rev, 36, pp. 49-68, (2011); Almansoori W., Gao S., Jarada T., Elsheikh A., Murshed A., Jida J., Alhajj R., Rokne J., Link prediction and classification in social networks and its application in healthcare and systems biology, Network Modeling and Analysis In Health Informatics and Bioinformatics, pp. 1-10; Androulakis I., Maranas C., Floudas C., Prediction of oligopeptide conformations via deterministic global optimization, J Glob Optim, 11, 1, pp. 1-34, (1997); Anfinsen C.B., Principles that govern the folding of protein chains, Science, 181, 4096, pp. 223-230, (1973); Baker D., A surprising simplicity to protein folding, Nature, 405, 6782, pp. 39-42, (2000); Blum C., Roli A., Metaheuristics in combinatorial optimization: Overview and conceptual comparison, ACM Comput Surv, 35, 3, pp. 268-308, (2003); Brooks B.R., Bruccoleri R.E., Olafson B.D., States D.J., Swaminathan S., Karplus M., CHARMM: a program for macromolecular energy, minimization, and dynamics calculations, J Comput Chem, 4, 2, pp. 187-217, (1983); Chivian D., Robertson T., Bonneau R., Baker D., Ab initio methods, Methods Biochem Anal, 44, pp. 547-558, (2003); Chothia C., Lesk A., The relation between the divergence of sequence and structure in proteins, EMBO J, 5, 4, pp. 823-826, (1986); Cutello V., Narzisi G., Nicosia G., A multi-objective evolutionary approach to the protein structure prediction problem, J Roy Soc Interface, 3, 6, pp. 139-151, (2006); Das S., Mukhopadhyay A., Roy A., Abraham A., Panigrahi B.K., Exploratory power of the harmony search algorithm: Analysis and improvements for global numerical optimization, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 41, 1, pp. 89-106, (2011); Delano W.L., The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, (2002); Dorn M., Breda A., Norberto de Souza O., A hybrid method for the protein structure prediction problem, Advances In Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.

Hence, there is an increasing need to access databases at the fastest possible rate. Where biologists are concerned, the need is more of a means to fast, scalable and accuracy searching in biological databases. This may seem to be a simple task, given the speed of current available gigabytes processors. However, this is far from the truth as the growing number of data which are deposited into the database are ever increasing. Hence, searching the database becomes a difficult and time-consuming task. Here, the computer scientist can help to organize data in a way that allows biologists to quickly search existing information and to predict new entries. In this paper, a decision tree indexing method is presented. This method of indexing can effectively and rapidly retrieve all the similar proteins from a large database for a given protein query. A theoretical and conceptual frameworks is derived, based on published works using indexing techniques for different applications. © 2010 IEEE.","","Biomedical engineering; Decision trees; Indexing (of information); Proteins; Biological database; Computer scientists; Conceptual frameworks; Indexing methods; Indexing techniques; Large database; Number of datum; Protein sequence database; Time-consuming tasks; Tree-based methods; Database systems","","","","","","","Williams H.E., Zobel J., Indexing and retrieval for genomic databases, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 14, 1, pp. 63-78, (2002); Westhead D., Parish H., Twyman R., Instant Notes in Bioinformatics, (2002); Backofen R., Gilbert D., Bioinformatics and constraints, Constraints, 6, 2-3, pp. 141-156, (2001); Cong S., Han J., Hoeflinger J., Padua D., A sampling-based framework for parallel data mining, Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming, PPOPP, pp. 255-265, (2005); Cheung D.W., Ng V.T., Fu A.W., Fu Y., Efficient mining of association rules in distributed databases, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 8, 6, pp. 911-922, (1996); Murthy S.K., Automatic construction of decision trees from data: A multi-disciplinary survey, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 2, 4, pp. 345-389, (1998); Safavian S.Rasoul, Landgrebe David, A survey of decision tree classifier methodology, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, 21, 3, pp. 660-674, (1991); Jiang X., Zhang P., Liu X., Yau S.S.-T., Survey on index based homology search algorithms, Journal of Supercomputing, 40, 2, pp. 185-212, (2007); Fondrat C., Dessen P., A rapid access moti f database (ramdb) with a search algorithm for the retrieval patterns in nucleic acids or protein databanks, Comput.

Multicast and anycast are the popular group services used for group network activities. This group of hosts in one or more networks requires a management service that allows new members to join or leave as they wish. This information is then used by end host to acquire group services. In IPA and IPv6 multicast, Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) are being used for group membership management. However the new communication paradigm anycast, is lack of such mechanism for its Group Membership Management (GMM). This paper proposes a new protocol known as Anycast Group Membership Management Protocol (AGMP) to support global anycast GMM. Existing multicast GMM has been explored and distinguished with our proposed AGW. AGW solution is not expensive in terms of memory and computation. It is scalable to support large numbers of groups and members per group. Design and simulated implementation results of the group membership behavior is presented in this paper. © 2003 IEEE.","Availability; Computational modeling; Computer network management; Computer science; IEEE news; Internet; Multicast protocols; Network servers; Routing protocols; Web server","Availability; Computer networks; Computer science; Internet; Multicasting; Network management; Routing protocols; Computational model; IEEE news; Multicast protocol; Network server; Web servers; Internet protocols","","","","","","","Metz C., IP Anycast, ""Point-to-(Any) Point Communication,"", (2002); Pattridge C., Mendez T., Miliken W., Host Anycasting Service, (1993); Deering S., Hinden R., Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification, (1998); Ettikan K., Abdullah R., An Analysis Of Anycast Architecture, IASTED International Conference Communications and Computer Networks (CCN 2002), November 4-6, 2002 USA; Ettikan K., An Analysis of Anycast Architecture and Transport Layer Problems, APRICOT 2001, (2001); Ettikan K., Abdullah R., SLINA: Fault Tolerant and Load Balanced Global IPv6 Anycasting for Service Locating, Deploying IPv6 Networks, (2002); Fenner W., Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 2, (1997); Deering S., Fenner W., Haberman B., Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPV6, (1999); Rekhter Y., Li T., A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4), (1995); Haberman B., Thaler D., Host-based Anycast Using MLD, (2001); Malkin G., RIP Version 2, (1998); Coltun R., Fergusan D., May J., Open Shortest Path First for IPv6, (1999); Network Simulator Version 2; Deering S., Host Extensions for IP Multicasting, (1989); Cain B., Et al., Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 3, (2002); Judge P., Ammar M., Gothic: A Group Access Control Architecture for Secure Multicast and Anycast, INFOCOM 2002, Pro.

The most optimal algorithm used in sequence alignment is based on the dynamic programming method. SmithWaterman algorithm [1] is the most commonly used dynamic programming based sequence alignment algorithm. However the algorithm uses quadratic time and space. Heuristic algorithm such as FASTA [2] and BLAST [3] were introduced to speed up the sequence alignment algorithm. FASTA is based on word search whereas BLAST is based on Maximum Segment Pairs. In word search algorithm, lists of words from the query and database sequence are being compared to determine if two sequences have a region of sufficient similarity to merit further alignment using the Smith-Waterman Algorithm. All the different algorithms use the substitutions matrix based on the twenty alphabet amino acids. However research [4] shows that reducing the number of amino acids to 10 does not affect the similarity measure. Our proposed algorithm uses the reduced amino acids alphabet to transform the protein sequences into a sequence of integer and uses n-gram to reduce the length of the sequence. Then the Smith-Waterman algorithm is used to get the similarity measure between two sequences. Result shows that the new proposed algorithm is as sensitive as the Smith-Waterman algorithm yet uses less space and performs better. © 2006 IEEE.","N-gram methods; Reduce amino acids alphabet; Sequence alignment","Acids; Algorithms; Alignment; Amination; Amines; Amino acids; BASIC (programming language); Boolean functions; Dynamic analysis; Dynamic programming; Dynamics; Evolutionary algorithms; Explosives; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic programming; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linear programming; Mathematical programming; Mathematical transformations; Mechanics; Microfluidics; Multimedia systems; Multiprocessing systems; Neodymium; Nonlinear programming; Numerical methods; Organic acids; Quadratic programming; Radio telescopes; Scheduling algorithms; Systems engineering; Basic operation; Distributed frameworks; international conferences; multimedia applications; Optimal algorithms; Protein sequence alignments; Protein sequence analysis; protein sequencing; Quadratic time; search algorithms; Sequence alignments; Similarity measuring; Smith-waterman algorithms; Speed ups; Integer programming","","","","","","","Smith T.F., Waterman M.S., Identification of common molecular subsequences, J.

The two main protocols involve in the packet transmission are the routing tree formation protocol (RTFP) and the packet forwarding protocol (PFP). Besides that, several types of routing techniques such as single path routing (SPR) and multi-path routing (MPR) are being used by current communication services. In this paper we have analyzed static and dynamic routing mechanism for anycast packets in SPR and MPR. New RTFP have been designed and proposed for this new anycast mechanism based on our research. The tree of each network topology can be determined and formed by different routing tree formation protocol like AGBSPF algorithm (SPF), load-balanced AGBSPF algorithm, load propagation algorithm for server over-load announcement and core-based tree (CBT). We have implemented the dynamic routing algorithms, which are suitable for IP anycast packet forwarding. The objective of the dynamic routing algorithm is to minimize the computational complexity to update the tree and maintain the routing stability by making minimal changes to the current routing tree of the network. After the tree formations, the packet forwarding protocol will decide the transmission of the packets based on the cost factor. The major outcome of this paper is new dynamic RTFP and PFP. © 2003 IEEE.","Computational complexity; Costs; Heuristic algorithms; IEEE news; Internet; Network servers; Network topology; Routing protocols; Stability; Telecommunication traffic","Algorithms; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Convergence of numerical methods; Costs; Dynamic routing algorithms; Dynamics; Forestry; Heuristic algorithms; Internet; Network routing; Routers; Routing protocols; Telecommunication traffic; Topology; Trees (mathematics); Communication service; Dynamic routing protocols; IEEE news; Network server; Network topology; Packet transmissions; Propagation algorithm; Single-path routing; Internet protocols","","","","","","","Jia W., Xuan D., Zhao W., Integrated Routing Algorithms for Anycast Messages, IEEE Transom Networking, 1, (2000); Narvaez P., Siu K.-Y., Tzeng H.-Y., New Dynamic Algorithms for Shortest Path Tree Computation, (2000); Jia W., Zhao W., Xuan D., Xu G., An Efficient Fault-Tolerant Multicast Routing Protocol with Core-Based Tree Techniques, 10, 10, pp. 984-1000, (1999); Zhang B., Mouftah H.T., A Destination-Driven Shortest Path Tree Algorithm; Fujinoki H., Christensen K.J., The New Shortest Best Path Tree (SBPT) Algorithm for Dynamic Multicast Trees; Diot C., Dabbous W., Crowcroft J., Multipoint Communication: A Survey of Protocols, Functions, and Mechanisms, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, (1997); Ettikan K., Abdullah R., An Analysis Of Anycast Architecture, IASTED International Conference Communications and Computer Networks (CCN 2002), November 4-6, 2002,USA; Metz C., IP Anycast Point-to- (Any) Point Communication; Xuan D., Jia W., Routing Algorithm for Anycast Messages, IEEE Trans.on Networking, (1998); Ettikan K., Hagino J.-I.I., An Analysis of IPv6 Anycast, (2002); Ettikan K., Abdullah R., SLINA: Fault Tolerant and Load Balanced Global IPv6 Anycasting for Service Locating, Deploying IPv6 Networks, (2002); Xuan D., Jia W., A Routing Protocol for Anycast Messages, IEEE Transactions on Parallel & Distributed Systems; Stallings W., ""High-Speed Networks, TCP/IP and ATM Design and Principles"", Third Edition; Ganguly A., Lassila P., A Study of TCP-RED Congestion Control Using ns2, (2001); Ponnusamy V., Karuppiah E.K., Abdullah R., Anycast Group Membership Management Protocol","","Anuar K.; Abdul Rashid H.A.B.; Ismail M.; Abdalla A.G.E.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Telekom Malaysia Berhad","9th IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications, APCC 2003, in conjunction with 6th Malaysia International Conference on Communications, MICC 2003","21 September 2003 through 24 September 2003","Penang","115525","","0780381149; 978-078038114-8","","","English","APCC - Asia-Pac.

We named this combination as ACOPIN. The purpose of this work is two-fold. First, to test the efficacy of ACO in clustering PIN and second, to propose the simple generalization of the ACO algorithm that might allow its application in clustering proteins in PIN. We split this paper to three main sections. First, we describe the PIN and clustering proteins in PIN. Second, we discuss the steps involved in each phase of ACO algorithm. Finally, we present some results of the investigation with the clustering patterns. © 2008 IEEE.","","Active networks; Computer systems; Flow interactions; Flow of solids; Magnetic properties; Magnetic susceptibility; Optimization; Proteins; Traveling salesman problem; ACO algorithms; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Clustering problems; Protein interaction networks; Traveling salesman; Clustering algorithms","","","","","","","Przulj N., Wigle D.A., Junsica I., Functional topology in a network of protein interactions, Bioinformatics, 20, 3, pp. 340-348, (2004); Climer S., Zhang W., Take a walk and cluster genes: A TSP-based approach to optimal rearrangement clustering,  International conference on machine learning (ICML'04), pp. 169-176, (2004); Johnson O., Liu J., A Traveling Salesman Approach for predicting protein functions, Source Code for Biology and Medicine 2006, 1:3, (2006); Climer S., Zhang W., Rearrangement clustering: Pitfalls, remedies and applications, Journal of Machine Learning of Machine Learning Research; Lenstra J.K., Kan A.H.G.R., Some simple applications of the traveling salesman problem, Oper Res Quant, 26, pp. 717-733, (1975); Dorigo M., Stuetzle T., Ant Colony Optimization, (2004); Lin S., Kernighan B.W., An Effective Heuristic Algorithm for the Traveling-Salesman Problem, Operations Res, 21, pp. 498-516, (1973); Dorigo M., Maniezzo V., Colorni A., The ant system: Optimization by a colony of cooperating agents, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part B, 26, 1, (1996); Access on, (2007); Csardi G., Nepusz T., The igraph software package for complex network research, InterJournal Complex Systems, (2006); Asur S., Et al., Bioinformatics, (2007); Arnau V., Et al., Iterative cluster analysis of protein interaction data, Bioinformatics, 21, pp. 364-378, (2005); Ucar, Et al., Effective Pre-Processing Strategies for Functional Clustering of a Protein-Protein Interactions Network, BIBE, 2005, pp. 129-136, (2005); Ashburner M., Et al., Gene Ontology: Tool for the unification of biology.

Hence, there is an increasing need to access databases at the fastest possible rate. Where biologists are concerned, the need is more of a means to fast, scalable and accuracy searching in biological databases. This may seem to be a simple task, given the speed of current available gigabytes processors. However, this is far from the truth as the growing numbers of data which are deposited into the database are ever increasing. Hence, searching the database becomes a difficult and time-consuming task instead. Here, the computer scientist can help to organize data in a way that allows biologists to quickly search existing information and to predict new entries. In this study, a decision tree indexing method is presented. This method of indexing can effectively and rapidly retrieve all the similar proteins from a large database for a given protein query. Consequently, it can also be used as a predicted model to predict proteins which have not been determined experimentally. Based on published works using indexing techniques for different applications, the theoretical concept is presented and the decision tree can be adapted for use in indexing databases. © 2010 IEEE.","Bioinformatics; Data mining; Decision tree; Indexing database; Protein sequence; Protein structure","Bioinformatics; Data mining; Decision trees; Indexing (of information); Information technology; Proteins; Biological database; Computer scientists; Indexing database; Indexing methods; Indexing techniques; Large database; Protein sequence; Protein structure; Time-consuming tasks; Database systems","","","","","","","Califano A., Rigoutsos I., Flash: A fast look-up algorithm for string homology, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 1993.

Anycasting is one of the new service technologies produced by this invention and requires a new addressing scheme, routing protocols, group management protocol and application support. Address look-up, a novel IP packet forwarding problem needs to be tackled for easy and effective anycast service deployment. Various methods have been proposed for IPv6 global unicast address lookup for high-speed networks, but not for anycast address. This paper discusses the analysis, design and implementation of anycast address look-up mechanism in network processor (NP) for gigabit networks which is an integral part of our SLINA (service locating using initial network layer anycast) architecture for global IPv6 anycast service locating. Our simple and effective solution can be easily adopted and integrated for today's network equipment which supports global unicast addresses. We also discuss the methods for integrated global unicast and anycast address lookup. © 2003 IEEE.","Access protocols; Hardware; High-speed networks; IP networks; Network servers; Routing protocols; Unicast; Web and internet services; Web server; Wire","Computer hardware; HIgh speed networks; Internet; Network layers; Patents and inventions; Routing protocols; Web services; Wire; Access protocols; Internet services; IP networks; Network server; Unicast; Web servers; Internet protocols","","","","","","","Pattridge C., Mendez T., Miliken W., Host Anycasting Service, (1993); Deering S., Hinden R., An IPv6 Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Format, (1998); Ettikan K., Abdullah R., An Analysis Of Anycast Architecture, IASTED International Conference Communications and Computer Networks (CCN 2002), November 4-6, 2002 USA; Ettikan K., An Analysis of Anycast Architecture and Transport Layer Problems, APRICOT 2001, (2001); Ettikan K., Abdullah R., SLINA: Fault Tolerant and Load Balanced Global IPv6 Anycasting for Service Locating, Deploying IPv6 Networks, (2002); Pinar A.Y., Andrey B., Necdet U., A Trie-Based Algorithm for IP Lookup Problem, GLOBECOM '00, IEEE, 1, pp. 593-598, (2000); Lampson B., Srivinisan V., Varghese G., IP Lookups Using Multiway and Multicolumn Search, Networking, IEEE/ACM Tran., 7, 3, pp. 324-334, (1999); Kijkanjanarat T., Chao H.J., Fast IP Lookups Using A Two-Trie Data Structure, GLOBECOM '99, IEEE, 2, pp. 1570-1575, (1999); Wang P.C., Chan C.T., Chen Y.C., Performance Enhancement of IP Forwarding by Reducing Routing Table Construction Time, IEEE Communications Letters, 5, 5, (2001); Oh S.H., Ahn J.S., Bit Map Trie: A Data Structure for Fast Forwarding Lookups, GLOBECOM '01, IEEE, 3, pp. 1872-1876, (2001); Wang P.C., Chan C.T., Chen Y.C., A Fast IP Routing Lookup Scheme, IEEE Communications Letters, 5, 3, (2001); Ruiz-Sanchez M.A., Biersack E.W., Dabbous W., Survey and Taxonomy of IP Address Lookup Algorithm, Network, IEEE, 15, 2, pp. 8-23, (2001); Nen-Fu H., Whai-En C., Jiau-Yu L., Jun-Min C., Design of Multi-field IPv6 Packet Classifiers Using Ternary CAMS, GLOBECOM '01, IEEE, 3, pp. 1877-1881, (2001); Hayashi T., Miyazaki T., High Speed Table Lookup Engine for IPv6 Longest Prefix Match, GLOBECOM '99, IEEE, 2, pp. 1576-1581, (1999); Deering S., Hinden R., IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture, (1998); Ettikan K., Abdullah R., High Speed Packet Processing Challenges for Network Processors, M2USIC, (2002); Networking & Communications Building Blocks, Network Processors, (2002); Networking Technologies, (2002); Revolutionizing the Way Internet Infrastructure Is Built, (2002); Broadband Processor Product Line, (2002); Intel® IXP1200 Network Processor","","Ismail M.; Anuar K.; Abdul Rashid H.A.B.; Abdalla A.G.E.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Telekom Malaysia Berhad","9th IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications, APCC 2003, in conjunction with 6th Malaysia International Conference on Communications, MICC 2003","21 September 2003 through 24 September 2003","Penang","115525","","0780381149; 978-078038114-8","","","English","APCC - Asia-Pac.

Parallel versions of GE and LU have been developed and widely implemented on parallel computers. Here, two new parallel methods for matrix elimination and matrix factorisation are presented. Parallel Implicit Elimination method (PIE) is a scheme that eliminates two matrix elements simultaneously. The Quadrant Interlocking Factorisation method (QIF) decomposes a matrix into two quadrant interlocking factors of ""butterfly"" form denoted by W and Z. The solution of GE and LU methods involve a back substitution process which is sequential in nature. PIE and QIF offer a parallel solution called bidirectional substitution. Here the performance of the PIE and QIF algorithms on a message-passing architecture is compared to that of the GE and LU methods respectively. The theoretical analysis of communication within the algorithms revealed that the communication involved in PIE and QIF is half that of GE and LU.","Implicit elimination; LU factorisation; Quadrant interlocking factorisation linear equations gaussion elimination","Factorization; Linear equations; Matrix algebra; Message passing; Computer architecture; Data communication systems; Data storage equipment; Matrix algebra; Parallel algorithms; Response time (computer systems); Communication analysis; Distributed memory architecture; Gaussian elimination; Implicit elimination; Matrix factorisation; Message passing architectures; Quadrant interlocking factorisation linear equations gaussion elimination; Systems of linear equations; Gaussian elimination (GE); Linear equations; Parallel implicit elimination (PIE) methods; Quadrant interlocking factorization (QIF) methods; Memory architecture; Parallel processing systems","","","","","","","Evans D.J., Implicit Matrix Elimination (IME) Schemes, Int.

Since humans tend to use high-level semantic concepts when querying and browsing multimedia databases, there is an increasing need for semantic video indexing and analysis. For this purpose, we proposed a unified framework for semantic extraction retrieval with motion vector analysis and color tracking model in sports video and also focus on clustering by aggregating shots or key-frames with similar low-level features, the proposed scheme employs supervised learning to perform a top-down video shot classification. This paper also focuses on the integration of multimodal features for sport video structure analysis. In this paper stochastic modeling and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that can be efficiently applied to merge audio and visual cues. Currently our approach is validated in the particular domain of tennis videos. For initial analysis we undergone a pilot prototype study with existing works and added up proposed methods, based on results achieved we further need to enhanced the framework.

This method groups the proteins based on their common features. It is a core process in protein sequence classification. Graph theory has been used in protein sequence clustering as a means of partitioning the data into groups, where each group constitutes a cluster. Mohseni-Zadeh introduced a maximal cliques algorithm for protein clustering. Approach: In this study we adapted the maximal cliques algorithm of Mohseni-Zadeh to find cliques in protein sequences and we then parallelized the algorithm to improve computation times and allowed large protein databases to be processed. We used the N-Gram Hirschberg approach proposed by Abdul Rashid to calculate the distance between protein sequences. The task farming parallel program model was used to parallelize the enhanced cliques algorithm. Results: Our parallel maximal cliques algorithm was implemented on the stealth cluster using the C programming language and a hybrid approach that includes both the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library and POSIX threads (PThread) to accelerate protein sequence clustering.

K-means has been used in many clustering work because of the ease of the algorithm. Our main effort is to parallelize the k-means clustering algorithm. The parallel version is implemented based on the inherent parallelism during the Distance Calculation and Centroid Update phases. The parallel K-means algorithm is designed in such a way that each P participating node is responsible for handling n/P data points. We run the program on a Linux Cluster with a maximum of eight nodes using message-passing programming model. We examined the performance based on the percentage of correct answers and its speed-up performance. The outcome shows that our parallel K-means program performs relatively well on large datasets.","","Computational methods; Computer programming; Data reduction; Iterative methods; Mathematical models; Servers; Clustering algorithms; Computation time; Data-sets; Programming models; Algorithms","","","","","","","Dillon I.S., Modha D.S., A data-clustering on distributed memory multiprocessors, ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Large-scale Parallel KDD System (KDD 99), (1999); Wan X., Bridges S.M., Boyle J., Boyle A., Interactive Clustering for Exploration of Genomic Data, (2002); Alsabti K., Ranka S., Singh V., An Efficient K-means Clustering Algorithm, (1997); Murakami K., Takagi T., Clustering and detectionof 5' splices sitesof mRNA by K wight matrices model, Pac Symp BioComputing, pp. 171-181, (1999); Kantabutra S., Couch A.L., Parallel K-means clustering algorithm on NOWs, NECTEC Technical Journal, 1, 6, pp. 243-248, (2002); Stoffel K., Belkoniene A., Parallel K/H-means clustering for large data sets, Proceedings of the European Conference on Parallel Processing EuroPar'99, (1999); Kantabutra S., Naramittakapong C., Kornpitak P., Pipeline K-means algorithm on NOWs, Proceeding of the Third International Symposium on Communication and Information Technology (ISCIT2003), (2003); Forman G., Zhang B., Linear speed-up for a parallel non-approximate recasting of center-based clustering algorithm,including K-means,K-harmonic means and EM, ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Distributed and Parallel Knowledge Discovery (KDD2000), (2000); Chaudari P., Dass S., Statistical analysis of large DNA sequences using distribution of DNA words, CURREBT SCIENCE, 80, 9, pp. 1161-1166, (2001)","F.

A new Internet addressing protocol, IPv6 with wide range of addresses has been proposed to replace the existing IPv4. Hence, the backbone routers need to maintain larger IPv6-based lookup tables with relevant forwarding information to the next hops. Since the destination address fields of the IPv6 packet is 128 bits each, this means that the lookup table need to maintain up to 2128 entries. Normal linear lookup method is not suitable, in terms of time and memory consumption, for the lookup operation. In this paper we proposed an efficient partition based scheme compared to existing method of Chang and Lim with software implementation [R.C.

The fundamental idea behind this work is to exploit an ontology hierarchical structure in order to find a topic of a text. The keywords that are extracted from a given text will be mapped onto their corresponding concepts in the ontology. By optimizing the corresponding concepts, we will pick a single node among the concepts nodes that we believe is the topic of the target text. However, a limited vocabulary problem is encountered while mapping the keywords onto their corresponding concepts. This situation forces us to extend the ontology by enriching each of its concepts with new concepts using the external linguistics knowledge-base (WordNet). Our intuition of a high number keywords mapped onto the ontology concepts is that our topic identification technique can perform at its best. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.","","Computational linguistics; Knowledge based systems; Text processing; Hierarchical structures; Knowledge base; Ontology concepts; Topic identification; Wordnet; Ontology","","","","","","","Banerjee S., Mittal V.O., On the Use of Linguistics Ontologies for Acessing Distributed Digital Libraries, Proceeding of the First Annual Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries, (1994); Chakrabarti S., Dom B., Indyk P., Enhanced Hypertext Categorization Using Hyperlinks, (1998); Chekuri C., Goldwasser M.H., Raghavan P., Upfal E., Web Search Using Automated Classification, (1997); D'Alessio D., Murray K., Schiaffino R., Kreshenbaum A., Hierarchical Text Categorization, Proceeding RIAO 2000, (2000); D'Alessio D., Murray K., Schiaffino R., Kreshenbaum A., The effect of Topological Structure on Hierarchical Text Categorization, Proceeding of the Sixth Workshop on Very Large Corpora, COLLING ACL '98, (1998); Govert N., Lalmas M., Fuhr N., A Probabilistic Description-Oriented Approach for Categorizing Web Document, Proceeding of the Eighth International Conference on Information Knowledge Management, pp. 475-482, (1999); Gelbukh A., Sidorov G., Guzman A., A Method of Describing Document Contents through Topic Selection, Proc. of International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval, Cancun, Mexico, (1999); Gelbukh A., Sidorov G., Guzman A., Use of a Weighted Topic Hierarchy for Document Classification,  International Workshop.

Anycasting is one of the new service technologies produced by this invention and requires a new addressing scheme, routing protocols, group management protocol and application support. Address look-up, a novel IP packet forwarding problem needs to be tackled for easy and effective anycast service deployment. Various methods have been proposed for IPv6 global unicast address lookup for high-speed networks, but not for anycast address. This paper discusses the analysis, design and implementation of integrated unicast and anycast address look-up mechanism at Network Processor (NP) for gigabit networks which is an integral part of our SLINA (Service Locating using Initial Network layer Anycast) architecture for global IPv6 anycast service locating. Our simple and effective solution can be easily adopted and integrated for todays' network equipment which supports global unicast addresses.","Anycast; High Speed Network; Longest Prefix Match; Look-up; Network Processor; Unicast","Computer architecture; Cryptography; Data storage equipment; Internet; Optical interconnects; Routers; Servers; Anycast; High speed networks; Longest prefix match (LPM); Unicast; Network protocols","","","","","","","Pattridge C., Mendez T., Miliken W., Host anycasting service, RFC, 1546, (1993); Deering S., Hinden R., An IPv6 Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Format, (1998); Ettikan K., Abdullah R., An analysis of anycast architecture, IASTED International Conference Communications and Computer Networks (CCN 2002), (2002); Ettikan K., An analysis of anycast architecture and transport layer problems, APRICOT 2001, (2001); Ettikan K., Abdullah R., SLINA: Fault tolerant and load balanced global IPv6 anycasting for service locating, Deploying IPv6 Networks, (2002); Pinar A.Y., Andrey B., Necdet U., A trie-based algorithm for ip lookup problem, Proc.

RNA structures determination have become a major problem in the biology context. Recently, computer scientists have empowered the biologists with RNA secondary structures that ease an understanding of the RNA functions and roles. Detecting RNA secondary structure is an NP-hard problem, especially in pseudoknotted RNA structures. The detection process is also time-consuming; as a result, an alternative approach such as using parallel architectures is a desirable option. The main goal in this paper is to do an intensive investigation of parallel methods used in the literature to solve the demanding issues, related to the RNA secondary structure prediction methods. Then, we introduce a new taxonomy for the parallel RNA folding methods. Based on this proposed taxonomy, a systematic and scientific comparison is performed among these existing methods. © 2010 SAGE Publications.","dynamic programming (DP); FPGA; free energy minimization;

Neural networks have been used before to abstract the properties of protein superfamilies. One approach is to use a single conventional neural network to abstract the properties of different protein superfamilies. Since the number of protein superfamilies is in the thousands, we propose another approach - one network attuned to one protein superfamily. Furthermore, we propose to use weightless neural networks, coupled with Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The advantages of weightless neural networks are: (a) the ability to learn with only one presentation of training patterns - thus improving performance, (b) ease of implementation, and (c) ease of parallelization - thus improving scalability.","","Arrays; Data acquisition; Markov processes; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Probabilistic logics; Hidden Markov models (HMM); Neural network arrays; Protein classification; Resonant networks; Proteins","","","","","","","Pandit Shashi B., Et al., SUPFAM - A Database of Potential Protein Superfamily Relationships, (2001); Wang J., Ma Q., Shasha D., Wu C., Application of Neural Networks to Biological Data Mining: A Case Study in Protein Sequence Classification, (2001); Krogh A., An Introduction to Hidden Markov Models for Biological Sequence, (1998); Ohler U., Stemmer G., Niemann H., A Hybrid Markov Chain - Neural Network System for the Exact Prediction of Eukaryotic Transcription Start Sites, (2000); Burattini E., DeGregorio M., Tamburrini G., Generating and Classifying Recall Images by Neurosymbolic Computation, (1998)","M.C.W.

The biologists often encounter problems in accessing huge amount of widely spread data due to disparate formats, remotely dispersed and varying implementation on different platforms and data models. Besides that, the custom browsing and querying mechanism implemented in different data sources requires the users to uniquely query each individual database. Instead of having different custom interfaces to these public bioinformatics databases, an intuitive common integrated data access method is proposed to provide uniform transparent access to disparate biological databases.

The current packet forwarding algorithms are designed specifically to route IPv4 packets. The lack of IPv4 addresses to support the vast growing Internet users and the increase in routing table size, have contributed to the birth of IPv6. IP version 6 (IPv6) is a new version of the Internet protocol designed as the successor to IP version 4 (IPv4). Various algorithms for high-performance IP address lookup have been proposed. In this paper, we propose possible designs for IPv6 anycast address lookup using trier tables and compare these designs in terms of lookup speed and storage requirements. © 2003 IEEE.","Aggregates; Algorithm design and analysis; Data structures; Inspection; Internet; Network servers; Protocols; Routing; Table lookup; Unicast","Aggregates; Algorithms; Data structures; Digital storage; Inspection; Internet; Network protocols; Routers; Table lookup; Algorithm design and analysis; Internet traffic; IP address lookup; Network server; Packet forwarding; Routing; Storage requirements; Unicast; Internet protocols","","","","","","","Tzeng H.H.Y., Przygienda T., On fast address-lookup algorithms, IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in Communications, 17, 6, pp. 1067-1082, (1999); Semeria C., Understanding IP Addressing: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know, (1996); Deering S., Hinden R., Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification, (1998); Deering S., Hinden R., IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture, (1998); Ruiz-Sanchez M.A., Biersack E.W., Dabbous W., Survey and taxonomy of IP address lookup algorithms, IEEE Network, 15, 2, pp. 8-23, (2001); Nilsson S., Karlson G., IP-Address Lookup Using LC-Tries, IEEE Network, 17, 6, pp. 1083-1092, (1999); Srinivasan V., Varghese G., Faster IP Lookups using Controlled Prefix Expansion, Proc.

The structure of the protein determines its function. In order to predict the protein structure computationally, protein must be represented in a proper representation. To this end, an energy function is used to calculate its energy and a conformational search algorithm is used to search the conformational search space to find the lowest free energy conformation. In this paper, the Bees Algorithm, i.e. a Swarm Intelligence based algorithm inspired by the foraging behaviour of honey bees colony is adapted to search the protein conformational search space. The algorithm was able to find the lowest free energy conformation of Met-enkephaline using ECEPP/2 force fields. © 2008 IEEE.","","Alpha particle spectrometers; Asset management; Cellular automata; Free energy; Learning algorithms; Particle spectrometers; Biological functions; Conformational search; Energy conformations; Energy functions; Force fields; Honey bees; Human bodies; International conferences; Modelling and simulation; Protein structures; Swarm intelligence; Algorithms","","","","","","","Pham D.T., Et al., The Bees Algorithm, A Novel Tool for Coplex Optimisation Problems, 2nd International Virtual Conference on Intelligent Production Machines and Systems (IPROMS 2006), (2006); Chiu T.-L., Goldstein R., Optimizing energy potentials for success in protein tertiary structure prediction, Folding and Design, 3, 3, pp. 223-228, (1998); Anfinsen C.B., Principles that govern the folding of protein chains, Science, 181, 96, pp. 223-230, (1973); Zhang H., Protein Tertiary Structures: Prediction from Amino Acid Sequences, Encyclopedia of Life Sciences, (2002); Chan H.S., Dill K.A., The protein folding problem, Physics Today, pp. 24-32, (1993); Schulze-Kremer S., Genetic Algorithms and Protein Folding, Protein Structure Prediction Methods and Protocols, pp. 175-222, (2000); Zhou Y., Abagyan R., Efficient Stochastic Global Optimization for Protein Structure Prediction, Rigidity Theory and Applications, pp. 345-356, (2002); Pham D.T., Et al., Application of the Bees Algorithm to the Training of Learning Vector Quantisation Networks for Control Chart Pattern Recognition, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTTA'06), (2006); Pham D.T., Et al., Optimisation of the Weights of Multi-Layered Perceptrons Using the Bees Algorithm, IMS 2006: 5th International Symposium on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, (2006); Pham D.T., Et al., Optimising Neural Networks for Identification of Wood Defects Using the Bees Algorithm, Industrial Informatics, 2006 IEEE International Conference on, (2006); Abbass H.A., MBO: Marriage in honey bees optimization-a Haplometrosis polygynous swarming approach, (2001); Dietz A., Bee Genetics and Breeding, Evolution, (1986); Seeley T.D., The Wisdom of the Hive The Social Physiology of Honey Bee Colonies, (1995); Lucie P., Modelling Transportation Problems Using Concepts of Swarm Intelligence and Soft Computing, Faculty of the Virginia Polytechnic Instisute and State University, (2002); Wedde H.F., Farooq M., Zhang Y., BeeHive: An Efficient Fault-Tolerant Routing Algorithm Inspired by Honey Bee Behavior, Ant Colony, Optimization and Swarm Intelligence, pp. 83-94, (2004); Wedde H.F., Et al., BeeAdHoc: An energy efficient routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc networks inspired by bee behavior, Proceedings of the 2005 conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation, (2005); Betancourt M.R., Skolnick J., Local Propensities and Statistical Potentials of Backbone Dihedral Angles in Proteins, Journal of Molecular Biology, 342, 2, pp. 635-649, (2004); Dayalan S., Bevinakoppa S., Schroder H., A dihedral angle database of short sub-sequences for protein structure prediction, Proceedings of the second conference on Asia-Pacific bioinformatics, 29, (2004); Zhan L., Chen J.Z.Y., Liu W.-K., Conformational Study of Met-Enkephalin Based on the ECEPP Force Fields, pp. 2399-2404, (2006); Guan X., Et al., Protein structure prediction using hybrid AI methods, Artificial Intelligence for Applications, 1994., Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on, (1994); Mount D.W., Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis, (2004); Eisenmenger F., Et al., An enhanced version of SMMP - open-source software package for simulation of proteins, Computer Physics Communications, 174, 5, pp. 422-429, (2006); Eisenmenger F., Et al., SMMP] A modern package for simulation of proteins, Computer Physics Communications, 138, pp. 192-212, (2001); Jooyoung Lee H.A.S.S.R., New optimization method for conformational energy calculations on polypeptides: Conformational space annealing, pp. 1222-1232, (1997)","H.

HS is a stochastic meta-heuristic that is inspired from the improvisation process of musicians. Unlike Backpropagation, HS is non-trajectory driven. By modifying an existing improved version of HS & adopting a suitable ANN data representation, we propose a training technique where two of HS probabilistic parameters are determined dynamically based on the best-to-worst (BtW) harmony ratio in the current harmony memory instead of the improvisation count. This would be more suitable for ANN training since parameters and termination would depend on the quality of the attained solution. We have empirically tested and verified our technique by training an ANN with a benchmarking problem. In terms of overall training time and recognition, our results have revealed that our method is superior to both the original improved HS and standard Backpropagation. © 2010 IEEE.","Harmony search; Meta-heuristic; Neural network; Optimization","Backpropagation; Heuristic methods; Hydraulic structures; Intelligent systems; Artificial Neural Network; Benchmarking problems; Data representations; Feed-forward artificial neural networks; Harmony search; Metaheuristic; Neural network optimization; Novel techniques; Training techniques; Training time; Neural networks","","","","","","","Chronopoulos A.T., Sarangapani J., A distributed discretetime neural network architecture for pattern allocation and control, Proceedings of the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS'02), Florida, USA, 2002, pp. 204-211; Gupta J.N.D., Sexton R.S., Comparing backpropagation with a genetic algorithm for neural network training, Omega, The International Journal of Management Science, 27, pp. 679-684, (1999); Kim D., Kim H., Chung D., A modified genetic algorithm for fast training neural networks, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3496, I, pp. 660-665, (2005); Wei G., Study on Evolutionary Neural Network Based on Ant Colony Optimization, International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security Workshops Harbin, Heilongjiang, China, 2007, pp. 3-6; Zhang Y., Wu L., Weights Optimization of Neural Networks via Improved BCO Approach, Progress in Electromagnetics Research, 83, pp. 185-198, (2008); Yu J., Wang S., Xi L., Evolving artificial neural networks using an improved PSO and DPSO, Neurocomputing, 71, pp. 1054-1060, (2008); Geem Z.W., Kim J.H., Loganathan G.V., A new heuristic optimization algorithm: Harmony search, Simulation, 76, 2, pp. 60-68, (2001); Geem Z.W., Tseng C.-L., Kim J., Bae C., Trenchless Water Pipe Condition Assessment Using Artificial Neural Network, Pipelines 2007, pp. 1-9, (2007); Alba E., Chicano J.F., Training neural networks with GA hybrid algorithms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 3102, pp. 852-863, (2004); Hamey L.G.C., XOR Has No Local Minima: A Case Study in Neural Network Error Surface Analysis, Neural Networks, 11, pp. 669-681, (1998); Lee K.S., Geem Z.W., A New Meta-heuristic Algorithm for Continuous Engineering Optimization: Harmony Search Theory and Practice, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 194, pp. 3902-3933, (2005); Tangpattanakul P., Artrit P., Minimum-time trajectory of robot manipulator using Harmony Search algorithm, 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON 2009), 1, pp. 354-357, (2009); Geem Z.W., Harmony Search Applications in Industry, Soft Computing Applications in Industry, 226-2008, pp. 117-134, (2008); Lee J.-H., Yoon Y.-S., Modified Harmony Search Algorithm and Neural Networks for Concrete Mix Proportion Design, Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, 23, pp. 57-61, (2009); Forsati R., Mahdavi M., Kangavari M., Safarkhani B., Web page clustering using Harmony Search optimization, Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE 2008) Ontario, Canada: IEEE, Canada, 2008, pp. 1601-1604; Moeinzadeh H., Asgarian E., Zanjani M., Rezaee A., Seidi M., Combination of Harmony Search and Linear Discriminate Analysis to Improve Classification, Third Asia International Conference on Modelling & Simulation (AMS '09) Bandung/bali, Indonesia, 2009, pp. 131-135; Geem Z.W., Tseng C.-L., Park Y., Harmony Search for Generalized Orienteering Problem: Best Touring in China, Advances in Natural Computation, 3612, 2005, pp. 741-750, (2005); Mahdavi M., Fesanghary M., Damangir E., An improved harmony search algorithm for solving optimization problems, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 188, 2, pp. 1567-1579, (2007); Fausett L., Fundamentals of Neural Networks Architectures, Algorithms, and Applications, (1994); Dorsey R.E., Johnson J.D., Mayer W.J., A Genetic Algoirthm for the Training of Feedforward Neural Networks, Advances in A.pngicial Intelligence in Economics, Finance, and Management, 1, pp. 93-111, (1994); Fish K.E., Johnson J.D., Dorsey R.E., Blodgett J.G., Using an Artificial Neural Network Trained with a Genetic Algorithm to Model Brand Share, Journal of Business Research, 57, pp. 79-85, (2004); Sexton R.S., Dorsey R.E., Sikander N.A., Simultaneous Optimization of Neural Network Function and Architecture Algorithm, Decision Support Systems, 30, pp. 11-22, (2004); Hassoun M.H., Fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks, (1995)","A.

Such implementation was intended to address the training of larger pattern-classification problem. The implementation platforms included both a homogeneous and a heterogeneous system of Master-Slave processing nodes. The latter heterogeneous implementation utilized a node benchmarking score obtained via independent software in order to determine the load balancing ratios for the different processing nodes. In this paper an enhanced alternative benchmarking technique is proposed that is based on the actual workload execution times for each heterogeneous processing node. Using the same pattern-classification problem on the same heterogeneous platform setup used in the previous technique, results show that the proposed technique has attained higher speedup in comparison with the former. © 2011 IEEE.","Harmony search; Neural network; Parallel & distributed processing; Pattern-classification","Benchmarking; Communication systems; Distributed parameter control systems; Benchmarking score; Benchmarking techniques; Distributed implementation; Distributed processing; Feed-forward artificial neural networks; Harmony search; Harmony search algorithms; Heterogeneous platforms; Heterogeneous processing; Heterogeneous systems; Implementation platforms; Master-slave; Pattern-classification; Processing nodes; Workload execution; Neural networks","","","","","","","Lee K.S., Geem Z.W., A new meta-heuristic algorithm for continuous engineering optimization: Harmony search theory and practice, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 194, 36-38, pp. 3902-3933, (2005); Geem Z.W., Music-Inspired Harmony Search Algorithm: Theory and Applications, 191, (2009); Geem Z.W., Harmony search applications in industry, Soft Computing Applications in Industry, 226, pp. 117-134, (2008); Kattan A., Abdullah R., Salam R.A., Harmony search based supervised training of artificial neural networks, International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modeling and Simulation (ISMS2010), pp. 105-110, (2010); Kattan A., Abdullah R., Parallel & distributed implementation of the harmony search based supervised training of artificial neural networks, Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation (ISMS2011), pp. 277-283, (2011); Almeida F., Gonzalez D., Moreno L.M., The master-slave paradigm on heterogeneous systems: A dynamic programming approach for the optimal mapping, Journal of Systems Architecture, 52, 2, pp. 105-116, (2006); Clematis A., Corana A., Modeling performance of heterogeneous parallel computing systems, Parallel Computing, 25, pp. 1131-1145, (1999); Yoo R.M., Lee H.-H.S., Lee H., Chow K., Hierarchical means: Single number benchmarking with workload cluster analysis, IEEE 10th International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC 2007), pp. 204-213, (2007); Oi H., Local variable access behavior of hardware-translation based Java virtual machine, The Journal of Systems and Software, 81, pp. 2059-2068, (2008); Park J.H., Demirdag B.A., High performance pattern matching with dynamic load balancing on heterogeneous systems, 14th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing (PDP'06), (2006); Perez J.M., Sanchez L.M., Garcia F., Calderon A., Carretero J., High performance Java input/output for heterogeneous distributed computing, Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications, pp. 969-974, (2005); Al-Jaroodi J., Mohamed N., Jiang H., Swanson D., Modeling parallel applications performance on heterogeneous systems, Proceedings of the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS'03), (2003); Shirazi J., Java Performance Tuning, (2003); Java Tuning White Paper, (2005); Miller F.P., Vandome A.F., Java Virtual Machine, (2009); Boyer B., Robust Java benchmarking, Part 1: Issues: Understanding the pitfalls of benchmarking Java code, IBM DeveloperWorks, pp. 1-20, (2008)","A.

Though there have been numerous techniques used for their implementations, the choice of a specific implementation is subjected to different factors including cost, accuracy, processing speed and overall performance. Featured with synaptic plasticity, the process of training is concerned with adjusting the individual weights between each of the individual ANN neurons until we can achieve close to the desired output. Regardless of the implementation hardware, it is always preferable to have soft network architecture in the early stages of application development. This would facilitate the process of rapidly modifying the network's size and learning method. Software simulation on conventional computers is usually used as a measure of performance to compare with other approaches for ANN implementations. This chapter introduces the common trajectory-driven and evolutionary-based ANN training algorithms. Implementation considers the use of cost effective techniques that is based on commodity hardware including implementations using graphical processing units (GPU) and parallel heterogeneous systems. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A microprocessor can take as input, a very large number of data patterns, and for each input data pattern, a corresponding expected output data pattern must be produced. To test a microprocessor, the device is placed on a tester, which feeds input data patterns, and collects output data patterns, from the device under test. The collected output data pattern is compared against the expected output data pattern in order to determine the correctness of the device under test. The data for the input patterns are provided by the microprocessor design team. With every design change, the input patterns must be regenerated. Changes in input patterns will cause changes in the expected output patterns. Due to the large number of input patterns, an equally large number of expected output patterns have to be generated. As a result of this, a significant amount of time will elapse before testing can proceed after each microprocessor design revision. In order to overcome this, we investigated the use of parallel processing for the generation of the expected output pattern file. The generation of the expected output pattern data - from a given set of input pattern data - is called ""pattern conversion"". © 2005 IEEE.","Parallel processing; Semiconductor testing","Data acquisition; Data structures; Parallel processing systems; Testing; Parallel processing; Semiconductor testing; Microprocessor chips","","","","","","","Siegel S., Modeling MPI Programs for Verification, (2004); Kaiser T., Parallel Programming with MPI, (1998)","","","","","2005 13th IEEE International Conference on Networks jointly held with the 2005 7th IEEE Malaysia International Conference on Communications","16 November 2005 through 18 November 2005","Kuala Lumpur","69263","","1424400007; 978-142440000-3","","","English","2005 13th IEEE Int.

The parallel implementations of these methods in solving the Poisson equation and the results of some computational experiments were also discussed. Two parallelizing strategies were developed where the algorithms turned out to be relatively efficient. Near linear speedups were also obtained. The results indicate that the problem is able to benefit from the parallelization as the amount of work increases.

With multi-core architecture there are different parallel languages that can be used to run parallel programs. One of these languages is OpenMP which embedded in C/C++ or FORTRAN. Because of this new architecture and the complexity, it is very important to evaluate the performance of OpenMP constructs, kernels, and application program on multi-core systems. Performance is the activity of collecting the information about the execution characteristics of a program. Performance tools consists of at least three interfacing software layers, including instrumentation, measurement, and analysis. The instrumentation layer defines the measured performance events. The measurement layer determines what performance event is actually captured and how it is measured by the tool. The analysis layer processes the performance data and summarizes it into a form that can be displayed in performance tools.

RNA secondary structure prediction is a significant area of study for many scientists seeking insights into potential drug interactions or innovative new treatment methodologies. Predicting structure can overcome many issues related with physical structure determination and their study yields information useful in prediction of the full three dimensional structures and also in the interpretation of the biochemical abilities of the molecules. Therefore, predicting the secondary structure of RNA is very important for understanding their function. Furthermore, secondary structures are discrete and thus, well suited for computational methods. In this paper, we present a review on RNA secondary structure prediction using Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm. An analysis of DP algorithm from previous work is discussed. We will present our proposed work for RNA secondary structure prediction using DP algorithm and special-purposed hardware of multi core and Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). We proposed to implement the DP algorithm approach on a hybrid of multi core and GPU platform to speed up the computational process of RNA secondary structure prediction. © 2010 IEEE.","Dynamic Programming algorithm; GPU; Multicore; RNA secondary structure prediction","Acids; Algorithms; Drug interactions; Forecasting; Information technology; RNA; Computational process; Dynamic programming algorithm; GPU; Graphical processing units; Life form; Multi core; Physical structures; Ribonucleic acid; RNA secondary structure prediction; Secondary structures; Speed-ups; Three-dimensional structure; Dynamic programming","","","","","","","Lyngso R.B., Pedersan C.N., RNA pseudoknot prediction in energy based models, Computational Biology, 7, 3-4, pp. 409-427, (2000); Nussinov R., Pieczenik G., Griggs J., Kleitman D., Algorithms for loop matchings, Discrete Applied Mathematics, 35, 1, pp. 68-82, (1978); Sankoff D., Simultaneous solution of the RNA folding, alignment, and proto-sequence problem, Discrete Applied Mathematics, 45, pp. 810-825; Zuker M., Sankoff D., RNA secondary structures and their prediction, Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, 46, 4, pp. 591-621, (1984); Zuker M., Stiegler P., Optimal computer folding of large RNA sequences using thermodynamics and auxilary information, Nucleic Acids Research, 9, 1, pp. 133-148, (1981); Zuker M., Mfold web server for nucleic acid folding and hybridization prediction, Nucleic Acids Research, 31, 13, pp. 3406-3415, (2003); Mathews D.H., Disney M.D., Schroeder J.L., Incorporating Chemical Modification Constrains into Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Prediction of RNA Secondary Structure, 101, 19, pp. 7287-7292, (2004); Hofacker I.L., Vienna RNA secondary structure server, Neucleic Acid Research, 31, 13, pp. 3429-3431, (2003); Wexler Y., Zilberstein C., Ukelson M.Z., A study of accessible motifs and RNA folding complexity, Computational Biology, 14, pp. 856-872, (2007); Akutsu T., Dynamic programming algorithms for RNA secondary structure prediction with pseudoknots, Discere Applied Mathematics, 104, 2000, pp. 45-62, (2000); Reeder J., Giegerich R., Design, implementation and evaluation of a practical pseudoknot folding algorithm based on thermodynamic, BMC Bioinformatics, 5, pp. 104-116, (2004); Hengwu L., Daming Z., Zhendong L., Hong L., Prediction for RNA planar pseudoknots, Progress in Nature Science, 17, 6, pp. 717-724, (2007); Namsrai O.E., Jung K.S., Kim S., Ryu K.H., RNA secondary structure prediction with simple pseudoknots based on Dynamic Programming, International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Bioinformatics '06, pp. 303-311, (2006); Nussinov R., Jacobson A.B., Fast algorithm for predicting the secondary structure of single-stranded RNA, Biochemistry, 77, 11, pp. 6309-6313, (1980); Tan G., Sun N., Feng N., Optimized and efficiently parallelized dynamic programming for RNA secondary structure prediction, Software, 17, 7, pp. 1501-1519, (2006); Tan G., Locality and parallelism optimization for dynamic programming algorithm in bioinformatics, Conference on Supercomputing 2006, pp. 41-51, (2006); Chen J.-H., Le S.-Y., Shapiro B.A., Maizel J.V., Optimization of an RNA folding algorithm for parallel architectures, Parallel Computing, 24, pp. 1617-1634, (1998); Tan G., Sun N., Gao G.R., A parallel dynamic programming algorithm on a multi-core architecture, Nineteenth Annual ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures, pp. 135-144, (2007); Ogoubi E., Pouliot D., Turcotte M., Hafid A., Parallel multiprocessor approaches to the RNA folding problem, Parallel Processing and Applied Matehematics, pp. 1230-1239, (2007); Jacob A., Buhler J., Chamberlain R.D., Accelerating Nusinov RNA secondary structure prediction with systolic arrays on FPGAs, International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors 2008, pp. 191-196, (2008); Charalambous M., Pedro T., Stamtakis A., Initial experiences porting a bioinformatics application to a graphis processor, 10th Panhellenic Conference in Informatics (PCI 2005), 3746, pp. 415-425, (2005); Rizk G., Lavenier D., GPU accelerated RNA folding algorithm, Computational Science, pp. 1004-1013, (2009); Liu Y., Huang W., John J., Vaidya S., GPU acellerated Smith-Waterman, ICCS 2006, pp. 188-195, (2006); Zuker M., Mathews D., Turner D., Algorithms and thermodynamics for RNA secondary structure prediction: A practical guide, RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology, pp. 11-43, (1999); Chen C., Schmidt B., An adaptive grid implementation of DNA sequence alignment, Future Generation Computer System, 21, 7, pp. 988-103, (2005); Rivas E., Eddy S., A Dynamic programming algorithm for RNA structure prediction including pseudoknots, Computational Biology, 285, 5, pp. 2053-2068, (1999); Bockenhauer H.J., Bongartz D., Algorithmic Aspects of Bioinformatics, pp. 320-329, (2007)","M.

According to our investigation majority of current researches were concerned on achieving faster execution time, improving space complexity and better cache management. Recently one research introduced cache-efficient Chip Multiprocessor (CMP) algorithms with good speed-up to exploit parallelism in detection the critical path length. Our contribution in this article was a comprehensive survey of methods for solving RNA secondary structure prediction with Pseudoknots (PK) and sequence alignment in bioinformatics. The aim was to highlight the challenges related issues which would provide sufficient information to assist the new coming researchers in this field as well as a good reference guide for bioinformatics professionals. Approach: We computed various algorithms that predicted an RNA molecules secondary structure from primary sequence, without pseudoknots from one side and pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure in the other side. Furthermore, we also reviewed and compared in two tables the methods that developed for RNA structural predictions. Results: Our findings of this survey confirmed that Dynamic Programming (DP) method via CMP algorithms can be used to predict the RNA secondary structure with simple PK and it gives good results. Conclusion: The methods for predicting RNA's structural are coming in two groups: Firstly, pseudoknotted RNA structural problem is computationally complex and secondly, common methods significantly gave not accurate enough results for predicting pseudoknotted RNA. © 2009 Science Publications.","Bioinformatics; Dynamic programming; NP-complete; Pseudoknots; RNA secondary structure","","","","","","","","Lukavsky P.J., Basic Principles of RNA NMR Spectroscopy.

Many scientists and physicians are working on Brain Projects in different aspects. Capturing and processing human brain images are not an easy tasks. The fact that the Talairach brain fails to match individual scans motivate us to use other type of approaches and algorithms. With using brain anatomy as a source for integrating different types of images, researchers try to segment the human brain in different aspects. By taking advantage of hierarchical clustering algorithm we try to present an effective and more accurate approach for human brain image processing. © 2009 IEEE.","","Brain; Image registration; Medical imaging; Brain anatomy; Explosive growth; Hierarchical clustering algorithms; Human bodies; Human brain; Medical image registration; Medical imaging technology; Clustering algorithms","","","","","","","Jackson B., What's New about Neuroinformatics, (2002); Brinkley J.F., Rosse C., Imaging informatics and the Human Brain Project: The role of structure, pp. 131-148, (2002); Damasio H., Human Brain Anatomy in Computerized Images, (1995); Herskovits E., A Bayesian Morphometry Algorithm, (2001); Hines M.L., Carnevale N.T., Neuron: A Tool for Neuroscientists, The Neuroscientist, 7, pp. 123-135, (2001); Hohne K.H., Pflesser B., Pommert A., Riemer M., Schiemann T., Schubert R., Tiede U., A new representation of knowledge concerning human anatomy and function, Nature Med, 1, 6, pp. 506-511, (1995); Little J.A., Hill D.L.G., Hawkes D.J., Deformations incorporating rigid structures, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 66, 2, pp. 223-232, (1997); Krechel D., Pedroso D., von Wangenheim A., Automatic registration of MRI head volumes using an octreeanatomical atlas, Computer-Based Medical Systems, 60, (1999); Neuroinformatics: An overview of the Human Brain, (1997); Mazziota J.C., Toga A.W., Evans A.C., Fox P., Lancaster J., A Probabilistic Atlas of the Human Brain: Theory and Rationale for its Development, NeuroImage, 2, pp. 89-101, (1995); Mejino J.L.V., Noy N.F., Musen M., Rosse C., Representation of structural relationships in the Foundational Model of Anatomy, Proc AMIA Symp, 2001, (2001); Roland P.E., Zilles K., Brain atlases - a new research tool, Trends in Neurosciences 17, pp. 458-467, (1994); Prothero J.S., Prothero J.W., Three dimentional Reconstruiction from serial sections IV, The Reassembly Proble, 19, 4, pp. 361-373, (1986); Rosse C., Mejino J., Modayur B., Jakobovits R., Hinshaw K., Brinkley J.F., Motivation and Organizational Principles for Anatomical Knowledge Representation: The Digital Anatomist Symbolic Knowledge Base, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 5, 1, pp. 17-40, (1998); Shepherd G.M., Mirsky J.S., Healy M.D., Singer M.S., Skoufos E., Hines M.S., Nadkarni P.M., Miler P.L., Neuroinformatics Tools for Integrating, Searching, and Modeling Multidisciplinary Neuroscience data, (2001); Shepherd G.M., Supporting Databases for Neuroscience Research, Journal of Neuroscience, 22, (2002); Wagner H., Von Wangenheim A., Trevisol- Bittencourt P.C., von Wangenheim C.G., Krechel D., A digital deformable anisotropic brain atlas based on the Talairachatlas and recursive spatial data structures, Computer-Based Medical Systems, 36, (2001); Wilson T., Confocal Microscopy, (1990)","H.

Experimental methods for determining RNA structure are time consuming and tedious; therefore, predictive computational approaches are required. Predicting the most accurate and energy-stable pseudoknot RNA secondary structure has been proven to be an NP-hard problem. In this paper, a new RNA folding approach, termed MSeeker, is presented; it includes KnotSeeker (a heuristic method) and Mfold (a thermo-dynamic algorithm). The global optimization of this thermodynamic heuristic approach was further enhanced by using a case-based reasoning technique as a local optimization method. MSeeker is a proposed algorithm for predicting RNA pseudoknot structure from individual sequences, especially long ones. This research demonstrates that MSeeker improves the sensitivity and specificity of existing RNA pseudoknot structure predictions. The performance and structural results from this proposed method were evaluated against seven other state-of-the-art pseudoknot prediction methods. The MSeeker method had better sensitivity than the DotKnot, FlexStem, HotKnots, pknotsRG, ILM, NUPACK and pknotsRE methods, with 79% of the predicted pseudoknot base-pairs being correct. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Case-based reasoning; Heuristic approach; Pseudoknots; RNA secondary structure; Thermodynamic programming","algorithm; analytic method; article; base pairing; controlled study; intermethod comparison; mathematical computing; prediction; priority journal; process optimization; qualitative analysis; RNA sequence; RNA structure; sensitivity and specificity; structure activity relation; structure analysis; thermodynamics","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (1001/PKOMP/822192, 203/PKOMP/6711136); Universiti Sains Malaysia","This research was partly supported by a Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Fellowship, which was awarded to the corresponding author.
