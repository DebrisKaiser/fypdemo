Extensive experiments were conducted on 14 different domains using Amazon product reviews. Our preliminary findings show that cross-domain CNN models trained with multiple source domains achieved accuracy of above 80% across all the domains and outperform the in-domain models trained using limited labeled data from the same domain. In fact, the cross-domain CNN models demonstrated better performance when a larger number of source domains are used for training. Therefore, going deep and big is a promising direction to explore for cross-domain sentiment classification. © 2020 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; cross-domain sentiment classification; deep learning; product reviews; sentiment analysis","Convolution; Labeled data; Sentiment analysis; Different domains; Multiple domains; Multiple source; Number of sources; Product reviews; Sentiment classification; Target domain; Training data; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (203/PKOMP/67711796); Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6315171)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is made possible partially through the research assistantship from Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia (203/PKOMP/67711796).

The current system causes massive workloads on nurses declining their efficiency in the workplace. Therefore, this study proposes an SMS-based vaccination reminder and management system called Virtual Health Connect (VHC) to assist the health centers by simplifying the management of infants’ immunization records. This study aims to realize influential factors of intention to use VHC among Malaysian health centers by considering the technology acceptance model (TAM) as an underlying theory. The proposed model will be verified using data collected from self-directed questionnaires answered by nurses working in Malaysian government hospitals and government clinics. A research method based on the multi-analytical approach of Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) will refine the results of this research. This study will contribute to the theoretical body of knowledge about influential factors of health centers’ intention to use VHC in Malaysian government health centers by extending the TAM model by adding new variables. The practical contribution of this study will help software developers to develop VHC by considering essential factors that determine health centers to intend to use VHC. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA); SMS-based vaccination reminder and management system Technology acceptance model (TAM); VHC","Computation theory; Immunization; Intelligent computing; Neural networks; Nursing; Regression analysis; Surveys; Analytical approach; Influential factors; Malaysian governments; Management systems; Multiple regression analysis; research methods; Software developer; Technology acceptance model; Vaccines","","","","","","","Domek G.J., Contreras-Roldan I.L., O'Leary S.T., Bull S., Furniss A., Kempe A., Asturias E.J., SMS text message reminders to improve infant vaccination coverage in Guatemala: A pilot randomized controlled trial, Vaccine, 34, 21, pp. 2437-2443, (2016); Kharbanda E.O., Stockwell M.S., Fox H.W., Rickert V.I., Text4Health: A qualitative evaluation of parental readiness for text message immunization reminders, Am.

In automated planning research, the word ""plans"" refers specifically to plans of action. It is about the representation of future behavior, generally a series of action, with temporal and other constraints on them for execution by some agents. Theoretically, planning is an important part of rational behavior. In this study, we review some of the studies that have been conducted in menu planning. It covers the introduction of menu planning, the state of the arts for nutrition care expert systems and the approaches that have been applied. Furthermore, the advantages and limitations of the methods commonly used for menu planning are also highlighted in this study. © 2016 Hea Choon Ngo, Yu-N Cheah, Ong Sing Goh, Yun-Huoy Choo, Halizah Basiron and Yogan Jaya Kumar.","Agents; Automated planning; Constraints; Menu planning; Nutrition care expert systems","","","","","","","","Anderson A.M., Earle M.D., Diet planning in the third world by linear and goal programming, J.

Once it is on production the software application must evolve when new anomalies uncovered or when new user requirement arises. Prior to any software evolution, decision making need to be undertaken by the organization's Software Maintenance Decision Maker (SMDM) whether to proceed with the evolution required and how to proceed with the required maintenance. However, the study on decision making in software maintenance is very limited. Existing researches focus mainly on project management, software effort estimation or decision making on software maintenance policy selection. The uniqueness of this study relies on the ability of knowledge management method to capture the software maintenance knowledge of a software application that is inherent in the Software Application Expert Maintainer (SAEM) mind and software application specification and use it to support the software maintenance analysis phase. It is crucial for the knowledge to be available for the SMDM especially in the event that the expert software maintainer is not available. This study is also able to assist Software Application Beginner Maintainer (SABM) to gain maintenance knowledge of a particular software application that is available in the knowledge-based decision making model. This results in shorter time to learn on how to maintain a software application without the SAEM assistance. This paper proposes an alternative to the SAEM and software application specification knowledge through the Maintenance Decision Making Knowledge-Based (MademKB) Model that can preserve the maintenance knowledge of a software application to support software maintenance decision making. The MADEMKB is evaluated using case study with Malaysian organization. © 2014 IEEE.","decision making model; knowledge management; software maintenance","Application programs; Computer software maintenance; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Project management; Specifications; Decision making models; Knowledge-based decision making; Knowledge-based model; Maintenance decision making; Maintenance decisions; Maintenance policy selections; Software applications; Software effort estimation; Decision making","","","","","","","Software Engineering-Product Quality-Part 1: Quality Model"", (2001); Abran A., Moore J.W., Bourque P., Dupuis R., Guide to software engineering body of knowledge, IEEE Computer Society, (2004); Kruchten P., An ontology of architectural design decisions in software intensive systems, 2nd Groningen Workshop on Software Variability, (2004); Lutters W.G., Seaman C.B., Revealing actual documentation usage in software maintenance through war stories, Information and Software Technology, 49, 6, pp. 576-587, (2007); Pfleeger S.L., Software Engineering Theory and Practice"", (2001); Blair D.C., Knowledge management: Hype, hope, or help?, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 53, 12, pp. 1019-1028, (2002); Holz H., Melnik G., Research on Learning Software Organizations-Past, Present, and Future.

This task aims to extract fine-grained aspects from online customer reviews, which is a challenging task. Most of the early work focused on the extraction of subjective aspects associated with some opinion words but very few have focused on objective aspects. These objective aspects can affect the overall performance of the aspect extraction task resulting in wrong results. In this paper, we proposed a sequential pattern-based approach to detect such aspects which are objective in nature. We defined several sequential patterns, on the basis of word occurrence in a sentence, to detect objective aspects. The experimental evaluation demonstrated significant improvement in the aspect extraction phase by pruning such aspects which are objective in nature. © 2016 IEEE.","aspect pruning; aspect-based sentiment analysis; objective aspects; sequential patterns","Data mining; Feature extraction; Natural language processing systems; aspect pruning; Experimental evaluation; Extraction phase; objective aspects; Online customer reviews; Sentiment analysis; Sequential patterns; Subjective aspects; Extraction","","","","","School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","The authors would like to thank the School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia for supporting the publication of this paper.

Once it is on production the information system must evolve due to the operating environment changes, when new anomalies uncovered or when new user requirement arises. Prior to any software evolution, decision-making need to be undertaken by the organization's IT decision makers whether to proceed with the evolution required, if yes on how to proceed with the required maintenance. However, the study on decision making in software maintenance is very limited, existing research focus mainly on project management. The uniqueness of this study relies on the ability of knowledge engineering method to capture the software maintenance knowledge of an information system that is inherent in the software expert's mind, documentation and code. This uses the concept of expert system to record the knowledge of the information system in a knowledge base and inference logic to analyst the recorded knowledge. The analysis is carried out using heuristic and inference logic pre-programmed into the expert-based framework. This is crucial especially to assist IT decision makers in determining whether it is possible to incorporate an additional requirement into a running system within an acceptable timeframe without the presence of a software expert in question. The framework is tested by proof of concept with a real life application of an organization. © 2013 IEEE.","decision support; expert system; knowledge engineering; software maintenance","Computer circuits; Computer software; Computer software maintenance; Decision support systems; Expert systems; Information use; Knowledge engineering; Project management; Decision makers; Decision supports; Operating environment; Proof of concept; Real-life applications; Running systems; Software Evolution; User requirements; Decision making","","","","","","","Lawry R., Waddell D., Singh M., Roles, responsibilities and futures of chief information officers (cios) in the public sector, Proceedings of European and Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems (EMCIS), (2007); Feigenbaum E.A., McCorduck P., The Fifth Generation: Artificial Intelligence & Japan's Computer Challenge to the World, (1983); Soumitra D., Knowledge Processing & Applied Artificial Intelligence, (1993); Bjornson F.O., Dingsoyr T., Knowledge management in software engineering: A systematic review of studied concepts, findings and research methods used, Information and Software Technology, (2008); Ramsey S.D., Ntuen C.A., Satorc: A system analysis tool for reengineering complex systems, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 33, pp. 179-183, (1997); Edberg D., Ivanova P., Kuechler W., Methodology mashups: An exploration of processes used to maintain software, Journal of Management Information Systems, 28, 4, pp. 271-304, (2012); Martel R.J., Sudano J.J., Information optimization for decisionmaking, Aerospace and Electronics Conference, 1997.

Huge computational costs for training new embeddings from scratch have made pretrained word embeddings such as Word2Vec and Glove popular for reuse of word vectors. Inadequacy of a single embedding necessitated newer techniques to combine two embeddings. However, the combined embeddings proposed in existing works are static and only provide a one-size-fits-all solution regardless of the problem and dataset at hand. Optimization is a more promising technique to overcome the limitations of simplistic techniques in existing works related to combined word embeddings because optimization provides unique and optimal solutions according to the problem and dataset at hand. In this paper, a new genetic algorithm based combinatorial optimization algorithm called Evolutionary Combinatorial Optimization for Word Embedding (ECOWE) is proposed to produce combinations of word embeddings, which yield optimal accuracy for the specific sentiment classification dataset that is used. Results show that absolute percentages of improvement ranging from 1.7% to 12.9%, averaging around 5.5% and relative percentages of improvement ranging from 2.4% to 19.5%, averaging around 8.1% have been achieved over the benchmark model accuracy values for all datasets. The ECOWE accuracy values for all datasets have also been found to be statistically significant compared to benchmark accuracy values with a z-score of -2.2014 using two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test with 5% significance level. © 2019.

A variety of approaches have been used for extracting ADR from social/medical reviews. These approaches include machine learning, dictionary-based and statistical approaches. Yet, these approaches showed either a high dependency on using an external knowledge source for ADR detection or relying on domain-dependent mechanisms that might lose contextual information. This study aims to propose word sequencing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. A benchmark dataset of MedSyn has been used in the experiments. Then, a word indexing, mapping, and padding method have been used to represent the words within the reviews as fixed sequences. Such sequences have been fed into the LSTM consequentially. Experimental results showed that the proposed LSTM could achieve an F1 score of up to 92%. Comparing such a finding to the baseline studies reveals the superiority of LSTM. The demonstration of the efficacy of the proposed method has taken different forms including the examination of word indexing with different classifiers, the examination of different features with LSTM, and through the comparison against the baseline studies. © 2023.","adverse drug reaction extraction; long short-term memory; mapping; word; word embedding; word indexing","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","This study has been supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia.","Denecke K., Deng Y., Sentiment analysis in medical settings: New opportunities and challenges, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 64, 1, pp. 17-27, (2015); Lafontaine F., Sivadasan J., The recent evolution of physical retail markets: Online retailing, big box stores, and the rise of restaurants, The Role of Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Economic Growth, (2020); Diaz G.

This is to look at the public perceptions expressed in the reviews. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) deemed to receive a set of texts (e.g., product reviews or online reviews) and identify the opinion-target (aspect) within each review. Contemporary aspect-based sentiment analysis systems, like the aspect categorization, rely predominantly on lexicon-based, or manually labelled seeds that is being incorporated into the topic models. And using either handcrafted rules or pre-labelled clues for performing implicit aspect detection. These constraints are restricted to a particular domain or language which is domain-dependent. In this work, we first propose a novel unsupervised probabilistic model Topic-seeds Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TSLDA) that leverages semantic regularities for the articulation of explicit aspect-categories. Then, based on the articulated categories, a distributed vector is used for the identification of implicit aspects. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms baseline methods for different domain-data with minimal configurations. Specifically, utilizing the RI measure, our proposed TSLDA outperformed multiple clustering and topic models by an average of 0.83% in diverse domain-data, and roughly 0.89% using the Precision metric for implicit aspect detection. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Aspect categorization; Implicit aspects; Sampling algorithm; Topic modelling; Topic-seeds; Word embedding","Semantics; Statistics; Aspect categorization; Embeddings; Implicit aspect; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Sampling algorithm; Sentiment analysis; Topic Modeling; Topic-seed; Web 2.0; Word embedding; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Najmi E., Hashmi K., Malik Z., Et al., CAPRA: a comprehensive approach to product ranking using customer reviews, Computing, 97, pp. 843-867, (2015); Liu W., Jing W., Li Y., Incorporating feature representation into BiLSTM for deceptive review detection, Computing, 102, pp. 701-715, (2020); Liu B., Many Facets of Sentiment Analysis.

This may lead to missed appointments, incomplete vaccinations, and outbreaks of preventable diseases among infants. To address this issue, a text messaging vaccination reminder and recall system named Virtual Health Connect (VHC) was studied. VHC simplifies and accelerates immunization administration for nurses, which may result in improving the completion and timeliness of immunizations among infants. Considering the limited research on the acceptance of these systems in the healthcare sector, we examined the factors influencing nurses’ attitudes and intentions to use VHC using the extended technology acceptance model (TAM). The novelty of the conceptual model is the incorporation of new predictors of attitude, namely, perceived compatibility and perceived privacy and security issues. We conducted a survey among 121 nurses in Malaysian government hospitals and clinics to test the model. We analyzed the collected data using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the significant factors influencing nurses’ attitudes and intentions to use VHC. Moreover, we applied an artificial neural network (ANN) to determine the most significant factors of acceptance with higher accuracy. Therefore, we could offer more accurate insights to decision-makers in the healthcare sector for the advancement of health services. Our results highlighted that the compatibility of VHC with the current work setting of nurses developed their positive perspectives on the system. Moreover, the nurses felt optimistic about the system when they considered it useful and easy to use in the workplace. Finally, their attitude toward using VHC played a pivotal role in increasing their intention to use it. Based on the ANN models, we also found that perceived compatibility was the most significant factor influencing nurses’ attitudes towards using VHC, followed by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial neural network; nurses’ acceptance; nurses’ attitudes and intentions; technology acceptance model; text messaging vaccination reminder and recall system","accuracy; Article; artificial neural network; attitude; back propagation; cross validation; data analysis; decision making; discriminant validity; exploratory factor analysis; feed forward neural network; health care cost; health service; health survey; human; immunization; internal consistency; Malaysia; model; partial least squares regression; questionnaire; recall; sampling; sensitivity analysis; structural equation modeling; structural model; technology acceptance model; text messaging; vaccination; varimax rotation; workplace","","","","","","","Ooi K.S., Cheah Y.-N., Virtual Health Connect: A Community-Based Immunisation Scheduler and Manager, Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Computing and Informatics (ICOCI 2013); Domek G.J., Contreras-Roldan I.L., O'Leary S.T., Bull S., Furniss A., Kempe A., Asturias E.J., SMS text message reminders to improve infant vaccination coverage in Guatemala: A pilot randomized controlled trial, Vaccine, 34, pp. 2437-2443, (2016); Mekonnen Z.A., Tilahun B., Alemu K., Were M., Effect of mobile phone text message reminders on improving completeness and timeliness of routine childhood vaccinations in North-West, Ethiopia: A study protocol for randomised controlled trial, BMJ Open, 9, (2019); Mekonnen Z.A., Gelaye K.A., Were M.C., Tilahun B., Timely completion of vaccination and its determinants among children in northwest, Ethiopia: A multilevel analysis, BMC Public Health, 20, (2020); Malaysia Immunization Profile.

The featured work leverages intelligent agents and medical ontologies for autonomous HEM-wide navigation, approximate content matching, inter- and intra-repositories content correlation and information adaptation to meet the user's information request. We anticipate that the use of IHIA will empower healthcare stakeholders to actively communicate with an 'information/knowledge- rich' HEM and will be able to retrieve with ease 'useful' task-specific information via the presentation of cognitively intuitive queries.","","Internet; Malaysia; Medical Informatics; Nova Scotia; User-Computer Interface; Autonomous agents; Health care; Information retrieval systems; Intelligent agents; Knowledge management; Metals; Content correlations; Dynamic information; Empirical knowledge; Experiential knowledge; Explicit knowledge; Information repositories; Information request; Specific information; article; Canada; computer interface; Internet; Malaysia; medical informatics; Information filtering","","","","","","","Await D., Lawton B., Data warehousing: Back to basics, SQL Server Magazine, (2000); Abecker A., Bernardi A., Hinkelmann K., Kuhn O., Sintek M., Toward a technology for organizational memories, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 13, 3, pp. 40-48, (1998); Cheah N.Y., Abidi S.S.R., Healthcare knowledge management through building and operationalizing healthcare enterprise memory, Fifteenth International Congress, Medical Informatics Europe (MIE '99), (1999); Aamodt A., Plaza E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational Issues, methodological variations, and system approaches, Al Communications, 7, 1, pp. 39-59, (1994); Cheah N.Y., Abidi S.S.R., Augmenting knowledge-based medical systems with tacit healthcare expertise: Towards an intelligent tacit knowledge acquisition info-structure, Fourteenth IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS 2 0 0 1 ), (2001); Wooldridge M., Jennings N.R., Intelligent agents: Theory and practice, Knowledge Engineering Review, 10, 2, (1995); Hendler J., Making sense out of agents, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 14, 2, pp. 32-37, (1999); Cabri G., Leonardi L., Zambonelli F., Mobile-agent coordination models for internet applications, IEEE Computer, 33, 2, pp. 82-89, (2000); Lentini R., Rao G., Thies J., Kay J., EMAA: An Extendable Mobile Agent Architecture, Fifteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI '98), (1998); Mills C., Heaps C., An Inverted-Index-Based Text-Search Engine, (1996); Arshadi N., Badie K., A compositional approach to solution adaptation in case-based reasoning and its application to tutoring library, Eighth German Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning (GWCBR2000), (2000); Abidi S.S.R., Yeoh C.K., An autonomous intelligent system leveraging case based reasoning techniques to dynamically compose personalized health maintenance information, First International NAISO Congress on A U T O N O M O U S Intelligent Systems (ICAIS 2002), (2002); Gruber T.R., A translation approach to portable ontologies, Knowledge Acquisition, 5, 2","","","IOS Press","","17th International Conference of the European Federation of Medical Informatics, MIE 2002","25 August 2002 through 29 August 2002","Budapest","","09269630","1586032798; 978-158603279-1","","2004176268","English","Stud.

To the best of the researchers' knowledge, nostudies have tested samples of text with letter repetition usingsentiment tools. The main aim of this paper is to investigatewhether letter repetition in product reviews are perceived tohave any sentiment value, based on ratings by individualparticipants and analyses using sentiment tools. This studycollected and analysed 1,041 consumer reviews in the form ofonline comments using the UCREL Wmatrix system, andsimulated emotional words within the comments to containrepeated letters. A group of 500 participants rated 15 positivecomments and 15 negative comments and their respectivesimulated counterparts, while 32 sentiment tools are used toanalyse a pair of positive comment and its simulated counterpartand a pair of negative comment and its simulated counterpart.Results indicate that readers perceive letter repetition to amplifya comment's sentiment value, in which the effect was foundmore strongly in negative comments than positive comments.On the other hand, analyses using sentiment tools show that amajority of these tools are unable to detect letter repetitionwithin a word and instead, treats the word as a spelling mistake.As consumers or online users, in general, have been found to useletter repetition to intensify and express their sentiments in theircomments, this study's findings suggest that letter repetitionprocessing in any text-based mechanism needs to be enhanced.The outcome of this paper is useful for improving themeasurement of sentiment analysis for the use of marketingapplications. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

Data-mediated knowledge discovery, especially from multiple heterogeneous data resources, is a tedious process and imposes significant operational constraints on end-users. We demonstrate that autonomous, reactive and proactive intelligent agents provide an opportunity to generate end-user oriented, packaged, value-added decision-support/strategic planning services for professionals, managers and policy makers of an organization, without the need for a priori technical knowledge. Since effective progress of an organization is grounded in good communication, experience sharing, continuous learning and proactive actions, we present an Agent-based Data Mining Info-structure (ADMI) that deploys a suite of Data Mining (DM) algorithms coupled with intelligent agents to facilitate data access, DM query specification, DM algorithm selection and DM result visualisation - i.e. automated generation of data-mediated decision-support/strategic-planning services.","Agents; Data mining and Healthcare; Multiagent methodology; Multiagent systems","Computer architecture; Data mining; Decision support systems; Distributed database systems; Health care; Intelligent agents; Knowledge based systems; Strategic planning; Agent based data mining into-structure (ADMI); Knowledge sharing; Multiagent methodology; Multi agent systems","","","","","","","Abidi S.S.R., Y-N, A convergence of knowledge management and data mining: Towards 'knopwledge driven' strategic services, 3rd Int.

Coalition formation is an approach dedicated to achieve optimal group arrangement. We are working in the direction of identifying strategies to build a coalition formation system taking into consideration the social factors. Computational cultural dynamics (CCD) is a research area that intertwines computer technology with behavioural and social sciences. We find that this research has potential to be further expanded to study and build a group setting. At the same time, the value of knowledge is seen as an important factor to determine the success of such coalition especially from the social aspect. Therefore, with the motivation to achieve a CCD perspective of a knowledge based coalition formation, social factors are studied, where the knowledge derived from this process will be identified, represented and stored. In this paper, we present a framework for the knowledge based coalition formation focusing on structuring the social factors chosen to initiate the knowledge process of the coalition formation system. © 2010 IEEE.","Coaltion formation; Knowledge management; Ontology; Social factors","Information technology; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Ontology; Social aspects; Coalition formations; Coaltion formation; Collaborative teams; Computer technology; Knowledge process; Research areas; Social factor; Specific tasks; Knowledge representation","","","","","","","Housel T., Bell A.H., Measuring and Managing Knowledge, (2001); Turban E., Aronson J.E., Decision Support Systems and Intelligent Systems, (2001); Awadand E.M., Ghaziri H.M., Knowledge Management, (2004); Nau D., Wilkenfeld J., Computational cultural dynamics, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 23, 4, pp. 18-19, (2008); Marwick A.D., Knowledge management technology, IBM Systems Journal: Knowledge Management, 40, 4, pp. 814-830, (2001); Thomas J.C., Kellogg W.A., Erickson T., The knowledge management puzzle: Human and social factors in knowledge management, IBM Systems Journal: Knowledge Management, 40, 4, pp. 863-884, (2001); Von Neumann J., Morgenstern O., Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour, (1953); Konishi H., Ray D., Coalition formation as a dynamic process, Journal of Economic Theory, 110, pp. 1-41, (2003); Chong Y.H., Cheah Y.N., Credibility-chart and dual-memory referencing for robust and efficient agent search in coalition formation, Proceedings of International Conference on Intelligent Knowledge Systems, (2004); Gamson W.A., A theory of coalition formation, American Sociological Review, 26, 3, pp. 373-382, (1961); Hanneman R.A., Riddle M., Introduction to Social Network Methods; Wellman B., Berkowitz S.D., Social Structures: A Network Approach, (1998); Baninajarian N., Abdullah Z., Groups in context: A model of group effectiveness, European Journal of Social Sciences, 8, 2, pp. 335-340, (2009); Klusch M., Gerber A., Dynamic coalition formation among rational agents, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 17, 3, pp. 42-47, (2002); Chong Y.H., Cheah Y.N., Forming cohesive coalitions using virtual social network and adaptive resonance theory, IADIS International Conference e-Society 2005, pp. 651-655, (2005); Allsopp D.N., Beautement P., Kirton M., Bradshaw J.M., Suri N., Durfee E.H., Knoblock C.A., Tate A., Thompson C.W., Coalition agents experiment: Multiagent cooperation in international coalitions, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 17, 3, pp. 26-35, (2002); Marmelstein R.E., Force templates: A blueprint for coalition interaction within an infosphere, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 17, 3, pp. 36-41, (2002); Pechoucek M., Marik V., Barta J., Guest Editors' introduction: A knowledge-based approach to coalition formation, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 17, 3, pp. 14-16, (2002); Reffay C., Chanier T., How social network analysis can help to measure cohesion in collaborative distance learning, Proceedings of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning, pp. 343-352, (2003); Macy M.W., Willer R., From factors to actors: Computational sociology and agent-based modeling, Annual Review of Sociology, 28, pp. 143-166, (2002); Gabora L., Modeling cultural dynamics, Proceedings of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Fall Symposium, pp. 18-25, (2008); Harvey C.M., Koubek R.J., Cognitive, social and environment attributes of distributed engineering collaboration: A review and proposed model of collaboration, Human Factors and Ergonomics in Manufacturing, 10, 4, pp. 369-393, (2000); Sicilia M.A., Lytras M., Rodriguez E., Garcia- Barriocanal E., Integrating descriptions of knowledge management learning activities into large ontological structures: A case study, Data & Knowledge Engineering, 57, 2, pp. 111-121, (2006); Gruber T.R., A translation approach to portable ontology specifications, Knowledge Acquisition, 5, 2, pp. 199-220, (1993); Vasconcelos J., Kimble C., Gouveia F., Kudenko D., A group memory system for corporate knowledge management, an ontological approach, Proceedings of the 1st European Conference on Knowledge Management (ECKM'2000), pp. 91-99, (2000); Keyton J., Communicating in Groups: Building Relationships in Groups; Peeters M.A.G., Van Tuijl H.F.J.M., Rutte C.G., Reymen I.M.M.J., Personality and team performance: A meta-analysis, European Journal of Personality, 20, 5, pp. 377-396, (2006); Hashim I.H.M., The development of social network at workplace for new teachers, Kajian Malaysia, 12, 2, (2004); Yao H., Orme A.M., Etzkorn L., Cohesion metrics for ontology design and application, Journal of Computer Science, 1, 1, pp. 107-113, (2005)","","","","IEEE","2010 International Symposium on Information Technology, ITSim'10","15 June 2010 through 17 June 2010","Kuala Lumpur","81915","","978-142446718-1","","","English","Proc.

Furthermore, current planning systems are often static. Therefore, in this paper, we present a portable and intuitively easy plan representation that facilitates the storage and manipulation of generic plans for dynamic planning. Our plan ontology and representation also takes into account the possible application of planning in grid architectures and environments. Our plan ontology adopts and incorporates elements of current plan ontologies and representations, especially the Asbru plan ontology, and Goals-Operators-Methods-Selection (GOMS) analysis. It also maintains a hierarchical structuring of the plan ontology. We believe our plan ontology is reasonably economical and would make dynamic planning more efficient.","Dynamic plan; Generic plan; Plan ontology","Knowledge engineering; Planning; Dynamic plan; Dynamic planning; Fine grained; Generic plan; Grid architectures; Hierarchical structuring; Plan ontology; Planning systems; Ontology","","","","","","","Tate A., A Plan Ontology - A Working Document, Proceedings of the Workshop on Ontology Development and Use, (1994); Gil Y., Blythe J., PLANET: A Shareable and Reusable Ontology for Representing Plans, AAAI 2000 Workshop on Representational Issues for Real-World Planning Systems, (2000); Lever J., Richards B., Guide to the Generic Planning Architecture, ESPRIT Deliverable for Constraint Handling in Industry and Commerce (CHIC), (1995); Shahar Y., Miksch S., Johnson P., A Task-Specific Ontology for Design and Execution of Time-Oriented Skeletal Plans, Tenth Knowledge Acquisition for Knowledge-Based Systems Workshop, (1996); Jonassen D., Tessmer M., Hannum W., Task Analysis Methods for Instructional Design, (1999)","","","","","2005 International Conference on Information and Knowledge Engineering, IKE'05","20 June 2005 through 23 June 2005","Las Vegas, NV","75417","","978-193241581-0","","","English","Proc.

The team formation algorithm is designed in a way that it would continuously search for resources with better performance and pool resources together to achieve better availability. The main intention of this work is not to replace the human administrators but to provide a better alternative in managing services in dynamic distributed environment. Instructions from the administrators are still required but at a different level. Administrators are freed from making low level decisions such as to decide the actual placement of the services and design the failover capabilities for each of the services. The evaluation results showed that the framework is capable of managing resources according to the requirements given by administrator, even during in the event of multiple consecutive resources failure. The proposed solution had the probability of 72.1% of its services that are still available after 83.3% of the available resources were shut down while conventional failover solution using three redundant units had only the probability of 40.8% of services that are still available. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

As these software age, they have to be maintained to suit the demands of the users. There are many challenges involved in maintaining this software which decision makers in the software reengineering community have to address. These decision makers need an expert's assistance in reengineering the software. Many studies attempt to support decision makers. However, there is limited study in adopting artificial intelligence approaches to support the decision-making process. Hence, we introduce an expert-based decision support framework called REXDES that can analyze different components of a software application to facilitate decision-making in software reengineering. © 2011 IEEE.","decision makers; decision support; expert system; software reengineering","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Expert systems; Reengineering; Decision makers; Decision making process; Decision supports; Expert-based decisions; Software applications; software reengineering; Software engineering","","","","","","","John M., David C., Cheryl J., Beth L., Elizabeth C., Jose D., Practical Software Measurement: Objective Information for Decision Makers, (2001); Vliet H., Software Engineering Principles and Practice, (2008); Pfleeger S.L., Software Engineering Theory and Practice, (2001); Lawry R., Waddell D., Singh M., Roles, responsibilities and futures of chief information officers (CIOS) in the public sector, Proceedings of European and Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems (EMCIS), 2007; Martel R.J., Sudano J.J., Information optimization for decision-making, Aerospace and Electronics Conference, 1997.

A fold refers to the combination of training data subset and test data subset splits for training and validating machine learning models. Every fold would yield a certain accuracy value for the model. In the case of 10 fold cross validation, the overall accuracy is estimated by averaging the accuracy values produced by all 10 folds. For any dataset which contains a certain number of instances, there are many possible combinations of train-test data splits that could be generated. This implies that the train-test splitting process in cross validation can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. The set of all possible train-test splits for a dataset form an evolutionary search space. In existing works, genetic algorithm based feature selection formulates the problem of feature subset selection as a combinatorial optimization problem. The objective of those works is to identify the most optimal feature subset which yields the best model accuracy. Apart from feature subsets, train-test splits or folds also influence model accuracy. Using different folds for training a model would result in varying ranges of accuracy. Out of all possible folds in the search space, a specific set of folds could yield optimal accuracy just like in the case of genetic algorithm based feature subset selection. This work proposes an evolutionary cross validation algorithm for identifying optimal folds in a dataset to improve predictive modeling accuracy. Results of experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets suggest that the proposed algorithm provides significant improvement against the baseline 10 fold cross validation. © 2017 IEEE.","Cross Validation; Evolutionary Computation; Genetic Algorithm; Machine Learning","Artificial intelligence; Combinatorial optimization; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Set theory; Statistical tests; Testing; 10-fold cross-validation; Combinatorial optimization problems; Cross validation; Cross validation algorithms; Cross-validation methods; Experimental evaluation; Feature subset selection; Machine learning models; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","","","","Refaeilzadeh P., Tang L., Liu H., Cross validation, Encyclopedia of Database Systems, pp. 532-538, (2009); Kohavi R., A study of cross-validation and bootstrap for accuracy estimation and model selection, Proc.

Therefore, feature extraction (FE) plays a vital role in topic classification in particular and text mining in general. FE based on cosine similarity score is commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets with tens or hundreds of thousands of features, which can be impossible to process further. In this study, TF-IDF term weighting is used to extract features. Selecting relevant features and determining how to encode them for a learning machine method have a vast impact on the learning machine methods ability to extract a good model. Two different weighting methods (TF-IDF and TF-IDF Global) were used and tested on the Reuters-21578 text categorization test collection. The obtained results emerged a good candidate for enhancing the performance of English topics FE. Simulation results the Reuters-21578 text categorization show the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.","cosine similarity score; feature extraction; TF-IDF weighting; topic classification","Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Text processing; Cosine similarity; High dimensionality; Learning machines; Relevant features; Text categorization; TF-IDF weighting; Topic Classification; Weighting methods; Data mining","","","","","","","Ayache S., Quenot G., Gensel J., Classifier Fusion for SVM-based Multimedia Semantic Indexing, pp. 494-504, (2007); Sadiq A.T., Abdullah S.M., Hybrid intelligent technique for text categorization, IEEE, pp. 238-245, (2012); Benfriha H., Barigou F., Atmani B., Lattice-cell: Hybrid Approach for Text Categorization, pp. 1311-4151, (2013); Metzler D., Dumais S., Meek C., Similarity Measures for Short Segments of Text., pp. 6-27, (2007); Forman G., An extensive empirical study of feature selection metrics for text classification, The Journal of Machine Learning, 3, pp. 1289-1305, (2003); Soucy P., Mineau G.W., Beyond TFIDF weighting for text categorization in the vector space model, IJCAI, 5, pp. 1130-1135, (2005); Turney P.D., Pantel P., From frequency to meaning: Vector space models of semantics, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 37, 1, pp. 141-188, (2010); Ikonomakis M., Kotsiantis S., Tampakas V., Text classification using machine learning techniques, WSEAS Transactions on Computers, 4, 8, pp. 966-974, (2005); Kamruzzaman S.M., Haider F., A Hybrid Learning Algorithm for Text Classification, pp. 1009-4574, (2010); Shi K., Et al., Efficient text classification method based on improved term reduction and term weighting, The Journal of China Universities of Posts and Telecommunications, 18, pp. 131-135, (2011); Debole F., Sebastiani F., Supervised term weighting for automated text categorization, Text Mining and Its Applications, pp. 81-97, (2004); Ramasundaram S., Victor S.P., Text categorization by backpropagation network, International Journal of Computer Applications, 8, 6, pp. 1-5, (2010)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2014 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development, SCOReD 2014","16 December 2014 through 17 December 2014","Penang","111760","","978-147996428-4","","","English","IEEE Stud.

Companies ask their customers to review products and services offered by them over their websites. For the big companies, the number of reviews could be in the thousands. So it is almost impossible for any company to read these reviews manually and find out whether customers liked their product or not. Many techniques have been proposed for sentiment classification of reviews. In this paper we are proposing rulebased hybrid approach which exploits sequential patterns and normalized Google distance (NGD) to extract explicit as well as implicit aspects. For grouping synonyms, we are proposing Google similarity distance in conjunction with particle swarm optimization (PSO). © 2015 IEEE.","Aspect extraction; Aspect level sentiment analysis; Grouping synonyms; NGD; Sequential patterns","Big data; Extraction; Metadata; Natural language processing systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Semantics; Grouping synonyms; Normalized Google distances; Products and services; Rule-based approach; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Sequential patterns; Similarity distance; Sales","","","","","","","Liu B., Sentiment analysis and opinion mining, Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies, 5, 1, pp. 1-167, (2012); Pang B., Lee L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis, Foundations and trends in information retrieval, 2, 1-2, pp. 1-135, (2008); Hu M., Liu B., Mining and summarizing customer reviews, Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 168-177, (2004); Pei J., Han J., Mortazavi-Asl B., Wang J., Pinto H., Chen Q., Dayal U., Hsu M.-C., Mining sequential patterns by pattern-growth: The prefixspan approach,"" Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on, 16, 11, pp. 1424-1440, (2004); Cilibrasi R., Vitanyi P., Automatic Meaning Discovery using Google, (2004); Cilibrasi R.L., Vitanyi P.M., The google similarity distance, Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on, 19, 3, pp. 370-383, (2007); Kennedy J., Particle swarm optimization, Encyclopedia of Machine Learning, pp. 760-766, (2010); Popescu A.-M., Etzioni O., Extracting product features and opinions from reviews, Natural language processing and text mining, pp. 9-28, (2007); Liu K., Xu L., Zhao J., Opinion target extraction using word-based translation model, Proceedings of the 2012 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning, pp. 1346-1356, (2012); Bagheri A., Saraee M., De Jong F., An unsupervised aspect detection model for sentiment analysis of reviews, Natural Language Processing and Information Systems, pp. 140-151, (2013); Poria S., Cambria E., Ku L.-W., Gui C., Gelbukh A., A rule-based approach to aspect extraction from product reviews, SocialNLP, 2014, (2014); Qiu G., Liu B., Bu J., Chen C., Opinion word expansion and target extraction through double propagation, Computational linguistics, 37, 1, pp. 9-27, (2011); Zhang L., Liu B., Lim S.H., O'Brien-Strain E., Extracting and ranking product features in opinion documents, Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on computational linguistics: Posters, pp. 1462-1470, (2010); Kobayashi N., Inui K., Matsumoto Y., Extracting aspect-evaluation and aspect-of relations in opinion mining, EMNLP-CoNLL, pp. 1065-1074, (2007); Jin W., Ho H.H., Srihari R.K., Opinionminer: A novel machine learning system for web opinion mining and extraction, Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, pp. 1195-1204, (2009); Choi Y., Cardie C., Hierarchical sequential learning for extracting opinions and their attributes, Proceedings of the ACL 2010 Conference Short Papers, pp. 269-274, (2010); Zeng L., Li F., A classification-based approach for implicit feature identification, Chinese Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing Based on Naturally Annotated Big Data, pp. 190-202, (2013); Hai Z., Chang K., Kim J.-J., Implicit feature identification via cooccurrence association rule mining, Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing, pp. 393-404, (2011); Carenini G., Ng R.T., Zwart E., Extracting knowledge from evaluative text, Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Knowledge capture, pp. 11-18, (2005); Zhai Z., Liu B., Wang J., Xu H., Jia P., Product feature grouping for opinion mining, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 27, 4, pp. 37-44, (2012); Zhai Z., Liu B., Xu H., Jia P., Clustering product features for opinion mining, Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining, pp. 347-354, (2011)","","Mit E.; Tiong W.K.; Ujir H.; Iskandar D.N.A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9th International Conference on IT in Asia, CITA 2015","4 August 2015 through 5 August 2015","Sarawak, Kuching","118747","","978-147999939-2","","","English","Int.

Specifically, the Modified micro Genetic Algorithm (MmGA) is used to form the ensemble optimizer. The aim of the MmGA-based ensemble optimizer is two-fold, i.e. to select a small number of input features for classification and to improve the classification performances of neural network models. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a number of benchmark problems are first used, and the results are compared with those from other methods. The applicability of the proposed system to a human motion detection and classification task is then evaluated. The outcome positively demonstrates that the proposed MmGA-based ensemble optimizer is able to improve the classification performances of neural network models with a smaller number of input features. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Ensemble models; Evolutionary algorithm; Feature selection; Multi-objective optimization; Neural network classifiers","Feature extraction; Multiobjective optimization; Classification performance; Classification tasks; Ensemble models; Feature selection and classification; Human motion detection; Micro genetic algorithm; Multi-objective evolutionary; Neural network classifier; accelerometer; adult; article; artificial neural network; child; classification; classifier; evolutionary algorithm; feature selection; human; human experiment; information processing; machine learning; modified micro genetic algorithm; priority journal; process optimization; quality control; Evolutionary algorithms","","","","","","","Langley P., Simon H.A., Applications of machine learning and rule induction, Commun.

Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia","This paper introduces a new stem concatenation method to improve Malay large vocabulary speech recognition system based on linguistic knowledge. Malay language is one of the agglutinative languages that form new words using various linguistic stems. This has caused the hypothesized texts to contain a number of floating stems. The proposed method concatenates these floating stems with the base words using Malay linguistic knowledge. The proposed method on Malay LVCSR for smaller training size of 11 thousands sentences can reduce the word error rate by 0.3%. The positive improvements are consistent for all tested different smoothing methods and training transcription sizes. ©2010 IEEE.","Agglutinative language; Language modeling; Linguistic stem; LVCSR; Speech recognition","Computational linguistics; Continuous speech recognition; Innovation; Vocabulary control; Agglutinative language; Language modeling; Large vocabulary continuous speech recognition; Large vocabulary speech recognition; Linguistic knowledge; LVCSR; Smoothing methods; Training size; Word error rate; Engineering research","","","","","","","Karim N.S., Onn F.M., Musa H.Hj., Mahmood A.H., Tatabahasa Dewan, (2006); Ranaivo-Malancon B., Computational Analysis of Affixed Words in Malay Language; Zahid I., Omar M.S., Fonetik Dan Fonologi, (2006); Chen S.F., Goodman J., An Empirical Study of Smoothing Techniques for Language Modeling, (1998); Tan T.-P., Xiao X., Tang E.K., Chng E.S., Li H., MASS: A Malay language LVCSR corpus resource, 2009 Oriental COCOSDA International Conference on Speech Database and Assessment, 10-12 August 2009, pp. 25-30","H.

In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge creation strategy, together with its computational implementation, to (a) capture tacit knowledge possessed by domain experts in an enterprise; and (b) crystallize the captured tacit knowledge so that it can be added to the enterprise's existing knowledge info-structures for usage by front-end enterprise information or knowledge systems. The formulation of the strategy purports a synergy between artificial intelligence techniques for representation, reasoning and learning purposes, with existing concepts and practices in knowledge management.","Enterprise information systems; Knowledge creation; Knowledge management; Scenario representation structure; Tacit knowledge","Artificial intelligence; Information management; Knowledge management; Artificial intelligence techniques; Computational implementations; Enterprise information system; Enterprise knowledge management; Knowledge creations; Knowledge resource; Knowledge system; Tacit knowledge; Information systems","","","","","","","Boisot M., Knowledge Assets: Securing Competitive Advantage in the Information Economy, (1998); O'Leary D., Enterprise knowledge management, IEEE Computer, 31, 3, pp. 54-61, (1998); Duhon B., It's all in our heads, Inform, 12, 8, pp. 8-13, (1998); Nonaka I., Takeuchi H., The Knowledge-Creating Company, (1995); Polanyi M., Personal Knowledge: Towards A Post-Critical Philosophy, (1974); Cheah Y.-N., Abidi S.S.R., A scenario-mediated approach for tacit knowledge acquisition and crystallisation: Towards higher return-on-knowledge and experience, 3rd International Conference on Practical Aspects of Knowledge Management (PAKM 2000), (2000); Speel P.-H., Shadbolt N., De Vries W., Van Dam P.H., Knowledge mapping for industrial purposes, 12th Workshop on Knowledge Acquisition, Modeling and Management (KAW '99), (1999); Potts C., Takahashi K., Anton A., Inquiry-based scenario analysis of system requirements, International Conference on Requirements Engineering (ICRE '94), (1994); Tecuci G., Building knowledge bases through multistrategy learning and knowledge acquisition, Machine Learning and Knowledge Acquisition: Integrated Approaches, (1995)","","Filipe J.; Sharp B.; Pakstas A.; Miranda P.","ICEIS Press","Caixa Geral de Depositos; Conduset; et al.; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia; IBM; Portucel","3rd International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, ICEIS 2001","7 July 2001 through 10 July 2001","Setubal","121766","","9729805024; 978-972980502-8","","","English","ICEIS - Proc.

It is used to reduce the high-dimensional set of features in any dataset by eliminating irrelevant, redundant, and noisy features that are unnecessary from the classification point of view, since it makes it difficult for classifiers or machine learning techniques to produce correct classification results. This research work has accomplished a twofold objective to achieve these goals. Firstly, it aimed to select top-N features with the highest-ranking features using the Information Gain (IG) filter approach. Secondly, it intended to reduce the text feature set obtained by IG using the gray wolf optimizer (GWO) search strategies in the wrapper approach to finding the most informative subset of text features. The Naive Bayes (NB) classifier was introduced to evaluate the performance of this proposed method. Experimentations were carried out on nine benchmark document datasets. Based on the evaluation measures, the results show that the IG-GWO could be used as an alternative method to address the text FS problem compared to the state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms.  © 2021 IEEE.","Binary Gray Wolf Optimizer; Feature Selection; Hybrid Filter-Wrapper Methods; Information Gain; Text Classification","Barium compounds; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Sodium compounds; Text processing; Binary gray wolf optimizer; Features selection; Filter wrappers; Gray wolves; Hybrid filter-wrapper method; Hybrid filters; Information gain; Optimizers; Text classification; Wrapper methods; Feature extraction","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (203/PKOMP/67711796)","This research paper introduces a newly proposed method to solve the text feature selection problem in text classification, which combines a filter approach based on the statistical IG measure, a wrapper approach using GWO algorithm, and NB classifier. This method is called a hybrid filter-wrapper approach. The top-N ranked features from all features search space selected by the IG filter pass as an input to the wrapper approach. This filtering process is carried out to remove useless features and reduce the search space in the wrapper approach by instructing GWO to explore and generate a new subset of prominent features from high-relevance features rather than all features. The proposed method achieved better performance than the most famous algorithms in the literature conducted on nine different benchmark text collections regarding F-measure, Recall, and Precision measures. The results demonstrate the utility of a hybrid feature selection method as a promising approach for solving feature selection problems in text classification. However, the proposed method verifies only on NB classifier. Other classification approaches are yet to be confirmed, such as Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Furthermore, GWO also has room for improvement, both in terms of obtaining a better classification performance or reducing the number of features, such as using a different fitness function or by hybridizing with an existing local search algorithm. Hence, further research will be carried out in future work.

A large number of approaches have been proposed to accomplish this task. These approaches identify a huge amount of potential aspects from customer reviews. But not all the extracted aspects are interesting and include terms which are not related to the product and these irrelevant terms affect the performance of the aspect extraction approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we are proposing a two-level aspect pruning approach to eliminate irrelevant aspects. The proposed approach performs the task of aspect pruning in two steps: (a) by calculating the frequency of each word and selecting the most frequent aspects; and (b) by calculating the semantic similarity of non-frequent words and eliminate aspects which are not semantically related to the product. Our experimental evaluation has shown a significant improvement of the proposed approach over the compared approaches. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Aspect pruning; Aspect-based sentiment analysis; Explicit aspects; Opinion mining","Data mining; Extraction; Semantics; Aspect pruning; Customer review; Experimental evaluation; Explicit aspects; Opinion mining; Semantic similarity; Sentiment analysis; Natural language processing systems","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Toqir A.

The Dynamic Service Placement and Replication (DSPR) framework is designed to manage services on distributed environment by repetitively searching for the best combination of distributed machines from a resource pool until the best working group is attained to satisfy the requirements of the service. In this research, a fuzzy logic based resource evaluation technique is proposed for the DSPR framework. The proposed technique is then compared with existing resource evaluation methods such as rule-based, utility-based and constraint-based. Besides that, the ability of DSPR to increase service availability in the event of multiple continuous failures is measured. The performance difference between using DSPR and conventional system with failover capability in the event of disaster was carried out. These experiments justify the suitability of using the proposed resource evaluation techniques compare to the existing work. © 2011 IEEE.","dynamic service placement and replication; fuzzy logic; resource evaluation; service availability","Constraint-based; Conventional systems; Core components; Distributed environments; Dynamic services; Failover; Resource evaluation; Resource selection; Rule based; Service availability; Working groups; Fuzzy logic","","","","","","","Armbrust M., Fox A., Griffith R., Joseph A.D., Katz R., Konwinski A., Lee G., Patterson D., Rabkin A., Stoica I., Zaharia M., A view of cloud computing, Commun.

E-book modeling includes the personalization structure with 3D modeling using Java 3D API. This model consists of four main components such as structural, processing, layout and stimulus functions. Structural component presents for utilizing XEBPER, an acronym for eXtensible E-Book Personalization structure. Processing is implementing with Java 3D system. Layout component enhances rendering methods by including virtual reality techniques using 2D/3D modeling techniques. Stimulus function component causes perfect connection between features and events. It establishes the capabilities for describing virtual reality about an e-book phenomenon, animating an e-book in real environment.

However, this paper strives to identify the implicit aspects based on hierarchical algorithm incorporated with common-sense knowledge by means of dimensionality reduction. © 2018 IEEE.","analogy-based; aspect aggregation; HDP; implicit aspect extraction; online reviews; topic modeling","Data mining; Dimensionality reduction; Sentiment analysis; analogy-based; Automatic systems; Commonsense knowledge; Hierarchical algorithm; Online reviews; Opinion targets; Research topics; Topic Modeling; Image processing","","","","","","","Liu B., Many Facets of Sentiment Analysis, pp. 11-39, (2017); Medelyan O., Milne D., Legg C., Witten I.H., Mining meaning from Wikipedia, Int.

These decisions are important in order to keep the software application relevant to the user's needs. However, the expert maintenance knowledge inherent in a software expert needs to be documented and updated all the time to be used in case the software expert is absence and also as future reference. The uniqueness of this study relies on the ability of a knowledge engineering method to capture the software maintenance knowledge of a software application that is inherent in the software expert's mind. This is crucial especially to support software maintenance decision making in the analysis phase of software maintenance.

In this paper, we discuss a novel knowledge acquisition and representation strategy using healthcare scenarios. This strategy is complemented with an ontology- or thesaurus-based input standardization mechanism to limit the diverse nature of the healthcare experts’ input. We also present in detail an algorithm for healthcare knowledge crystallization that, in addition to simulating the process of annealing, employs the notion of nucleation and growth on healthcare knowledge. The crystallized knowledge potentially undergoes a repair process that employs analogical reasoning to identify less useful knowledge and transform them, with the aid of more established knowledge, into useful ones. We conclude by asserting that the strategies presented do provide an all-rounded approach in our efforts to bring quality healthcare knowledge and services to the masses. © 2001, Sage Publications.

This is the most important task of aspect-based sentiment analysis as without the aspects, there is no much use of extracted opinions. Recent approaches have shown the significance of dependency-based rules for the given task. These rules are heavily dependent on the dependency parser and generated with the help of grammatical rules. In this article, we are proposing to learn from user’s behaviour to identify the relation among aspects and opinions. The use of sequential patterns has been proposed for the extraction of aspects. The key purpose of this research is to study the impact of sequential pattern mining in the phase of aspect extraction. Our experimental results show that the approach proposed in our work produced better results as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. © The Author(s) 2018.","aspect extraction; Aspect-based sentiment analysis;

This is due to the large number of unique words (or high dimensionality). Choosing semantic features instead could significantly reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. This article describes the use of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for question classification based on semantic features to improve both the training and testing speeds compared to the benchmark Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Improvements have also been made to the head word extraction and word sense disambiguation processes. These have resulted in a higher accuracy (an increase of 0.2%) for the classification of coarse classes compared to the benchmark. For the fine classes, however, there is a 1.0% decrease in accuracy but is compensated by a significant increase in speed (92.1% on average). © 2013 Published by ITB Journal Publisher.","Extreme learning machine; Head word feature; Question classification; Semantic features; Statistical question classification","","","","","","","","Riloff E., Mann G., Phillips W., Reverse-Engineering Question/Answer Collections from Ordinary Text, Advances In Open Domain Question Answering, pp. 505-531, (2006); Huang Z., Thint M., Qin Z., Question Classification Using Head Words and Their Hypernyms, Proceedings of the Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing, pp. 927-936, (2008); Cortes C., Vapnik V., Support Vector Network, Machine Learning, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (1995); Huang G.-B., Zhu Q.-Y., Siew C.-K., Extreme Learning Machine: Theory and Applications, Neurocomputing, 70, 1-3, pp. 489-501, (2006); Rumelhart D.E., Hinton G.E., Williams R.J., Learning Representations by Back-Propagating Errors, Neurocomputing: Foundations of Research, pp. 696-699, (1988); Collins M., Head-Driven Statistical Models For Natural Language Parsing, (1999); Pasca M.A., Harabagiu S.M., High Performance Question Answering, Proceedings of the 24th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference On Research and Development In Information Retrieval, pp. 366-374, (2001); Silva J.A., Coheur L., Mendes A., Wichert A., From Symbolic to Sub-Symbolic Information in Question Classification, Artificial Intelligence Review, 35, pp. 137-154, (2011); Fellbaum C., WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database, (1998); Li X., Roth D., Learning Question Classifiers, Proceedings of the 19th International Conference On Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 1-7, (2002); Even-Zohar Y., Roth D., A Sequential Model for Multi Class Classification, Proceedings of the 2001 Conference On Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing, pp. 10-19, (2001); Carlson A.J., Cumby C.M., Rosen J.L., Roth D., Snow User Guide, (1999); Cumby C., Roth D., Relational Representations That Facilitate Learning, Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference On the Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Breckenridge, pp. 425-434, (2000); Hacioglu K., Ward W., Question Classification with Support Vector Machines and Error Correcting Codes, Human Language Technologies 2003: The Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association For Computational Linguistics, pp. 28-30, (2003); Dietterich T.G., Bakiri G., Error-Correcting Output Codes: A General Method for Improving Multiclass Inductive Learning Programs, Ninth National Conference On Artificial Intelligence, Anaheim, pp. 527-577, (2002); Bikel D.M., Miller S., Schwartz R., Weischedel R., Nymble: A High-Performance Learning Name-Finder, Proceedings of the Fifth Conference On Applied Natural Language Processing, Washington, DC, Association For Computational Linguistics, pp. 194-201, (1997); Zhang D., Lee W.S., Question Classification Using Support Vector Machines, Proceedings of the 26th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference On Research and Development In Information Retrieval, pp. 26-32, (2003); Krishnan V., Das S., Chakrabarti S., Enhanced Answer Type Inference from Questions Using Sequential Models, Proceedings of the Conference On Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods In Natural Language Processing, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Association For Computational Linguistics, pp. 315-322, (2005); Nguyen M.L., Nguyen T.T., Shimazu A., Subtree Mining for Question Classification Problem, Twentieth Joint International Conference On Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1695-1700, (2007); Berger A.L., Pietra V.J.D., Pietra S.A.D., A Maximum Entropy Approach to Natural Language Processing, Comput.

This can be addressed by ontology mapping. Issues related to ontology mapping include the lack of efforts to hybridize the various ontology mapping algorithms that are available. Another problem concerns the mapping approaches themselves, i.e. these are either concept-based or instance-based (and not a combination of these). In this paper, we present an approach for ontology mapping. Our approach employs a library of ontology mapping algorithms. A number of these algorithms are selected and linked or hybrided to produce a composite algorithm. Furthermore, we also present a result aggregation engine which can either present results of the individual algorithms separately or fuse the results of the composite algorithm. © 2010 IEEE.","Genetic algorithm; Mapping; Ontology","Conformal mapping; Genetic algorithms; Information technology; Composite algorithm; Concept-based; Hybrid approach; Ontology mapping; Ontology","","","","","","","Jingshan H., Jiangbo D., Jose M.V., Michael N.H., Ontology matching using an artificial neural network to learn weights, Proceedings IJCAI Workshop on Semantic Web for Collaborative Knowledge Acquisition (SWeCKa-07), (2007); Feiyu L., State of the Art: Automatic Ontology Matching, (2007); Davis M., A Survey of Recent Research in Ontology Mapping, (2009); Curino C.A., Orsi G., Tanca L., X-SOM: Ontology mapping and inconsistency resolution, 4th European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC '07), (2007); Ming M., Yefei P., Michael S., A harmony based adaptive ontology mapping approach, The 2008 International Conference on Semantic Web and Web Services (SWWS'08), (2008); Kiu C.C., Lee C.S., Ontology Mapping and Merging through OntoDNA for Learning Object Reusability, (2006); Ehrig M., Sure Y., Ontology mapping - An integrated approach, 1st European Semantic Web Symposium, (2004); Jinguang G., Gu Z.Y., Ontology fusion with complex mapping patterns, Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems, 10th International Conference, (2006); Boury-Brisset A.-C., Ontology-based approach for information fusion, Proceedings of the ISIF Conference, (2003); Nikolov A., Uren V., Motta E., Roeck A.D., Handling instance coreferencing in the KnoFuss architecture, Workshop Identity and Reference on the Semantic Web, (2008)","S.

At a more fine-grained level, aspect-based sentiment analysis focuses on the targets of users’ opinions and determining sentiment orientation of these opinions. Among different tasks of aspect-based sentiment analysis, aspect extraction is the key task which includes extraction of both explicit and implicit aspects. Due to the complexity of implicit aspects, not much effort has been put forward to solve the problem while explicit aspects have been studied extensively in the recent past. Existing approaches for implicit aspect extraction have focused on specific type of aspects and have neglected the actual problem. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed a multi-level approach which identifies implicit aspects using co-occurrence and similarity-based techniques. This research focuses on the extraction of clues for implicit targets of users’ opinions and identification of true targets of users’ opinions with the help of implicit aspect clues. The proposed approach is divided into two phases: first, several rules are crafted to identify clues for implicit aspects in a review sentence. Secondly, aspects are assigned on the basis of extracted clues using proposed multi-level approach. The proposed model can extract not only implicit aspect clues associated with opinion words but also allocate clues to opinion words where no association is identified. This helps to identify implicit aspects with or without co-occurrences of opinion words with explicit aspects. Experimental evaluation elaborates the importance of implicit aspect clues in the identification of targets of users’ opinions. The proposed approach shows better results as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for the identification of implicit targets of users’ opinions on a dataset of different product reviews. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Co-occurrences; IAC; Implicit aspect extraction; Multi-level knowledge-based approach; NGD","Knowledge based systems; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; Aspect identifications; Experimental evaluation; Knowledge-based approach; NAtural language processing; Product reviews; State-of-the-art approach; Subjective information; Systematic identification; Extraction","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8014002)","The authors wish to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for funding this research through the Research University Grant (1001/PKOMP/8014002).

Here, we present a Tacit Knowledge Acquisition Info-structure (TKAI) that allows remote domain experts to record their tacit knowledge via a novel tacit knowledge acquisition construct called Scenarios. In this info-structure, an ontology is employed to enforce standardization in view that tacit knowledge is deemed to be hierarchical in structure and personal in nature. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is also featured to encode the acquired scenario instances and to facilitate their transfer over the Internet for the global sharing of the acquired tacit knowledge. XML also allows the translation of scenario instances into other representational languages that are deemed more appropriate for specific tasks.","","Decision theory; Internet; Intelligent systems; Knowledge management; Ontologies; Tacit knowledge acquisition; XML; Knowledge acquisition","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","2000 TENCON Proceedings","24 September 2000 through 27 September 2000","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","57941","","","85QXA","","English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034428905"

This task focuses on the identification of the targets of user's opinions or sentiments from online reviews. In the recent years, syntactic patterns-based approaches have performed quite well and produced significant improvement in the aspect extraction task. However, these approaches are heavily dependent on the dependency parsers which produced syntactic relations following the grammatical rules and language constraints. In contemporary, users do not give much importance to these rules and constraints while expressing their opinions about particular product and neither reviewer websites restrict users to do so. This makes syntactic patterns-based approaches vulnerable. Therefore, in this paper, we are proposing a two-fold rules-based model (TF-RBM) which uses rules defined on the basis of sequential patterns mined from customer reviews. The first fold extracts aspects associated with domain independent opinions and the second fold extracts aspects associated with domain dependent opinions. We have also applied frequency- and similarity-based approaches to improve the aspect extraction accuracy of the proposed model. Our experimental evaluation has shown better results as compared with the state-of-the-art and most recent approaches. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aspect extraction; Aspect pruning; Aspect-based sentiment analysis;

The proposed measures adopt the shortest path between synsets in WordNet as the core to measure the relatedness between two sentences. The interlinked synsets in WordNet are based on the conceptual-semantic relation between two synsets. Thus the distance between two synsets in WordNet can be used to measure the semantic relatedness between two synsets. This study derived a sentence-level semantic relatedness using this feature to detect paraphrasing among sentences. The performance of the proposed semantic relatedness in paraphrasing is evaluated based on the accuracy and F-measures of the proposed measures in identifying paraphrase in Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus. The proposed method achieved 71.1% in accuracy and 81.8% in F-measures. The performance of the proposed method is compared with 6 paraphrase detection methods which include Salient Semantic Analysis and Second-order Co-occurrence Pointwise Mutual Information. In the comparison, the proposed method achieved the fourth highest accuracy and the second highest F-measure compare to other methods.

People use text features to add or emphasise feelings and emotions in their text. The text emphasis can come in as capital letters, letter repetition, exclamation marks and emoticons. The existing literature has not paid sufficient attention to the effects of such textual variations on human text interpretation. This paper presents an analysis of text variations that can affect the interpretation of a text. A total of 1,041 online comments were collected, in which seven types of the most used textual variations were identified and simulated for hypothesis testing. Sentiment scores from 500 participants were collected to rate the value expressed for each of the textual variations. Statistical analysis showed that collected ratings are significant for the accurate calculation of sentiment values for short comments. Furthermore, the performance of ten existing sentiment tools was analysed based on seven textual variations. Results indicate that those tools should consider these textual variations to fully reflect a human interpretation on the text variations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Classification algorithms; computer mediated cues (CMC); NLP tools; Punctuation; Sentiment analysis; Text analysis; Text mining","Classification algorithm; Computer mediated cue; Human judgments; NLP tools; Online reviews; Product choice; Punctuation; Sentiment analysis; Service choice; Word-of-mouth communication; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Alharbi A.S.M., de Doncker E., Twitter sentiment analysis with a deep neural network: An enhanced approach using user behavioral information, Cogn.

Text mining is an interdisciplinary field which depends on information retrieval, data mining, machine learning, parameter statistics and computational linguistics. Standard text mining and retrieval information techniques of text document usually rely on similar categories. An alternative method of retrieving information is clustering documents to preprocess text. The preprocessing steps have a huge effect on the success to extract knowledge. This study implements TF-IDF and singular value decomposition (SVD) dimensionality reduction techniques. The proposed system presents an effective preprocessing and dimensionality reduction techniques which help the document clustering by using k-means algorithm. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method enhances the performance of English text document clustering. Simulation results on BBC news and BBC sport datasets show the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.","clustering; clustering; dimension reduction; k-means; retrieval information; singular value decomposition; Text mining","Data mining; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Reduction; Singular value decomposition; Text processing; Clusterings; Dimension reduction; Dimension reduction techniques; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Document pre-processing; K-means; Text document; Text Document Clustering; Text-mining; Cluster analysis","","","","","","","Wong M.K., Abidi S.S.R., Jonsen D., A multi-phase correlation search framework for mining non-taxonomic relations from unstructured text, Knowledge and Information Systems, 38, 3, pp. 641-667, (2014); Han J., Kamber M., Data Mining, Southeast Asia Edition: Concepts and Techniques, (2006); Larose D.T., Discovering Knowledge in Data: An Introduction to Data Mining, (2014); Ahmad R., Khanum A., Document topic generation in text mining by using cluster analysis with EROCK, International Journal of Computer Science & Security (IJCSS), 4, 2, (2008); Karypis G., Han E.H., Kumar V., Chameleon: Hierarchical clustering using dynamic modeling, Computer, 32, 8, pp. 68-75, (1999); Zhang T., Ramakrishnan R., Livny M., BIRCH: An efficient data clustering method for very large databases, ACM SIGMOD Record, 25, 2, (1996); Ramasundaram S., Victor S.P., Text categorization by backpropagation network, International Journal of Computer Applications, 8, pp. 1-5, (2010); Banchs R.E., Text Mining with MATLAB, (2012)","","Al-Dabass D.; Saad I.; Mohamad K.A.; Hijazi M.H.A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence with Applications in Engineering and Technology, ICAIET 2014","2 December 2014 through 5 December 2014","Kota Kinabalu, Sabah","118813","","978-147997910-3","","","English","Proc. - Int.

However, most of these algorithms aim to improve service performance or to reduce operation cost and do not consider the reliability and availability of their resources. Most of them do not consider events when machines in their resource pool malfunction. These malfunctioned machines could cause services to halt or, worse, to produce transient and intermittent errors. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic service placement and redundancy (DSPR) concept to manage service placement and replicas to achieve high availability and that is capable of detecting and recovering from arbitrary faults.

It is a crucial task that aids machine learning classifiers in reducing error rates, computation time, overfitting, and improving classification accuracy. It has demonstrated its efficacy in myriads of domains, ranging from its use for text classification (TC), text mining, and image recognition. While there are many traditional FS methods, recent research efforts have been devoted to applying metaheuristic algorithms as FS techniques for the TC task. However, there are few literature reviews concerning TC. Therefore, a comprehensive overview was systematically studied by exploring available studies of different metaheuristic algorithms used for FS to improve TC. This paper will contribute to the body of existing knowledge by answering four research questions (RQs): 1) What are the different approaches of FS that apply metaheuristic algorithms to improve TC? 2) Does applying metaheuristic algorithms for TC lead to better accuracy than the typical FS methods? 3) How effective are the modified, hybridized metaheuristic algorithms for text FS problems?, and 4) What are the gaps in the current studies and their future directions? These RQs led to a study of recent works on metaheuristic-based FS methods, their contributions, and limitations. Hence, a final list of thirty-seven (37) related articles was extracted and investigated to align with our RQs to generate new knowledge in the domain of study. Most of the conducted papers focused on addressing the TC in tandem with metaheuristic algorithms based on the wrapper and hybrid FS approaches. Future research should focus on using a hybrid-based FS approach as it intuitively handles complex optimization problems and potentiality provide new research opportunities in this rapidly developing field.  © 2013 IEEE.","Feature selection; hybrid-based approach; metaheuristic optimization algorithms; text classification; wrapper-based approach","Character recognition; Classification (of information); Data mining; Feature extraction; Image recognition; Learning systems; Optimization; Classification algorithm; Features extraction; Features selection; Hybrid-based approach; Metaheuristic; Metaheuristic optimization; Metaheuristic optimization algorithm; Optimization algorithms; Search problem; Systematic; Text categorization; Wrapper-based approach; Text processing","","","","","","","Majidpour H., Gharehchopogh F.S., An improved flower pollination algorithm with AdaBoost algorithm for feature selection in text documents classification, J.

An NSGA-II inspired elitism strategy and a population initialization strategy are embedded into the traditional micro Genetic Algorithm (mGA) to form the proposed MmGA. The main aim of the MmGA is to improve its convergence rate towards the pareto optimal solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the MmGA, two experiments using the Kursawe test function in MOPs are conducted, and the results are compared with those from other approaches using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm indicator, i.e. the Generational Distance (GD). The outcomes positively demonstrate that the MmGA is able to provide useful solutions with improved GD measures for tackling MOPs. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

However, most of these algorithms aim to improve service performance or to reduce operation cost and do not consider the reliability and availability of their resources. Most of them do not consider events when machines in their resource pool malfunction. These malfunctioned machines could cause services to halt or, worse, to produce transient and intermittent errors. Presently, most of the solutions proposed to improve service availability are based on having redundancy units that do not consider the amount of work and resources needed to create replicas, which greatly increases the complexity of the management of a distributed system. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art techniques that could improve service availability in distributed environments and propose an autonomic algorithm based on team building concept that dynamically performs service placement to improve service availability even in the event of resource failures. © 2010 IEEE.","Autonomic computing; Resource availability; Resource management; Service placement","Information technology; Lakes; Natural resources management; Quality assurance; Redundancy; Resource allocation; Autonomic Computing; Distributed environments; Distributed systems; Dynamic services; Operation cost; Placement algorithm; Reliability and availability; Resource availability; Resource management; Service availability; Service performance; Service placement; Team building; Algorithms","","","","","","","Kephart J.O., Research challenges of autonomic computing, Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Software Engineering, (2005); Sterritt R., Autonomic computing, Innovations Systems Software Engineering, 1, 1, pp. 79-88, (2005); Samuel K., Ramon N., Jordi T., Autonomic QoS-Aware resource management in grid computing using online performance models, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Performance Evaluation Methodologies and Tools, (2007); Folino G., Spezzano G., An autonomic tool for building self-organizing Grid-enabled applications, Future Gener.

Having different ontologies to support different semantic web documents leads to the problem of ontology integration in a broader sense. This brings about the need for ontology mapping. The problem with current ontology mapping approaches is that they are only able to solve specific areas of ontology mapping. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach based on genetic algorithm that determines the best combination of algorithms to map the ontologies. A hybrid approach looks into different aspect of the ontology, resulting in an overall optimized ontology mapping result. © 2011 IEEE.","ontology mapping; semantic web","Artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithms; Mapping; Semantic Web; World Wide Web; Fundamental building blocks; Hybrid approach; Ontology integration; Ontology mapping; Semantic web documents; Specific areas; Ontology","","","","","","","Huang J., Dang J., Vidal J.M., Huhns M.N., Ontology Matching Using an Artificial Neural Network to Learn Weights, Proc.

However, their effectiveness is limited in view that it is difficult to develop a knowledge discovery pipeline that is suited for all types of datasets. Moreover, it is difficult to select the best possible algorithm for each stage of the pipeline. In this paper, we define (a) a novel clustering ensemble algorithm based on self-organizing maps to automate the annotation of un-annotated medical datasets; (b) a data discretization algorithm based on Boolean Reasoning to discretize continuous data values; (c) a rule filtering mechanism; and (d) to extend the regular knowledge discovery process by including a learning mechanism based on neural network ensembles to produce a neural knowledge base for decision support. We believe that this would result in a decision support system that is tolerant towards ambiguous queries, e.g. with incomplete inputs. We also believe that the boosting and aggregating features of ensemble techniques would help to compensate for any shortcomings in some stages of the pipeline. Ultimately, we combine these efforts to produce an extended knowledge discovery pipeline.","Clustering ensemble; Discretization; Knowledge discovery; Neural network ensemble; Rough set analysis","Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Conformal mapping; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Industry; Knowledge based systems; Learning algorithms; Metadata; Pipelines; Rough set theory; Self organizing maps; Clustering Ensemble; Discretization; Knowledge Discovery; Neural network ensemble; Rough set analysis; Medical education","","","","","","","Abidi S.S.R., Hoe K.M., Symbolic exposition of medical data-sets: A data mining workbench to inductively derive data-defining symbolic rules, Proceedings of the 15th IEEE Symposium on Computer Based Medical Systems (CBMS 2002), (2002); Breiman L., Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, pp. 123-140, (1996); Dimitriadou E., Weingessel A., Hornik K., A cluster ensembles framework, Design and Application of Hybrid Intelligent Systems.

SA deals with the computational treatment or the classification of user’s sentiments, opinions and emotions hidden within the text. Aspect extraction is the most vital and extensively explored phase of SA to carry out the classification of sentiments in precise manners. During the last decade, enormous number of research has focused on identifying and extracting aspects. Therefore, in this survey, a comprehensive overview has been attempted for different aspect extraction techniques and approaches. These techniques have been categorized in accordance with the adopted approach. Despite being a traditional survey, a comprehensive comparative analysis is conducted among different approaches of aspect extraction, which not only elaborates the performance of any technique but also guides the reader to compare the accuracy with other state-of-the-art and most recent approaches. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Aspect extraction; Aspect-level sentiment analysis; Explicit aspect; Implicit aspect","Extraction; Natural language processing systems; Sentiment analysis; Surveys; Text processing; Comparative analysis; Explicit aspect; Extraction techniques; Implicit aspect; State of the art; Text mining; World wide webs (WWW); Data mining","","","","","","","Agraval R., Srikant R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules in large data bases.
