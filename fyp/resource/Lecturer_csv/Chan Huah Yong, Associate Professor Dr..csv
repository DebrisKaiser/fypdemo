Manually achieving a useful timetable requires many days of effort, and the results are still unsatisfactory. unsatisfactory. Various states of art methods (heuristic, meta-heuristic) are used to satisfactorily solve UCTP. However, these approaches typically represent the instance-specific solutions. The hyper-heuristic framework adequately addresses this complex problem. This research proposed Particle Swarm Optimizer-based Hyper Heuristic (HH PSO) to solve UCTP efficiently. PSO is used as a higher-level method that selects low-level heuristics (LLH) sequence which further generates an optimal solution. The proposed approach generates solutions into two phases (initial and improvement). A new LLH named “least possible rooms left” has been developed and proposed to schedule events. Both datasets of international timetabling competition (ITC) i.e., ITC 2002 and ITC 2007 are used to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed low-level heuristic helps to schedule events at the initial stage. When compared with other LLH’s, the proposed LLH schedule more events for 14 and 15 data instances out of 24 and 20 data instances of ITC 2002 and ITC 2007, respectively. The experimental study shows that HH PSO gets a lower soft constraint violation rate on seven and six data instances of ITC 2007 and ITC 2002, respectively. This research has concluded the proposed LLH can get a feasible solution if prioritized. © 2021 University of Baghdad.

They have gained their importance due to the thriving development of the Internet in this century coupled with the explosive growth of data, which leads to increased demand for ontologies or KG to promote the Semantic Web and AI applications. Many researchers conflate ontology with KG, especially when even Wikipedia refers to both terms as synonymous; however, the difference is obvious. In this paper, we will highlight the differences between ontology and KG.

In practice, industries produce holes on composite panels by drilling. However, this process is time consuming, which lowers productivity. The process may improve by implementing punching instead. In this study, few die sets with different die clearances are fabricated, and an experiment is performed using a Universal Testing Machine (UTM). The images of the punched holes are scanned using a high-resolution machine vision camera, and then the holes are analyzed using the KLONK image measurement software. Results show that a smaller die clearance increases the accuracy of the punched hole size, and the effect of two-step punching on the quality of the punched hole sizes are also depicted. © 2015, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

Packet World Problem is MAS application used in this research to study the cooperation interaction between agents. This research aims to prove that using cooperative MAS algorithm will solve packet world problem in minimum number of steps, less time, and decrease network consumption. This will minimize processor and memory utilization. Packet World Problem is a case study used in literature to study MAS interactions and characteristics. It is an environment consists of multiple agents and packets, whereas they were distributed on different Grid machines. The main goal of this problem is cleaning the environment from packets. The proposed work includes Cooperative MAS model which consists of two levels, where each level has a specific sub-goal to achieve. Agents at both levels cooperate to achieve the global goal. In the same time the proposed work includes Cooperative MAS algorithm which solve Packet World Problem efficiently. Different scenarios were tested and the proposed algorithm gave results as enhancement of 84% less in number of steps, 40% less in consumed time and 72% less in network consumption. ©2009 IEEE.","Cooperation; Distributed systems; Grid; Multi-Agent System (MAS); Packet world problem","Air traffic control; Algorithms; Digital television; Research; Distributed systems; E-Commerce; In-network; MAS applications; Memory utilization; Multiple agents; Subgoals; Transportation system; WEB application; Multi agent systems","","","","","","","Vlassis N., A Concise Introduction to Multiagent Systems and Distributed Artificial Intelligence, (2007); Timm I., Pawlaszczyk D., Large Scale Multiagent Simulation on the Grid, Proceedings of the Workshop on Agent-based Grid Economics (AGE 2005) at the IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid (CCGRID).

It provides distributed applications to synchronize the access to the shared resources. In this paper, we proposed a Hybrid algorithm combined from Ring and Multicast algorithms which will decrease the bandwidth consumption and response time from request to grant. In the Hybrid algorithm, the number of messages needed for request and release operations which refer to the response time will be decreased, and the bandwidth consumption for these operations in the network will be decreased as well, by eliminating the useless consumption in the Ring algorithm and decreasing it in Multicast algorithm. Good results had been achieved for the proposed algorithm comparing to the original ones. © 2012 IEEE.","Critical Section; Distributed Lock Manager; Multicast Algorithm; Ring Algorithm","Bandwidth; Communication; Information technology; Managers; Multicasting; Bandwidth consumption; Critical sections; Distributed applications; Distributed environments; Distributed lock manager; Hybrid algorithms; Multicast algorithms; Multicasts; Performance enhancements; Shared resources; Algorithms","","","","","","","Shirali M., Haghighattoroghi A., Vojdani M., Leader election algorithms: History and Novel Schemes,  International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology IEEE 2008; Stonebraker M., Aoki P.M., Litwin W., Pfeffer A., Sah A., Sidell J., Staelin C., Mariposa A.Yu., A Wide-area Distributed Database System, The VLDB Journal, (1996); Tanenbaum A.S., Van Steen M., Distributed Systems Principles and Paradigms, (2004); Connolly T.M., Begg C.E., Database System A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation, and Management, (1998); Elmasri R., Navathe S.B., Fundamentals of Database Systems, (2004); Devulapalli A., Wyckoff P., Distributed Queue-based Locking using Advanced Network Features, Proceedings of the International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)IEE 2005; Knottenbelt W.J., Zertal S., Harrison P.G., Performance Analysis of Three Implementation Strategies for Distributed Lock Management, IEE Proc.-Comput.

In large-scale Grid, data replication provides a suitable solution for managing data files where data reliability and data availability are enhanced. Replica selection is one of the major functions of data replication that decides which replica location is the best for Grid users. In this paper, we address the replica selection problem in a Grid environment where the users are competing for the limited data resource. Thus, our aim is to establish fairness among the users in the selection decisions. Since the criteria that play a role in the selection process conflict with each other and produce heterogeneous values, the Analytical Hierarchy Process is used to solve this optimization problem. The proposed system validity and performance are evaluated by using a simulation. The simulation results were produced and discussed in this paper. © 2009 IEEE.","Analytical hierarchy process; Data grid; Fairness; Replica optimization service","Large scale systems; Analytical hierarchy process; Data availability; Data files; Data grid; Data reliability; Data replication; Fairness; Grid environments; Grid users; Limited data; Optimization problems; Replica location; Replica optimization service; Scientific applications; Selection decisions; Selection problems; Selection process; Simulation result; Suitable solutions; Wide area; Optimization","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Croatia","Chan Huah Yong is a senior lecturer in the School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).

For this reason, resource selection has been a challenging task especially in meeting user's demand for a quality of service (QoS). A quality of service is the ability to serve a job by providing quality and reliable resource in fulfilling the user's need. Quality and reliable resource selections naturally yield excellent and quality results. The background of the users and where the resource belongs to are important in determining the quality of a resource. This paper concerns with efficient and quality-based resource discovery using Condor ClassAd and PageRank technique in order to achieve a quality resource matching. The paper discusses how quality of users and resources are determined and considered in the discovery process prior to allocating jobs to resources. © 2006 IEEE.","","Customer satisfaction; Distributed computer systems; Quality control; Quality of service; Grid environment; Quality resource matching; Resource discovery; Resource allocation","","","","","","","Foster I., Kesselman C.G., The Grid: Blueprint for a Future Computing Infrastructure, (1999); Ridings C., Shishigin M., PageRank Uncovered, (2002); Brin S., Page L., The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine, Proceedings of the 7th World Wide Web Conference, (1998); Page L., Brin S., Motwani R., Winograd T., The pagerank citation algorithm: Bringing order to the web, Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on World Wide Web, (1998); Thain D., Tannenbaum T., Livny M., Condor and the Grid, (2003); Tannenbaum T., Wright D., Miller K., Livny M., Condor - A Distributed Job Scheduler, (2002); Coleman N., Raman R., Livny M., Solomon M., Distributed Policy Management and Comprehension with Classified Advertisements, (2003); Raman R., Livny M., Solomon M., Matchmaking: Distributed resource management for high throughput computing, Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing, (1998); Roy A., Livny M., Condor and preemptive resume scheduling, Published in Grid Resource Management: State of the Art and Future Trends, pp. 135-144, (2003); Raman R., Matchmaking Frameworks for Distributed Resource Management, (2000); Hoong D.C., Buyya R., Guided Google: A Meta Search Engine and Its Implementation Using the Google Distributed Web Services, (2003); Buyya R., Abramson D., Giddy J., Nimrod/G: An architecture for a resource management and scheduling system in a global computational grid, 4th Intl.

Uncontrolled burr not only affects the geometrical precision of the blanked parts, it also ruins their assembly. In this study, a comprehensive review on burr formation and the parameters that become the source of its occurrence are discussed. The analysis was made on the most relevant literatures and categorized based on key words and the methodology used. Based on the analysis, it is found that die clearance is the most relevant parameters, which carried out experimentally. The paper also presented the current challenges facing by the manufacturer as well as researcher on burr problem and outlined some of the solutions suggested to overcome this problem. In addition, the authors raised the problem on measurement of the burr as the size of the component become smaller and level of precision is higher. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2014.","Burr; Die clearance; Precision blanking; Punching","","","","","","","","Al-Momania E., Rawabdeh I., An application of finite element method and design of experiments in the optimization of sheet metal blanking process, Jordan J.

Currently, many efficient algorithms are available to sufficiently detect plagiarism in a document. Pre-processing of a document typically remains a master key to achieving the maximum stable goal. Although all algorithms, before checking plagiarism, initially perform some sort of pre-processing on documents and convert the document into a particular format like by removing whitespaces and all special characters, etc. In this paper, we focus on two possible techniques, which can be used for plagiarism, which existing plagiarism detection algorithms are omitting. First is replacing the white spaces with a hidden character with white color (background color) between consecutive words so apparently, they seem to be distinct words, but the algorithm/computer will incorrectly consider them as a single word. So even a 100% copied statement would not be identified as plagiarized content. The second is hiding spam text behind images to falsely report the maximum number of words count in a document but as they are hidden so human eye can’t discover them and the algorithm will consider them as some words resulting in less percentile score of the plagiarized document. Our proposed (pre-processing) technique can efficiently handle these two critical problems which result in improved accuracy and authenticity of plagiarism checking algorithms. We have compared the performance of our algorithm considering these critical issues with other state-of-art algorithms (particularly with Turnitin) and our algorithm handles these issues efficiently. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Invisible text; Plagiarism detection algorithm; Text behind images","Image enhancement; Signal detection; Academic research; Detection algorithm; Invisible text; Master key; Plagiarism detection; Plagiarism detection algorithm; Pre-processing; Special characters; Text behind image; White space; Intellectual property","","","","","","","Ekbal A., Saha S., Choudhary G., Plagiarism detection in text using vectorspace model, 12Th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems, (2012); Malik S.R., Gulia M., Rabin-Karp algorithm with hashing a string matching tool, Int.

It provides an opportunity to harness a lot of idle peer-resources such as desktop computers across the Internet, for solving large-scale computing applications. Each peer is autonomous and it needs incentive for sustained contribution of its resources to P2P applications. In addition, a flexible and efficient job scheduling is needed to harvest the idle computing power as cheaply and economically as possible. This paper introduces an economic based job scheduler for mapping jobs to resources in P2P computing environment. The scheduler has been implemented with the Compute Power Market (CPM) system developed using Sun JXTA P2P technology. Our scheduler can be configured depending on users' quality of service requirements such as the deadline and budget constraints. Our scheduler follows a hierarchy scheme. The design allows multiple consumers and multiple providers to schedule and run jobs. To allow wider support for a wide variety of applications, the system is designed to allow easy 'plug in' of user applications. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.","","Budget control; Commerce; Distributed computer systems; Personal computers; Quality of service; Scheduling; Social networking (online); Budget constraint; Computing power; Large-scale computing; P2P applications; P2P technologies; Peer-to-peer computing; Peer-to-peer computing systems; Web based computing; Peer to peer networks","","","","","","","Shikey C., What is P2P⋯ And What Isn't, (2000); Subramani V., Kettimuthu Srividya R., Sadayappan S.P., Distributed Job Scheduling on Computational Grids using Multiple Simultaneous Requests, Proceedings of the 11th IEEE International Symposium on High Performance.

Closely related to the third dimension of depth, this operation can be accomplished using human vision, though considered challenging due to the various issues when using computer vision. The differences in the geometry, the texture of the scene, the occlusion scene boundaries and the inherent ambiguity exist because of the minimal information that could be gathered from a single image. This paper, therefore, proposes a novel depth estimation in the field of architecture, which includes the stages that can manage depth estimation from a single RGB image. An encoder-decoder architecture has been proposed, based on the improvement yielded from DenseNet that extracted the map of an image using skip connection technique. This paper also takes on the reverse Huber loss function that essentially suits our architecture hand driven by the value distributions that are commonly present in depth maps. Experimental results have indicated that the depth estimation architecture that employs the NYU Depth v2 dataset has a better performance than the other state-of-the-art methods that tend to have fewer parameters and require fewer training time. © 2020, Scientific Research Support Fund of Jordan.

Hence the idea of preventing crime from occurring is the best for public safety. This can only be achieved if the law enforcement agencies have a prior knowledge of where and when a crime will occur. A crime is an act that is criminal under the law. It is detrimental to society to comprehend crime in order to prevent criminal action. In order to prevent and solve crime, data-driven research is beneficial. Bandit crime has been on the rise in Nigeria, thereby causing public disorder. In this study, from the perspective of artificial intelligence, a novel hybrid deep learning model for crime prediction is proposed. Bandits crime datasets are obtained online through news archives which are less expensive. Spatial crime analysis was carried out on the novel bandit crime dataset obtained and prediction were made using the newly proposed DeCXGBoost model. A comparative analysis was performed with respect to precision, recall, f-measure, and accuracy with other crime predictions algorithms and the proposed model outperformed the other algorithms with accuracy of 99.9999%. © 2023 Instituto Politecnico Nacional.

The team formation algorithm is designed in a way that it would continuously search for resources with better performance and pool resources together to achieve better availability. The main intention of this work is not to replace the human administrators but to provide a better alternative in managing services in dynamic distributed environment. Instructions from the administrators are still required but at a different level. Administrators are freed from making low level decisions such as to decide the actual placement of the services and design the failover capabilities for each of the services. The evaluation results showed that the framework is capable of managing resources according to the requirements given by administrator, even during in the event of multiple consecutive resources failure. The proposed solution had the probability of 72.1% of its services that are still available after 83.3% of the available resources were shut down while conventional failover solution using three redundant units had only the probability of 40.8% of services that are still available. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

By analyzing and comparing eight known prediction models: Naive Bayes, Stacking, Random Forest, Lazy:IBK, Bagging, Support Vector Machine, Convolutional Neural Network, and Locally Weighted Learning - this study proposed an improved deep learning crime prediction model using convolutional neural networks and the xgboost algorithm to predict crime. The major goal of this research is to provide an improved crime prediction model based on previous criminal records. Using the Boston crime dataset, where our larceny crime dataset was extracted, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used to uncover patterns and explain trends in crimes. The performance of the proposed model on the basis of accuracy, recall, and f-measure was 100% outperforming the other models used in this study. The analysis of the proposed model and prediction can aid security services in making better use of their resources, anticipating crime at a certain time, and serving the society better. © 2023 Slovak Academy of Sciences.

Each of the VO classes has different goals that hope to be achieved by providing policies. The main question in this regard is that ""how such policies can help the entire VO participants achieve their goals"". Approach: As a first step to address this question, we developed and evaluated a policy management framework within a specialized context, namely Utility based Policy Management System (U-PMS). We proposed an approach for policy federation, in which a group of VO participants agreed to adopt common standards to provide a common infrastructure that unifies the way the policies were applied in VO. Results: The evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed approach was able to manage VO policies and achieve higher utility for VO participant through its management functions. It outperforms the related system by 9.99% for acceptance function and 5.77% for conflict resolution and 4.65% for policy merging. Conclusion: We observed that the utility of VO participants' can be improved through managing the applied polices in VO. © 2009 Science Publications.","Multi-attribute utility theory; Policy utility; Virtual organization management","","","","","","","","Foster I., Kesselman C., Tuecke S., The anatomy of the grid: Enabling scalable virtual organizations, Int.

It discusses the characteristics of classical authorization system and requirements of the authorization system in pervasive grid environment as well. Based on our analysis of current systems and taking into account the main requirements of such pervasive environment, we propose new authorization system architecture as an extension of the existing grid authorization mechanisms. This architecture not only supports user attributes but also context attributes which act as a key concept for context-awareness thought. The architecture allows authorization of users dynamically when there are changes in the pervasive grid environment. For this, we opt for hybrid authorization method that integrates push and pull mechanisms to combine the existing grid authorization attributes with dynamic context assertions. We will investigate the proposed architecture using a real testing environment that includes heterogeneous pervasive grid infrastructures mapped over multiple virtual organizations. Various scenarios are described in the last section of the article to strengthen the proposed mechanism with different facilities for the authorization procedure.","Authorization System; Contextawareness; Pervasive Grid; Ubiquity","Engineering; Technology; Authorization procedure; Authorization systems; Context attributes; Context-Aware; Context-awareness; Dynamic contexts; Pervasive environments; Pervasive grid computing; Pervasive grids; Proposed architectures; Testing environment; Ubiquity; Virtual organization; Grid computing","","","","","","","Foster I., Kesselman C., Tuecke S., The Anatomy of the Grid: Enabling Scalable Virtual Organizations, International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications, 15, 3, pp. 200-222, (2001); Chin J., Zhang N., Nenadic A., Bamasak O., A context-constrained authorisation (cocoa) framework for pervasive grid computing, Wireless Networks; Pervasive Grids: Challenges and Opportunities, Handbook of Research on Scalable Computing Technologies, (2009); Chakrabarti A., Grid Authorization System, Grid Computing Security, (2007); Carter R.G., Authentication vs. Authorization, Kerberos: What, Why, How?, (2010); Tanenbaum A.S., Steen M.V., Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms, (2002); Alfieri R., Cecchini R., Ciaschini V., dell' Agnello L., Frohner A., Et al., VOMS, an Authorization System for Virtual Organizations, Proceedings of the 1st European Across Grids Conference-Santiago de Compostela, Spain, (2003); Lorch M., Cowles B., Baker R., Gommans L., Madsen P., McNab A., Ramakrishnan L., Sankar K., Skow D., Thompson M.R., Conceptual Grid Authorization Framework and Classification, Authrization Frameworks and Mechanisms-WG, (2004); Pervasive Grids: Challenges and Opportunities, Handbook of Research on Scalable Computing Technologies, (2009); Sun H.-M., Wang K.-H., Kebbeh P.S., Distributed Authorization and Authentication Framework for a Grid Infrastructure, (2007); Liu S., A study on the Mechanisms of Policy-based Grid Authorization, 2009 International Conference on multimedia Information Networking and Security, (2009); Chadwick D.W., Otenko A., The PERMIS X.509 Role Based Privilege Management Infrastructure, In Proc.

However, extending the group work in this new environment remains an important challenge to provide humans with comfortable and adequate pervasive features. Consequently, a given solution would lead to a developed grid support for collaborative work and, thereafter, would conduce to successful supply of enough facilities to reach the real environment. Currently, available pervasive grid solutions do not provide plenty of support to such required environment due to sensing restrictions, classical grid limitations for enabling ubiquity devices as part of heterogeneous resources and diverse constraints on collaborative developments especially related to the scalability of groupware. The purpose of this work is to promote a platform tying together high performance of group-work environment, transparent grid infrastructure dedicated to ubiquitous computing and commodious brace of collaborative groupware and finally diverse frameworks of interactions: human-machine interactions, human-human mediated interactions and human-robot interactions. In this paper, we present eRoboRy platform, for: Collaborative Explorer Robots Platform for Remote Reality Discovery. It allows multiple robots, as intelligent devices, to operate collaboratively within a new structure of remote robot environment, which includes multiple operators as well. This research work undertakes to offer a new network of collaborative robots the ability to become thoroughly pervasive and to certify a large interactivity interfaces. This platform addresses the basic and new concept of PCRNet (Pervasive Collaborative Robot NETwork) based on PixRob (Pervasive mIXed reality environment of ROBot), as a remote environment of the deployed robots.","Collaborative work; Human-machine and human-robot interactions; Pervasive grid computing; Robotics and mobile robots; Telepresence","Grid computing; Groupware; Human computer interaction; Information technology; Intelligent robots; Man machine systems; Mobile robots; Robotics; Ubiquitous computing; Virtual reality; Visual communication; Collaborative development; Collaborative robots; Collaborative Work; Future trends; Grid infrastructures; Group work; Heterogeneous resources; Human -robot interactions; Human machine interaction; Human-machine; Intelligent devices; Interactivity; Mediated interaction; Mixed-reality environment; Multiple operator; Multiple robot; New structures; Pervasive grid computing; Pervasive grids; Real environments; Remote environment; Remote robot; Research areas; Telepresence; Work environments; Human robot interaction","","","","","","","Waldron K., Schmiedeler J., Kinematics, Springer Handbook of Robotics, pp. 9-33, (2008); World robotics 2008.

The features of agents including autonomous and distributed are designed to address the federation problems in grid, such as resource selection and policy reconciliation. Early work of resource federation is still highly depending on resource administrator (a person who manages the resources for corresponding institute). In this paper, automated agent negotiation in grid is presented to maximize the satisfaction level of federation outcome for involving parties. Using a new conflict resolution techniquecreative negotiation, is introduced in solving communication problems during negotiation. A framework of automated negotiation with conflict resolutionselect, match, negotiate and expand (SMNE) protocol, is proposed to guide resource administrators in performing resource federation with intelligent agent. According to the experimental result, the proposed SMNE protocol is able to guide resource administrator in conflict resolution when negotiated parties are unable to make further a concession in resource federation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

DL lies in image-based detection and instance segmentation of an entity, which is a critical issue that needs further investigation. This paper aims to study the fundamental challenges in using object instance segmentation of images. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for multi-object image instance segmentation algorithm in three stages. A novel backbone approach improves the image recognition algorithm by extracting low and high characteristic levels from the given images in the first stage. The ResNet is the fundamental building block and connects with the Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet) for each ResNet block. The Region Proposal Network (RPN) is used to determine the object item’s placement, followed by the third stage, which suggests an average position RoI layer to choose the optimal boundaries of the instance segmentation. The experiments are conducted and validated using a standard benchmark image dataset, called COCO. The proposed algorithm’s performance is validated using standard evaluation criteria and compared against the recent image segmentation algorithms that use object instances. The results show that the proposed algorithm gets better results than other well-known instance segmentation algorithms in terms of average accuracy over IoU (AP) threshold measures using various thresholds. © 2021, Scientific Research Support Fund of Jordan.

The grid services are designed to support a variety of data grid applications (jobs) and projects. Replica selection is a high-level service that chooses a replica location from among many distributed replicas with the minimum response time for the users' jobs. Estimating the response time accurately in the grid environment is not an easy task. The current systems expose high response time in selecting the required replicas because the response time is estimated by considering the data transfer time only. Approach: We proposed a replica selection system that selects the best replica location for the users' running jobs in a minimum response time that can be estimated by considering new factors besides the data transfer time, namely, the storage access latency and the replica requests that waiting in the storage queue. Results: The performance of the proposed system was compared with a similar system that exists in the literature namely, SimpleOptimiser. The simulation results demonstrated that our system performed better than the SimpleOptimiser on an average of 6%. Conclusions: The proposed system can select the best replica location in a lesser response time than the SimpleOptimise. The efficiency of the proposed system is 6% higher than the SimpleOptimise. The efficiency level has a high impact on the quality of service that is perceived by grid users in a data grid environment where the data files are relatively big. For example, the data files produced from the scientific applications are of the size hundreds of Terabytes. © 2008 Science Publication.","Data grid; Replica selection decision; Response time estimation","","","","","","","","Zhou X.L., Kim E., Kim J.W., Yeom H.Y., ReCon: A fast and reliable replica retrieval service for the data grid, Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid (CCGRID'06), 1, pp. 446-453, (2006); Sulistio A., Yeo C.S., Buyya R., A taxonomy of computer-based simulations and its mapping to parallel and distributed systems simulation tools, Software Practice Experience, 34, pp. 653-673, (2004); Vazhkudai S., Tuecke S., Foster I., Replica selection in the globus data grid, Proceedings of the 1st International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid, (2001); Ho T., Abramson D., The griddles data replication service, Proceeding of the 1st International Conference on E-Science and Grid Computing (E-Science'05), (2005); Sayal M., Scheuermann P., Vingralek R., Content replication in web++, Proceedings of the 2nd IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA'03), (2003); Vazhkudai S., Schopf J.M., Using regression techniques to predict large data transfers, Int.

This research introduces a GAN architecture based on data augmentation, in order to make the model fulfill 1-Lipschitz constraints, it proposes to consider these additional data included into the penalty areas which can improve ability of discriminator and generator. With the help of these techniques, compared with previous model Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) and Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP), the model proposed in this research can get lower Frechet Inception Distance score (FID) score 2.973 and 2.941 on celebA and LSUN towers at 64×64 resolution respectively which proves that this model can produce high visual quality results. © 2023, Zarka Private University.

It is one of the data mining techniques is an unsupervised learning. In a grid environment, the number of computing nodes and users may reach up to thousands or millions. The grid is said to be dynamic in that the behaviors and values of these resources change all the time. Hence, these data are not suitable to be processed in an off-line mode. The existing clustering techniques today however emphasize more on the data's behaviors categorization but not the data's stability. Furthermore, the normal clustering techniques are more suitable to be used for static data type in an off-line mode. This paper addresses these issues by presenting an Evolving Clustering (Evoc Algorithm) which is an improved version of Evolving Clustering Method (ECM). We apply both methods on CPU usage to identify computers behaviors. The algorithm has been evaluated using three main criteria; that is dynamicity, accuracy and the ability to identify the stable cluster members. Our results show the improvements of the algorithm to process the data in an on-line mode in the evaluation of the algorithm's dynamicity and accuracy criteria compare to other existing clustering techniques. Furthermore, the stability evaluation was a success where we were able to identify the stable cluster members from the filtered stable clusters. However, the result was highly affected by three factors namely threshold value, stability value and stability hour.","Clustering; Data stability; Evolving clustering (Evoc); Evolving clustering method (ECM); Grid","","","","","","","","Foster I., Kesselman C., The Grid: Blueprint for the New Computing Infrastructure, (1998); Chen M.S., Han J., Yu P.S., Data Mining: An Overview from database perspective, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Eng., pp. 866-883, (1996); Jain A.K., Murty M.N., Flynn P.J., Data Clustering: A Review, ACM Computing Surveys, 31, 3, pp. 264-323, (1999); Dinda P.A., The Statistical Properties of Host Load, Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Languages, Compilers, (1998); Guha S., Rastogi R., Shim K., CURE: An efficient clustering algorithm for large databases, Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 73-84, (1998); Karypis G., Han E.-H., Kumar V., CHAMELEON: A hierarchical clustering algorithm using dynamic modeling, COMPUTER, (1999); Kaufman L., Rousseeuw P.J., Finding Groups in Data: An Introduction to Cluster Analysis, (1990); Jain A.K., Dubes R.C., Algorithms for Clustering Data, (1988); Ng R.T., Han J., Member, IEEE Computer Society, CLARANS: A Method for Clustering Objects for Spatial Data Mining, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 14, 5, pp. 1003-1016, (2002); Heer J., Chi Ed.H., Mining the Structure of User Activity using Cluster Stability, Proceedings of the Web Analytics Workshop, SIAM Conference on Data Mining, (2002); Ben-Hur A., Elisseff A., Guyon I., A Stability Based Method for Discovering Structure in Clustered Data, Proceedings of the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB2002), (2002); Song Q., Kasabov N., Dynamic Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (DENFIS): On-line Learning and Application for Time-Series Prediction,  International Conference on Soft Computing, pp. 696-701, (2000); Kasabov N., Song Q., DENFIS: Dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system and its application for time-series prediction, Fuzzy Systems, IEEE Transactions, 10, 2, pp. 144-154, (2002); Yaik O.B., Yong C.H., Haron F., CPU Usage Pattern Discovery Using Suffix Tree. 2<sup>nd</sup> International Conference on Distributed Frameworks for Multimedia Applications, Distributed Frameworks for Multimedia Application 2006, pp. 14-21, (2006); Wolski R., Spring N., Hayes J., Predicting the CPU Availability of Time-shared Unix Systems on the Computational Grid, Proceedings of 8tj High-performance Distributed Computing Systems Conference, (1999)","C.H.

The Dynamic Service Placement and Replication (DSPR) framework is designed to manage services on distributed environment by repetitively searching for the best combination of distributed machines from a resource pool until the best working group is attained to satisfy the requirements of the service. In this research, a fuzzy logic based resource evaluation technique is proposed for the DSPR framework. The proposed technique is then compared with existing resource evaluation methods such as rule-based, utility-based and constraint-based. Besides that, the ability of DSPR to increase service availability in the event of multiple continuous failures is measured. The performance difference between using DSPR and conventional system with failover capability in the event of disaster was carried out. These experiments justify the suitability of using the proposed resource evaluation techniques compare to the existing work. © 2011 IEEE.","dynamic service placement and replication; fuzzy logic; resource evaluation; service availability","Constraint-based; Conventional systems; Core components; Distributed environments; Dynamic services; Failover; Resource evaluation; Resource selection; Rule based; Service availability; Working groups; Fuzzy logic","","","","","","","Armbrust M., Fox A., Griffith R., Joseph A.D., Katz R., Konwinski A., Lee G., Patterson D., Rabkin A., Stoica I., Zaharia M., A view of cloud computing, Commun.

Ontology is one of the major cornerstones of representing the information in a more meaningful way on the semantic Web. The current ontology repositories are quite limited either for their scope or for currentness. In addition, the current ontology extraction systems have many shortcomings and drawbacks, such as using a small dataset, depending on a large amount predefined patterns to extract semantic relations, and extracting a very few types of relations. The aim of this paper is to introduce a proposal of automatically extracting semantic concepts and relations from scientific publications. This paper introduces a novel relevance measurement for concepts, and it suggests new types of semantic relations. Also, it points out of using deep learning (DL) models for semantic relation extraction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Concept extraction; Deep learning; Ontology construction; Relevance measurements; Semantic relation discovery","Extraction; Large dataset; Ontology; Ontology Extraction; Ontology repositories; Scientific publications; Semantic concept; Semantic relation extractions; Semantic relations; Types of relations; Unstructured data; Deep learning","","","","","","","Mishra S., Jain S., A study of various approaches and tools on ontology, IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology (CICT), pp. 57-61, (2015); Maimon O., Browarnik A., Ontology learning from text: Why the ontology learning layer cake is not viable, Int.

To enhance the performance of MBO algorithm, harmony search (HS) is introduced as a mutation operator during the adjusting operator of MBO. A novel hybrid metaheuristic optimization method, the so-called HMBO, is introduced to find the best solution for the global optimization problems. HMBO combines HS exploration with MBO exploitation, and therefore, it produces potential candidate solutions. The implementation process for enhancing MBO method is also presented. To evaluate the effectiveness of this improvement, fourteen standard benchmark functions are used. The mean and the best performance of these benchmark functions in 20, 50, and 100 dimensions demonstrated that HMBO often performs better than the original MBO and other population-based optimization algorithms such as ACO, BBO, DE, ES, GAPBIL, PSO and SGA. Moreover, the t-test result proved that the performance differences between the enhanced HMBO and the original MBO as well as the other optimization methods are statistically significant. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Evolutionary computation; Harmony search; Monarch butterfly optimization; Optimization","Benchmarking; Evolutionary algorithms; Global optimization; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Global numerical optimizations; Global optimization problems; Harmony search; Hybrid Meta-heuristic; Implementation process; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Optimization algorithms; Population-based optimization; Ant colony optimization","","","","","","","Yang X.S., Nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, (2010); Michalewicz Z., Fogel D.B., How to solve it: modern heuristics, (2013); Van Laarhoven P.J., Aarts E.H., Simulated annealing, Simulated annealing theory and applications, pp. 7-15, (1987); Wang G., Guo L., Wang H., Duan H., Liu L., Li J., Incorporating mutation scheme into krill herd algorithm for global numerical optimization, Neural Comput Appl, 24, 3-4, pp. 853-871, (2014); Gandomi A.H., Yang X.S., Talatahari S., Alavi A.H., Metaheuristic applications in structures and infrastructures, (2013); Yang X.S., Deb S., Hanne T., He X., Attraction and diffusion in nature-inspired optimization algorithms, Neural Comput Appl, 24, pp. 1-8, (2015); Ouaarab A., Ahiod B., Yang X.S., Discrete cuckoo search algorithm for the travelling salesman problem, Neural Comput Appl, 24, 7-8, pp. 1659-1669, (2014); Yang X.S., Gandomi A.H., Talatahari S., Alavi A.H., Metaheuristics in water, geotechnical and transport engineering, (2012); Horst R., Tuy H., Global optimization: deterministic approaches, (2013); Ding S., Zhang Y., Chen J., Jia W., Research on using genetic algorithms to optimize Elman neural networks, Neural Comput Appl, 23, 2, pp. 293-297, (2013); Mitchell M., An introduction to genetic algorithms, (1998); Zhao M., Ren J., Ji L., Fu C., Li J., Zhou M., Parameter selection of support vector machines and genetic algorithm based on change area search, Neural Comput Appl, 21, 1, pp. 1-8, (2012); Khatib W., Fleming P.J., The stud GA: A mini revolution?, In: International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature.

Such elasticity reflects the fluctuation of resource provisioning due to the variety of service demands. Most high-demanding services adopt a multi-tier architecture. However, offering quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee for these services with least resource usage costs under dynamic and unpredictable workloads and different resource demands is a significantly complex problem. Therefore, cloud providers (CPs) need to adopt a dynamic resource optimization and provisioning framework. Numerous rule-based and model-based approaches have been designed for dynamic resource provisioning in virtualized data centers. However, these approaches mainly focus on providing service-level QoS guarantees for running services and most of them do not address mainly the problem of minimizing the number of running virtual machines in order to increase CP profit. This research proposes a new resource optimization and provisioning (ROP) framework to detect, solve the bottlenecks, and satisfy the service-level QoS requirements of running services and to increase the CP profits. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ROP against other approaches, a prototype running on a cloud platform is developed, and a workload generator and multi-tier service model are adopted. Results show that the ROP framework outperforms other existing approaches by 75% in terms of on-demand service configurations while providing service-level QoS guarantee for running services. © 2017, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.","Case-based reasoning; Multi-tier cloud service; Quality of service; Resource management","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6313168)","Acknowledgements This research has been funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) under USM short-term Grant 304/PKOMP/6313168.","Ghetas M., Yong C.H., Sumari P., A survey of quality of service in multi-tier web applications, KSII Trans.

Day traders and technical analysts rely on market sentiment, as it influences the price movement of a stock. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing approach to analyze market sentiment. In this work, we analyze the effect of the news on stock price trends on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange or Bursa Malaysia. Specifically, we analyze the financial news headlines involving one or more listed companies and determine whether it will move the stock price up, down, or flat. We propose a deep neural network architecture with name attention to model the relationship between a news headline and the stock price trend. The main idea of the approach is to focus on the target company in the headline when modeling the relationship between a headline and the stock trend using attention. The experiment result shows that the proposed approach performs better than other baseline approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Deep neural networks; Name attention; Stock price trend","Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Network architecture; Sentiment analysis; Language processing; Learning models; Name attention; Natural languages; Price movement; Price trends; Processing approach; Sentiment analysis; Stock price; Stock price trend; Deep neural networks","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme FRGS/1/2021/ICT02/USM/02/4 from Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia.","Lim S.L.O., Lim H.M., Tan E.K., Tan T.-P., Examining machine learning techniques in business news headline sentiment analysis, Alfred R, Lim Y, Haviluddin H, on C (Eds) Computational Science and Technology.

However, drilling is costly and time consuming, thus affecting productivity. This research aims to develop an alternative method to drilling. In this paper, the precision of the holes was measured and the effects of the die clearance to the areas around the holes were evaluated. Measurement and evaluation were performed based on the profile of the holes constructed using Alicona IFM, a 3D surface measurement technique. Results showed that punching is a potential alternative to drilling but still requires improvements. © 2017 Author(s).","","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors want to acknowledge Universiti Sains Malaysia for their sponsorship through Research University Grant (Acc.

In MBO, there are mainly two processes. In the first process, the algorithm emulates how some of the butterflies move from the current position to the new position by the migration operator. In the latter process, the algorithm tunes the position of other butterflies by adjusting operator. In order to enhance the search ability of MBO, an innovation method called MBHS is introduced to tackle the optimization problem. In MBHS, the harmony search (HS) adds mutation operators to the process of adjusting operator to enhance the exploitation, exploration ability, and speed up the convergence rate of MBO. For the purpose to validate the performance of MBHS, 14 benchmark functions are used, and the performance is compared with well-known search algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that MBHS performs better than the basic MBO and other algorithms. © 2015 IEEE.","butterfly optimization; Evolutionary computation; Harmony search","Algorithms; Benchmarking;

Identifying the relevant concepts is considered one of the main challenges of automatic ontology construction (called Ontology Learning (OL)). This research introduces a novel relevance metric that estimates the sustainability distribution of concepts to identify the modern and relevant concepts, called Domain Time Relevance (DTR). Also, this research proposes a Developed Concepts extraction Model based on the proposed DTR, namely DTR-DCEM. This proposed model uses the proposed Concepts extraction stopwords (CE-stopwords) list to avoid noise data. This proposed model, DTR-DCEM, aims to extract the relevant concepts from scientific publications. The experiments are conducted in two different datasets: DL2019 and ACLRelAcS. The experimental results show that the proposed model DTR-DCEM outperforms the state-of-the-art models. It got between (3.32∼51.07)% better performance than comparative models for the DL2019 dataset and between (3.29∼24.51)% better performance for the ACLRelAcS dataset.

One of the grid computing purposes is to share computational resources. The efficiency and effectiveness of resource utilization of a grid greatly depend on the scheduler algorithm. The scheduler will be able to manage the grid resources more effectively if we able to predict and provide it with the future state of grid resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a model to perform time series prediction using adaptive association rules. This model uses the idea that if a segment of a repeatable time series pattern has occurred, it has the possibility that the following segments of the repeatable pattern will appear. Data mining and pattern matching techniques are being applied to mine for repeatable time series patterns. This model has the ability to provide confident level for each prediction it made and perform continuous adaptation. A prototype of this model is being developed and tested with four test cases. These test cases are relatively simple because our work on this time series prediction using adaptive association rules is very much in its early stages. The result from the experiment shows that our model is able to capture repetitive time series patterns and perform prediction using those patterns. However, this model has some drawbacks such as it required high computational power and required large storage.","","Adaptive algorithms; Computational complexity; Data mining; Data recording; Mathematical models; Time series analysis; Adaptive association rules; Distributed systems; Grid computing; Schedular algorithms; Distributed computer systems","","","","","","","Koskela T., Varsta M., Heikkonen J., Kaski K., Time series prediction using recurrent SOM with local linear models, Research Report, B15, (1997); Kamitsuji S., Shibata R., Effectiveness of stochastic neural network for prediction of fall or rise of TOPIX, Research Paper, (2004); Kasabov N., Evolving Connectionist Systems, (2003); Wolski R., Dynamically forecasting network performance using the network weather service, Journal of Cluster Computing, 1, pp. 119-132, (1998); Wolski R., Spring N., Hayes J., The network weather service: A distributed resource performance forecasting service for metacomputing, Journal of Future Generation Computing Systems, 15, 5-6, pp. 757-768, (1999); Elmasri R., Navathe S.B.,  Edition, pp. 867-897, (2004); Wei W.W.S., Time Series Analysis: Univariate and Multivariate Methods, (1999)","O.B.

It discusses the characteristics of classical authorization system and requirements of the authorization system in pervasive grid environment as well. Based on our analysis of current systems and taking into account the main requirements of such pervasive environment, we propose new authorization system architecture as an extension of the existing grid authorization mechanisms. This architecture not only supports user attributes but also context attributes which act as a key concept for context-awareness thought. The architecture allows authorization of users dynamically when there are changes in the pervasive grid environment. For this, we opt for hybrid authorization method that integrates push and pull mechanisms to combine the existing grid authorization attributes with dynamic context assertions. We will investigate the proposed architecture using a real testing environment that includes heterogeneous pervasive grid infrastructures mapped over multiple virtual organizations. Various scenarios are described in the last section of the article to strengthen the proposed mechanism with different facilities for the authorization procedure.","Authorization System; Contextawareness; Pervasive Grid; Ubiquity","Architecture; Authorization procedure; Authorization systems; Context attributes; Context-Aware; Contextawareness; Current system; Dynamic contexts; Pervasive environments; Pervasive grid computing; Pervasive grids; Proposed architectures; Testing environment; Ubiquity; Virtual organization; Grid computing","","","","","","","Foster I., Kesselman C., Tuecke S., The Anatomy of the Grid: Enabling Scalable Virtual Organizations, International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications, 15, 3, pp. 200-222, (2001); Chin J., Zhang N., Nenadic A., Bamasak O., A context-constrained authorisation (cocoa) framework for pervasive grid computing, Wireless Networks; Parashar M., Pierson J.-M., Pervasive Grids: Challenges and Opportunities, Handbook of Research on Scalable Computing Technologies; Chakrabarti A., Grid Authorization System, Grid Computing Security, (2007); Robert Carter G., Authentication vs. Authorization, (2010); Tanenbaum A.S., van Steen M., Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms, (2002); Alfieri R., Cecchini R., Ciaschini V., dell' Agnello L., Frohner A., Et al., VOMS, an Authorization System for Virtual Organizations, Proceedings of the 1st European Across Grids Conference, (2003); Lorch M., Cowles B., Baker R., Gommans L., Madsen P., McNab A., Ramakrishnan L., Sankar K., Skow D., Thompson M.R., Conceptual Grid Authorization Framework and Classification, Authrization Frameworks and Mechanisms-WG, (2004); Parashar M., Pierson J.-M., Pervasive Grids: Challenges and Opportunities, Handbook of Research on Scalable Computing Technologies, (2009); Sun H.-M., Wang K.-H., Kebbeh P.S., Distributed Authorization and Authentication Framework for a Grid Infrastructure, (2007); Shengjian L.I.U., A study on the Mechanisms of Policy-based Grid Authorization, 2009 International Conference on multimedia Information Networking and Security, (2009); Chadwick A., Otenko D.W., The PERMIS X. 509 Role Based Privilege Management Infrastructure, Proc. of 7th ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies, (2002); Koufi V., Vassilacopoulos G., Context-Aware Access Control for Pervasive Access to Process-based Healthcare Systems, Eealth the Horizon-Get IT, (2008); Koufi V., Vassilacopoulos G., Context-Aware Access Control for Pervasive Access to Process-based Healthcare Systems, Eealth the Horizon-Get IT, (2008)","M.

This paper describes a rank aggregation model that incorporates text analysis measure with existing rankbased method, e.g. Best Rank and Borda Rank, to aggregate search results from various search systems. This approach provides means to normalize the differences of rank methodology used by different search systems, justifying the potential of using contents analysis to improve the results relevancy in meta search. In this paper, we fully describe our approach on text normalization for meta search and present our rationality of using two rankbased methods in our model. We then evaluate and benchmark the performance of our model based on user judgment on results relevancy. Our experiment results show that when text analysis factor is taken into account, the results outperform the rank-based methods alone. This shows the potential of our model to complement current rank aggregation methods used in meta search. © 2005 by International Federation for Information Processing.","Information retrieval; Meta search; Normalization; Ranking; Search results aggregation","Benchmarking; Information retrieval; Meta search; Model-based OPC; Normalization; Problem domain; Rank aggregation; Ranking; Text analysis; Text normalizations; Safety devices","","","","","","","Jansen B.J., The effect of query complexity on Web searching results, Information Research, 6, 1, (2000); Jansen B.J., Spink A., Saracevic T., Real life, real users, and real needs: A study and analysis of user queries on the web, Information Processing and Management, 36, 2, pp. 207-227, (2000); Ricardo B.Y., Berthier R.N., Modern Information Retrieval, (1999); Dwork C., Kumar R., Naor M., Sivakumar D., Rank Aggregation Methods for the Web, WWWIO, (2001); Harman D., The Development and Evolution of TREC and DUC, NTCIR Workshop, (2003); Sullivan D., Search Engine Watch: Major Search Engines and Directories, (2003); Voorhess E.M., The Philosophy of Information Retrieval Evaluation, 2nd Workshop of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum, CLEF 2001, pp. 355-370, (2001); Aslam J.A., Montague M., Model for Metasearch, SIGIR'Ol, pp. 276-284, (2001); Renda M.E., Straccia U., Web Metasearch: Rank vs. Score Based Rank Aggregation Methods, SAC2003, (2003); Mahabhashyam M.S., Singitham P., Tadpole: A Meta search engine, (2002)","","","Springer New York LLC","Chinese Association of Artificial Intelligence; IFIP TC12/WG12.3; The China Computer Federation","IFIP TC12/WG12.3 International Conference on Intelligent Information Processing, IIP 2004","21 October 2004 through 23 October 2004","Beijing","105755","18684238","038723151X; 978-038723151-8","","","English","IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902472994"

Ontology learning (OL) from text is a process that aims to (semi-) automatically extract and represent the knowledge from text in machine-readable form. Ontology is considered one of the main cornerstones of representing the knowledge in a more meaningful way on the semantic web. Usage of ontologies has proven to be beneficial and efficient in different applications (e.g. information retrieval, information extraction, and question answering). Nevertheless, manually construction of ontologies is time-consuming as well extremely laborious and costly process. In recent years, many approaches and systems that try to automate the construction of ontologies have been developed. This paper reviews various approaches, systems, and challenges of automatic ontology construction from the text. In addition, it also discusses ways the ontology construction process could be enhanced in the future by presenting techniques from shallow learning to deep learning (DL). © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Concept classification; Deep learning; Ontology construction; Ontology learning; Semantic relation","Ontology; Semantic Web; Automatic ontology; Concept classification; Explosive growth; Machine readable form; Ontology construction; Ontology learning; Question Answering; Semantic relations; Deep learning","","","","","","","Abney S., Part-of-speech tagging and partial parsing, Corpus-based methods in language and speech processing, pp. 118-136, (1997); Albukhitan S., Helmy T., Alnazer A., Arabic ontology learning using deep learning, Proceedings of the International Conference on Web Intelligence, (2017); Arel I., Rose D.C., Karnowski T.P., Deep machine learning—a new frontier in artificial intelligence research [research frontier], IEEE Comput Intell Mag, 5, pp. 13-18, (2010); Arguello Casteleiro M., Maseda Fernandez D., Demetriou G., Warren R., Fernandez-Prieto M.J., des Diz J., Nenadic G., Keane J., Robert S., A Case Study on Sepsis Using Pubmed and Deep Learning for Ontology Learning.

Resource prediction can be used to enhance scheduler effectiveness on their scheduling strategies and resource allocation. The prediction results can also be used by the applications to adjust themselves to suit the resource availability to get better performance. In this paper, we use a suffix tree to discover CPU usage patterns to find opportunities for exploiting the available CPU resources. We introduced a prediction strategy that uses discovered frequent patterns to predict CPU load. We defined that a CPU usage behavior as a set of CPU usage patterns. Our experiment results showed that CPU usage does exhibit certain behavior and our model is capable of discovering the usage and utilized it to perform prediction. The discovered patterns are interesting because some of the discovered cyclic patterns seem to be related to users' usage behaviour. In order to justify our model prediction capability, we compared our prediction model with the state-of-the-art methods such as Network Weather Services. © 2006 IEEE.","","Arts computing; Computer networks; Distributed computer systems; Mathematical models; Metropolitan area networks; Multimedia systems; Neodymium; Network protocols; Planning; Resource allocation; Scheduling; CPU resources; Cyclic patterns; Distributed frameworks; Experiment results; Frequent patterns; In order; international conferences; model predictions; multimedia applications; prediction modeling; resource availabilities; Resource prediction; Resource-sharing; Scheduling strategies; State-of-the-art methods; Suffix trees; Usage patterns; Weather services; Forecasting","","","","","","","Foster I., Kesselman C., The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastucture, (1998); Yang L., Foster I., Schopf J.M., Homeostatic and Tendency-based CPU Load Predictions, Proceedings of IPDPS 2003, (2002); Wu M., Sun X.-H., A General Self-adaptive Task Scheduling System for Non-dedicated Heterogeneous Computing, Cluster Computing 2003.

However, most of these algorithms aim to improve service performance or to reduce operation cost and do not consider the reliability and availability of their resources. Most of them do not consider events when machines in their resource pool malfunction. These malfunctioned machines could cause services to halt or, worse, to produce transient and intermittent errors. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic service placement and redundancy (DSPR) concept to manage service placement and replicas to achieve high availability and that is capable of detecting and recovering from arbitrary faults. The DSPR algorithm will autonomously look for opportunities to ensure service availability by migrating services to hosts with better performance and availability.

Most of these services use multi-tier architecture for flexible scaling and software reusability. However, managing the performance of multi-tier web services under dynamic and unpredictable workload, and different resource demands in each tier is a critical problem for a service provider. When offering quality of service assurance with least resource usage costs, web service providers should adopt self-adaptive resource provisioning in each tier. Recently, a number of rule- and model-based approaches have been designed for dynamic resource management in virtualized data centers. This survey investigates the challenges of resource provisioning and provides a competing assessment on the existing approaches. After the evaluation of their benefits and drawbacks, the new research direction to improve the efficiency of resource management and recommendations are introduced. © 2016 KSII.","Cloud computing; Multi-tier Application; Quality of service; Resource management","Client server computer systems; Cloud computing; Computer software reusability; Information management; Natural resources management; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Reusability; Surveys; Telecommunication services; Websites; Dynamic resource management; Model based approach; Multi tier architecture; Multi-tier applications; Quality of service assurances; Resource management; Virtualized data centers; Web service providers; Web services","","","","","","","Douglas, Barry K., Web Services, Service-Oriented Architectures, and Cloud Computing: The Savvy Manager's Guide, (2003); Fielding R.T., Kaiser G., The Apache HTTP Server Project, IEEE Internet Computing, 1, 4, pp. 88-90, (1997); Tomcat 6.0.44; The Java Community Process Program; Menasc D.A., Almeida V.A.F., Dowdy Larry W., Capacity Planning for Web Services: Metrics, Models, and Methods, (2002); Kleinrock, Leonard, Queuing Systems, 2, (1976); Chandra A., Gong W., Shenoy P., Dynamic resource allocation for shared data centers using online measurements, Proc. of Quality of Service—IWQoS 2003, pp. 381-398, (2003); Xiong P., Wang Z., Jung G., Pu C., Study on performance management and application behavior in virtualized environment, Proc. of Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS), 2010 IEEE, pp. 841-844, (2010); Urgaonkar B., Pacifici G., Shenoy P., Spreitzer M., Tantawi A., An Analytical Model for Multi-Tier Internet Services and Its Applications, Proc. of ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review, 33, pp. 291-302, (2005); (2012); Wei J., Cheng-Zhong X., EQoS: Provisioning of client-perceived end-to-end QoS guarantees in web servers, Computers, IEEE Transactions, 55, 12, pp. 1543-1556, (2006); Liu X., Sha L., Diao Y., Froehlich S., Hellerstein J.L., Parekh S., Online response time optimization of apache web server, Proc. of Quality of Service—IWQoS 2003, pp. 461-478, (2003); Zhou D., Huang W.W., Using a fuzzy classification approach to assess e-commerce web sites: An empirical investigation, ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT), 9, 3, (2009); Diao Y., Hellerstein J.L., Parekh S., Optimizing quality of service using fuzzy controlManagement Technologies for E-Commerce and E-Business Applications, pp. 42-53, (2002); Lama P., Zhou X., Autonomic provisioning with self-adaptive neural fuzzy control for percentile-based delay guarantee, ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS), 8, 2, (2013); Rao J., Wei Y., Gong J., Cheng-Zhong X., Qos guarantees and service differentiation for dynamic cloud applications, Network and Service Management, IEEE Transactions, 10, 1, pp. 43-55, (2013); Maurer M., Brandic I., Sakellariou R., Self-adaptive and resource-efficient SLA enactment for cloud computing infrastructures, Proc. of Cloud Computing (CLOUD), 2012 IEEE 5Th International Conference On, pp. 368-375, (2012); Lama P., Zhou X., Efficient server provisioning with control for end-to-end response time guarantee on multitier clusters, Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions On, 23, 1, pp. 78-86, (2012); Wang L., Jing X., Zhao M., Yicheng T., Fortes J.A.B., Fuzzy modeling based resource management for virtualized database systems, Proc. of Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS), 2011 IEEE 19Th International Symposium On, pp. 32-42, (2011); Martinez J.F., Ipek E., Dynamic multicore resource management: A machine learning approach, Micro, IEEE, 29, 5, pp. 8-17, (2009); Tesauro G., Jong N.K., Das R., Bennani M.N., A hybrid reinforcement learning approach to autonomic resource allocation, Proc. of Autonomic Computing, 2006.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology provides the infrastructure and methodology of using this idle power which is otherwise not fully utilized. Compute Power Market (CPM) has been proposed to bring together the providers and users of computing power in a systematic manner. This paper discusses our effort at developing a CPM/P2P framework, based on JXTA which is one of the latest P2P technology.

For this purpose, two sets of punchers were fabricated and the punching process was carried out using universal testing machine. The images of the punched holes are scanned using a high-resolution camera, and then the holes are analysed using the developed algorithm based on image processing technique. Quality is measured based on complete shearing and roundness of the hole top and bottom surface. Results show that dual-stages puncher, which allow for lower die clearance, indicate better in terms of accuracy of the punched hole. In addition, it may decrease the required load to implement the operation. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Composites panel; Multi-stage puncher; Punching; Roundness","","","","","","","","Ali H.M., Iqbal A., Liang L., A comparative study on the use of drilling and milling processes in hole making of GFRP composite, Sadhana, 38, 4, pp. 743-760, (2013); Al-Momani E., Rawabdeh I., An application of finite element method and design of experiments in the optimization of sheet metal blanking process, Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, 2, 1, pp. 53-63, (2008); Botelho E.C., Silva R.A., Pardini L.C., Rezende M.C., A review on the development and properties of continuous fiber/epoxy/aluminum hybrid composites for aircraft structures, Material Research, 9, 3, pp. 247-256, (2006); Campbell F.C., Composite Materials, (2010); Desai B., Rana J., Gajera H., Study of the hole quality parameters in drilling of CFRP using design of experiment, Journal of Information, Knowledge and Research in Mechanical Engineering, 2, 2, pp. 461-465, (2013); Edward T., Composite materials revolutionize aerospace engineering, Ingenia, 36, 36, pp. 24-28, (2008); Evci C., Gulgec M., An experimental investigation on the impact response of composite materials, International Journal of Impact Engineering, 43, pp. 40-51, (2012); Isbilir O., Ghassemieh E., Finite element analysis of drilling of carbon fibre reinforced composites, Applied Composite Materials, 19, 3-4, pp. 637-656, (2012); Luis M.P.D., Joao M.R.S.T., Antonio G.M., Antonio T.M., Antonio P.M.B., Damage analysis of carbon/epoxy plates after drilling, International Journal of Materials and Product Technology, 32, 2-3, pp. 226-242, (2008); Mayyas A., Qasaimeh A., Alzoubi K., Lu S., Hayajneh M., Hassan A., Modeling the drilling process of aluminum composites using multiple regression analysis and artificial neural networks, Journal of Minerals and Materials Characterization and Engineering, 11, 10, pp. 1039-1049, (2012); Mohd Ariffin M.K.A., Mohd Ali M.I., Sapuan S.M., Ismail N., An optimize drilling process for an aircraft composite structure using design of experiment, Scientific Research and Essay, 4, 10, pp. 1109-1116, (2009); Phadnis V.A., Roy A., Silberschmidt V.V., Finite element analysis of drilling in carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 382, (2014); Qiao J.W., Ye H.Y., Yang H.J., Liang W., Xu B.S., Liaw P.K., Chen M.W., Dynamic shear punching of metallic glass matrix composites, Intermetallics, 36, pp. 31-35, (2013); Rahme P., Landon Y., Lachaud F., Piquet R., Lagarrigue P., Analytical models of composite material drilling, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 52, 5-8, pp. 609-617, (2011); Suchy I., Handbook of Die Design, (2006); Vankanti V.K., Ganta V., Optimization of process parameters in drilling of GFRP composite using Taguchi method, Journal of Materials Research and Technology, 3, 1, pp. 35-41, (2014); Zhang H.L., Chen J., Finite element method simulation of drilling on metal matrix composites, Advanced Materials Research, 188, pp. 372-375, (2011)","A.B.

However, most of these algorithms aim to improve service performance or to reduce operation cost and do not consider the reliability and availability of their resources. Most of them do not consider events when machines in their resource pool malfunction. These malfunctioned machines could cause services to halt or, worse, to produce transient and intermittent errors. Presently, most of the solutions proposed to improve service availability are based on having redundancy units that do not consider the amount of work and resources needed to create replicas, which greatly increases the complexity of the management of a distributed system. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art techniques that could improve service availability in distributed environments and propose an autonomic algorithm based on team building concept that dynamically performs service placement to improve service availability even in the event of resource failures. © 2010 IEEE.","Autonomic computing; Resource availability; Resource management; Service placement","Information technology; Lakes; Natural resources management; Quality assurance; Redundancy; Resource allocation; Autonomic Computing; Distributed environments; Distributed systems; Dynamic services; Operation cost; Placement algorithm; Reliability and availability; Resource availability; Resource management; Service availability; Service performance; Service placement; Team building; Algorithms","","","","","","","Kephart J.O., Research challenges of autonomic computing, Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Software Engineering, (2005); Sterritt R., Autonomic computing, Innovations Systems Software Engineering, 1, 1, pp. 79-88, (2005); Samuel K., Ramon N., Jordi T., Autonomic QoS-Aware resource management in grid computing using online performance models, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Performance Evaluation Methodologies and Tools, (2007); Folino G., Spezzano G., An autonomic tool for building self-organizing Grid-enabled applications, Future Gener.

For the purpose of identifying concept drift, we suggest a sliding adaptive beta distribution model (SABeDM) in this study. SABeDM combines the adaptive sliding window and beta distribution techniques to track modifications in the underlying distribution of the data stream. Several synthetic and real-world datasets are used to assess the proposed model, and it is then contrasted with cutting-edge drift detection systems. Regarding detecting true positive, false positive, false negative, and delay, our experimental results demonstrate that SABeDM works better than the currently used methods (SRP, ADWIN, DDM, and EDDM). Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were also utilised as evaluation criteria. When used in a variety of applications, such as online learning, data stream mining, and real-time monitoring systems, SABeDM offers an effective and fast way to identify concept drift in a dynamic context. The proposed approach is a promising tool for machine learning practitioners to use in practical applications since it can help to enhance the dependability and accuracy of decision-making systems in dynamic situations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Beta distribution;

These devices, collectively, might possess an enormous amount of valuable data but due to privacy concerns and privacy laws like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), this enormous amount of very valuable data is not available to train models for more accurate and efficient AI applications. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a very prominent collaborative learning technique to learn from such decentralized private data while reasonably satisfying the privacy constraints. To learn from such decentralized and massively distributed data, federated learning needs to overcome some unique challenges like system heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, communication, model heterogeneity, privacy, and security. In this article, to begin with, we explain some fundamentals of federated learning along with the definition and applications of FL. Subsequently, we further explain the unique challenges of FL while critically covering recently proposed approaches to handle them. Furthermore, this paper also discusses some relatively novel challenges for federated learning. To conclude, we discuss some future research directions in the domain of federated learning. © 2021 Materials and Energy Research Center.

This rise in popularity has led to a significant learning challenge known as concept drifting, primarily due to the increasing use of spatial and temporal data streaming applications. Concept drift can have highly negative consequences, leading to the degradation of models used in these applications. A new model called BOASWIN-XGBoost (Bayesian Optimized Adaptive Sliding Window and XGBoost) has been introduced in this work to handle concept drift. This model is designed explicitly for classifying streaming data and comprises three main procedures: pre-processing, concept drift detection, and classification. The BOASWIN-XGBoost model utilizes a method called Bayesian-Optimized Adaptive Sliding Window (BOASWIN) to identify the presence of concept drift in the streaming data. Additionally, it employs an optimized XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model for classification purposes. The hyperparameter tuning approach known as BO-TPE (Bayesian Optimization with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) is employed to fine-tune the XGBoost model's parameters, thus enhancing the classifier's performance. Seven streaming datasets were used to evaluate the proposed approach's performance, including Agrawal_a, Agrawal_g, SEA_a, SEA_g, Hyperplane, Phishing, and Weather. The simulation results demonstrate that the suggested model achieves impressive accuracy values of 70.83%, 71.02%, 76.76%, 76.96%, 84.26%, 95.53%, and 78.35% on the corresponding datasets, affirming its superior performance in handling concept drift and classifying streaming data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bayesian optimization;

However, processing vast amounts of spatiotemporal data out of several sources, such as online traffic, social platforms, sensor networks and other sources, is a considerable challenge. The major goal of this study is to create a framework for processing and analyzing spatiotemporal data from multiple sources with irregular shapes, so that researchers can focus on data analysis instead of worrying about the data sources' structure. We introduced a novel spatiotemporal data paradigm for true-real-time stream processing, which enables high-speed and low-latency real-time data processing, with these considerations in mind. A comparison of two state-of-the-art real-time process architectures was offered, as well as a full review of the various open-source technologies for real-time data stream processing and their system topologies were also presented. Hence, this study proposed a brand-new framework that integrates Apache Kafka for spatiotemporal data ingestion, Apache Flink for true-real-time processing of spatiotemporal stream data, as well as machine learning for real-time predictions and Apache Cassandra at the storage layer for distributed storage in real time. The proposed framework was compared with others from the literature using the following features: Scalability (Sc), prediction tools (PT), data analytics (DA), multiple event types (MET), data storage (DS), Real-time (Rt) and performance evaluation (PE) stream processing (SP) and our proposed framework provided the ability to handle all of these tasks. © 2022, Scientific Research Support Fund of Jordan.

Job Manager: It is the distributed execution's coordination node (master node) that manages the data flow between the slave nodes' task managers. The Task Manager is in charge of executing the operators that receive and produce streams, notifying the Job Manager of their status and exchanging data streams amongst the operators (task managers). Client: It converts computer code into a data-flow graph, which is then sent to the Job Manager to be executed. Flink is a native (true) stream-processing framework that can also handle batch processing, considering each batch as a stream of bounded data. Apache Flink combines stream processing with CEP (Complex-event Processing) [37] technology to provide real-time data analysis and response. Flink allows us to apply transformations to data streams and then analyze the results [38]. Figure 6 shows the ecosystem of flink.","Hiraman B. R., Viresh M. C., Abhijeet C.
