This paper first presents a set of 48 emotion categories discovered inductively from 5,553 annotated tweets through a small-scale content analysis by trained or expert annotators. We then refine the emotion categories to a set of 28 and test how representative they are on a larger set of 10,000 tweets through crowdsourcing. We describe the two-phase methodology used to expose and refine the set of fine-grained emotion categories from tweets, compare the inter-annotator agreement between annotations generated by expert and novice annotators (crowdsourcing) and show that it is feasible to perform fine-grained emotion classification using gold standard data generated from these two phases. Our main goal is to offer a more representative and finer-grained framework of emotions expressed in microblog text, thus allowing study of emotions that are currently underexplored in sentiment analysis. © 2016 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.","","Artificial intelligence; Crowdsourcing; Social networking (online); Content analysis; Emotion classification; Expert and novices; Fine grained; Gold standards; Micro-blog; Sentiment analysis; Small scale; Data mining","","","","","","","Abelson R., Sermat V., Multidimensional scaling of facial expressions, Journal of Experimental Psychology, 63, 6, pp. 546-554, (1962); Alm C., Roth D., Sproat R., Emotions from text: Machine learning for text-based emotion prediction, Proceedings of the Conference on Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 579-586, (2005); Aman S., Szpakowicz S., Identifying expressions of emotion in text, Text, Speech and Dialogue, pp. 196-205, (2007); Averill J.R., A constructivist view of emotion, Emotion: Theory, Research, and Experience, 1, pp. 305-339, (1980); Besnier N., Language and affect, Annual Review of Anthropology, 19, pp. 419-451, (1990); Bollen J., Mao H., Zeng X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market, Journal of Computational Science, 2, 1, pp. 1-8, (2011); Bollen J., Pepe A., Mao H., Modeling public mood and emotion: Twitter sentiment and socio-economic phenomena, Proceedings of the 5th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 450-453, (2011); Bradley M.M., Lang P.J., Measuring emotion: The self-Assessment manikin and the semantic differential, Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 25, 1, pp. 49-59, (1994); Bradley M.M., Lang P.J., Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW): Instruction Manual and Affective Ratings, (1999); Calvo R.A., Kim S.M., Emotions in text: Dimensional and categorical models, Computational Intelligence, 29, 3, pp. 527-543, (2012); Corbin J., Strauss A., Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, (2008); Cornelius R.R., The Science of Emotion: Research and Tradition in the Psychology of Emotions, (1996); Dodds P.S., Danforth C.M., Measuring the happiness of large-scale written expression: Songs, blogs, and presidents, Journal of Happiness Studies, 11, 4, pp. 441-456, (2010); Ekman P., Universals and cultural differences in facial expressions of emotion, Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, 19, pp. 207-283, (1971); Farzindar A., Inkpen D., Natural language processing for social media, Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies, 8, 2, pp. 1-166, (2015); Glaser B.G., Strauss A.L., The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, (1967); Green R.S., Cliff N., Multidimensional comparisons of structures of vocally and facially expressed emotion, Perception & Psychophysics, 17, 5, pp. 429-438, (1975); Kagan J., On emotion and its development: A working paper, The Development of Affect, 1, pp. 11-41, (1978); Yan J.L.S., Fine-Grained Emotion Detection in Microblog Text, (2016); Mohammad S., Zhu X., Martin J., Semantic role labeling of emotions in tweets, Proceedings of the ACL 2014 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment, and Social Media, pp. 32-41, (2014); Nakov P., Kozareva Z., Ritter A., Rosenthal S., Stoyanov V., Wilson T., SemEval-2013 task 2: Sentiment analysis in twitter, Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, 2, pp. 312-320, (2013); Ortony A., Turner T.J., What's basic about basic emotions, Psychological Review, 97, 3, pp. 315-331, (1990); Park M., Cha C., Cha M., Depressive moods of users portrayed in twitter, Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Healthcare Informatics, pp. 1-8, (2012); Platt J.C., Fast training of support vector machines using sequential minimal optimization, Advances in Kernel Methods, pp. 41-65, (1998); Plutchik R., The Emotions: Facts, Theories, and a New Model.

However, current findings reporting the usefulness of sentiment features in cryptocurrency price prediction is still mixed. This paper aims to explore various feature combinations encompassing cryptocurrency historical prices and sentiment scores of the current day aggregated from English and Malay news sources to predict the closing price of the next day. Each news headline related to Bitcoin and Ethereum within the duration of one year is first manually annotated and then aggregated on a daily basis to generate the sentiment features. A Bi-GRU deep learning model is implemented to predict the cryptocurrency closing price of the next day given a combination of historical price and sentiment features of the current day. Our findings evidently show sentiment features when combined with the closing price of the current day contribute significantly to improve the model's performance. Our study is also the first attempt to examine the effect of Malay news sentiment on cryptocurrency prices and we have demonstrated that cryptocurrency price prediction models leveraging Malay news sentiment features for Bitcoin and Ethereum are able to yield performance that is at par with models using English news sentiment features.  © 2022 IEEE.","cryptocurrency; deep learning; feature selection; news headline; price prediction; sentiment","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Costs; Deep learning; Ethereum; 'current; Deep learning; Feature combination; Features selection; Financial community; News headline; News sources; Price prediction; Sentiment; Sentiment features; Forecasting","","","","","","","Goleman T., Cryptocurrency: Mining, Investing and Trading in Blockchain for Beginners, (2018); Nakamoto S., Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Decentralized Business Review, (2008); Pintelas E., Livieris I.E., Stavroyiannis S., Kotsilieris T., Pintelas P., Investigating the problem of cryptocurrency price prediction: A deep learning approach, Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations, 584, pp. 99-110, (2020); Fama E.F., Efficient capital markets: A review of theory and empirical work, The Journal of Finance, 25, 2, pp. 383-417, (1970); Van Horne J.C., Parker G.G.C., The random-walk theory: An empirical test, Financial Analysts Journal, 23, 6, pp. 87-92, (1967); Peters E.E., Fractal Market Analysis: Applying Chaos Theory to Investment and Economics, (1994); Lo A.W., The Adaptive Markets Hypothesis, The Journal of Portfolio Management, 30, 5, pp. 15-29, (2004); Gurdgiev C., O'Loughlin D., Herding and anchoring in cryptocurrency markets: Investor reaction to fear and uncertainty, Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 25, (2020); Dolan R.J., Emotion, Cognition, and Behavior, Science, 298, 5596, pp. 1191-1194, (2002); Deutscher I., Pestello F.P., Pestello H.F.G., Sentiments and Acts, (1993); Hutto C.J., Gilbert E., VADER: A parsimonious rule-based model for sentiment analysis of social media text, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM 2014), (2015); Hochreiter S., Schmidhuber J., Long Short-Term Memory, Neural Computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); Cho K., Van Merrienboer B., Gulcehre C., Bahdanau D., Bougares F., Schwenk H., Bengio Y., Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation, Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1724-1734, (2014); Prajapati P., Predictive Analysis of Bitcoin Price Considering Social Sentiments, (2020); Wang Y., Chen R., Cryptocurrency price prediction based on multiple market sentiment, Proceedings of the 53rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 1092-1100, (2020); Raju S.M., Tarif A.M., Real-time Prediction of Bitcoin Price Using Machine Learning Techniques and Public Sentiment Analysis, (2020); Pathak S., Kakkar A., Cryptocurrency price prediction based on historical data and social media sentiment analysis, Proceedings of 7th Innovations in Computer Science and Engineering (ICICSE), 97, pp. 177-192, (2020); Cerda G.N.C., Bitcoin Price Prediction Through Stimulus Analysis: On the Footprints of Twitter's Crypto-influencers, (2021); Vo A.-D., Nguyen Q.-P., Ock C.-Y., Sentiment analysis of news for effective cryptocurrency price prediction, International Journal of Knowledge Engineering (IJKE), 5, 2, pp. 47-52, (2019); Gao S., Et al., Short-term runoff prediction with GRU and LSTM networks without requiring time step optimization during sample generation, Journal of Hydrology, 589, (2020); Hamayel M.J., Owda A.Y., A Novel Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Model Using GRU, LSTM and bi-LSTM Machine Learning Algorithms, Ai, 2, 4, pp. 477-496, (2021); Meng S., Jiang X.Q., Gao Y., Hai H., Hou J., Performance Evaluation of Channel Decoder based on Recurrent Neural Network, "" Conference on Communication, Image, and Signal Processing (CCISP), Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1438, 1, (2020); Chin C.K., Omar N., Bitcoin price prediction based on sentiment of news article and market data with LSTM model, Asia-Pacific Journal of Information Technology and Multimedia (APJITM), 9, 1, pp. 1-16, (2020); Lamon C., Nielsen E., Redondo E., Cryptocurrency price prediction using news and social media sentiment, Smu Data Science Review, pp. 1-22, (2017); Chen C.Y.-H., Despres R., Guo L., Renault T., What makes cryptocurrencies special?

Although there are various conceptualizations of the IField, to date, in-depth studies based on empirical evidence are scarce. This article reports a study that fills this gap. We focus on the first five ISchools in the ICaucus as a proxy to represent the IField. The intellectual characteristics are depicted by two independent sets of data on tenure track faculty as knowledge contributors: their intellectual heritages and the intellectual substance in their journal publications. We use a critical analysis method to examine doctoral training areas and 3 years of journal publications. Our results indicate that (a) the IField can be better conceptualized with empirical support by a four-component model that includes People, Information, Technology, and Management, as predicted by the I-Model (Zhang & Benjamin, 2007); (b) the ISchools' faculty members are diverse, interdisciplinary, and multidisciplinary as shown by their intellectual heritages, by their research foci, by journals in which they publish, by the contexts within which they conduct research, and by the levels of analysis in research investigations; (c) the five ISchools share similarities while evincing differences in both faculty heritages and intellectual substances; (d) ISchool tenure track faculty members do not collaborate much with each other within or across schools although there is great potential; and (e) intellectual heritages are not good predictors of scholars' intellectual substance. We conclude by discussing the implications of the findings on IField identity, IField development, new ISchool formation and existing ISchool evolution, faculty career development, and collaboration within the IField. © 2013 ASIS&T.","","Employment; Research; Career development; Critical analysis; Education and researches; Faculty members; In-depth study; Independent set; Journal publication; Levels of analysis; Teaching","","","","","","","Babbie E.R., The Practice of Social Research, (2010); Bar-Ilan J., Measuring research impact: A first approximation of the achievements of the iSchools in ISI's Information and Library Science category - An exploratory study, IConference, (2010); Bureau S., schools of Information"": What do they mean by that?, Le Libellio d'Aegis, 2008, pp. 43-55, (2008); Chen C., Thematic maps of 19 ISchools, The American Society for Information Science and Technology, (2008); King J.L., Identity in the I-School movement, Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 33, pp. 13-15, (2006); Larsen R., Reinforcing the ""i"" in IT education, Educause, (2004); Larsen R., I-school for the 21st Century: An Introduction to the School of Information Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh, (2005); Liddy E., Keynotes.

Given that machine translation could fall short in contextually complex tweets, we only limited machine translation to the word level. In this paper, we bridge the language gap between English and Malay through cross-lingual word embeddings constructed using singular value decomposition. We pre-trained our hierarchical attention model using English tweets and fine-tuned it using a set of gold standard Malay tweets. Our model uses significantly less computational resources compared to the language models. Experimental results show that the performance of our model is better than mBERT in zero-shot learning by 2.4% and Malay BERT by 0.8% when a limited number of Malay tweets is available. In exchange for 6 – 7 times less in computational time, our model only lags behind mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by a margin of 0.9 – 4.3 % in few-shot learning. Also, the word-level attention could be transferred to the Malay tweets accurately using the cross-lingual word embeddings. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Machine translation; Singular value decomposition; Zero-shot learning; Attention model; Computational resources; Cross-lingual; Embeddings; Emotion classification; Emotion corpora; Gold standards; Machine translations; Model use; Word level; Embeddings","","","","","Aqilah Syahirah Shahabudin and Nur Alya Mazlan; Siti Sakinah Ahmad Sanusi; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/ICT02/USM/02/3)","This study was funded by ""Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with Project Code: FRGS/1/2020/ICT02/USM/02/3"".

We experimented with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn sentiment polarity (positive or negative) from labeled data available in many different source domains and test its performance on a target domain that it is not trained on. Extensive experiments were conducted on 14 different domains using Amazon product reviews. Our preliminary findings show that cross-domain CNN models trained with multiple source domains achieved accuracy of above 80% across all the domains and outperform the in-domain models trained using limited labeled data from the same domain. In fact, the cross-domain CNN models demonstrated better performance when a larger number of source domains are used for training. Therefore, going deep and big is a promising direction to explore for cross-domain sentiment classification. © 2020 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; cross-domain sentiment classification; deep learning; product reviews; sentiment analysis","Convolution; Labeled data; Sentiment analysis; Different domains; Multiple domains; Multiple source; Number of sources; Product reviews; Sentiment classification; Target domain; Training data; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (203/PKOMP/67711796); Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6315171)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is made possible partially through the research assistantship from Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia (203/PKOMP/67711796).

This paper introduces an alternative approach in applying machine learning to block cipher cryptanalysis. Rather than trying to extract secret keys, machine learning classifiers are trained to predict a cipher's security margin with respect to the number of active s-boxes. Prediction is based on cipher features such as the number of rounds, permutation pattern, and truncated differences. Experiments are performed on a simplified generalised Feistel structure (GFS) block cipher. Prediction accuracy is optimised by refining how cipher features are represented as training data, and tuning hyperparameters. Results show that the machine learning classifiers are able formulate a relationship between the cipher features and security. When used to predict an unseen cipher (a cipher whose data was not used for training), an accuracy of up to 62% was obtained, depicting the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2020 ACM.","Active s-box; Block cipher; Differential cryptanalysis; Linear classifier; Machine learning; Security","Forecasting; Machine learning; Security of data; Turing machines; Block ciphers; Feistel structures; Hyperparameters; Machine learning approaches; Permutation patterns; Prediction accuracy; Security margins; Training data; Cryptography","","","","","Uniten BOLD; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1)","This work is supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), project number FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1 and by the Uniten BOLD research grant under Grant No. 10463494/B/2019117.","Alallayah K., Amin M., AbdElwahed W., Alhamamii A., Applying neural networks for simplified data encryption standard (SDES) cipher system cryptanalysis, The International Arab Journal of Information Technology, pp. 163-169, (2012); Alani M.M., Neuro-cryptanalysis of DES and triple-DES, Neural Information Processing, pp. 637-646, (2012); Albassal A., Wahdan A.-M., Neural network based cryptanalysis of a feistel type block cipher, International Conference on Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, 2004.

In this “active learning” approach, it is equally important to optimize the creation of the initial ML model given less training data so that the model is able to capture most if not all positive examples, and filter out as many negative examples as possible for human annotators to correct. This paper reports our attempt to optimize the initial ML model through feature exploration in a complex content analysis project that uses a multidimensional coding scheme, and contains codes with sparse positive examples. While different codes respond optimally to different combinations of features, we show that it is possible to create an optimal initial ML model using only a single combination of features for codes with at least 100 positive examples in the gold standard corpus. © 2014 Association for Computational Linguistics","","Artificial intelligence; Codes (symbols); Natural language processing systems; Active Learning; Active machine learning; Automatic approaches; Content analysis; Learning approach; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Positive examples; Semi-automatics; Learning systems","","","","","","","Broadwell G.

However, existing automatic emotion detectors are limited to recognize only the basic emotions. I argue that the range of emotions that can be detected in microblogging text is richer than the basic emotions, and restricting automatic emotion detectors to identify only a small set of emotions limits their practicality in real world applications. Many complex emotions are ignored by current automatic emotion detectors because they are not programmed to seek out these “undefined” emotions. The first part of my investigation focuses on discovering the range of emotions people express on Twitter using manual content analysis, and the emotional cues associated with each emotion. I will then use the gold standard data developed from the first part of my investigation to inform the features to be extracted from text for machine learning, and identify the emotions that machine learning models are able to reliably detect from the range of emotions which humans can reliably detect in microblogging text. © 2014 Association for Computational Linguistics","","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; 'current; Basic emotions; Behavioural studies; Complex emotions; Content analysis; Emotion detection; Gold standards; Microblogging; Real-world; Social media; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Alm C.

However, current serious game solutions are designed to be task-based rather than story-based. We present ReWIND, a serious role-playing game (RPG) applying cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to design anxiety-relevant storylines and game mechanics. ReWIND advances state-of-the-art mental health games by seamlessly integrating CBT elements and strategies into the game’s storytelling so players can learn how CBT is applied in anxiety scenarios as they play through the game. Our goal is to examine the effectiveness of ReWIND in improving cognitive emotion regulation and anxiety disorders. Through a randomized controlled trial, 40 participants were recruited, of whom half were randomly assigned to play ReWIND while the others worked on a non-game task. Anxiety and cognitive emotion regulation levels were measured before and after the interventions. Our findings show ReWIND significantly reduces the severity level of anxiety symptoms and trait anxiety levels and increases perceived control of anxiety better than the non-game task. ReWIND also obtained positive ratings for its usability and practicality in real life, helping participants to cope better with anxiety disorders. © 2023, Serious Games Society.

This is commonly assessed by counting the number of active substitution boxes (S-boxes) using search algorithms or mathematical solvers that incur high computational costs. These costs increase exponentially with respect to block cipher size and rounds, quickly becoming inhibitive. Conventional S-box enumeration methods also require niche cryptographic knowledge to perform. In this paper, we overcome these problems by proposing a data-driven approach using deep neural networks to predict the number of active S-boxes. Our approach trades off exactness for real-time efficiency as the bulk of computational work is brought over to pre-processing (training). Active S-box prediction is framed as a regression task whereby neural networks are trained using features such as input and output differences, number of rounds, and permutation pattern. We first investigate the feasibility of the proposed approach by applying it on a reduced (4-branch) generalized Feistel structure (GFS) cipher. Apart from optimizing a neural network architecture for the task, we also explore the impact of each feature and its representation on prediction error. We then extend the idea to 64-bit GFS ciphers by first training neural networks using data from five different ciphers before using them to predict the number of active S-boxes for TWINE, a lightweight block cipher. The best performing model achieved the lowest root mean square error of 1.62 and R2 of 0.87, depicting the feasibility of the proposed approach.  © 2013 IEEE.","Active S-boxes; block cipher; cryptanalysis; deep learning; differential cryptanalysis; lightweight cryptography; neural networks; TWINE","Cryptography; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Lyapunov methods; Mean square error; Network architecture; Neural networks; Security of data; Data-driven approach; Differential cryptanalysis; Generalized feistel; Generalized Feistel structure; Lightweight block ciphers; Permutation patterns; Root mean square errors; Security requirements; Deep learning","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1)","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia through the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Project FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1.","Bansod G., Raval N., Pisharoty N., Implementation of a new lightweight encryption design for embedded security, IEEE Trans.

Most of these machine learning-based approaches are black box attacks that are cipher-specific. Thus, more research is required to understand the capabilities and limitations of machine learning when being used to evaluate block cipher security. We contribute to this body of knowledge by investigating the capability of linear and nonlinear machine learning classifiers in evaluating block cipher security. We frame block cipher security evaluation as a classification problem, whereby the machine learning models attempt to classify a given block cipher output as secure or insecure based on the number of active S-boxes. We also train the machine learning models with common block cipher features such as truncated differences, the number of rounds, and permutation pattern. Various experiments were performed on small-scale (4-branch) generalized Feistel ciphers to identify the best performing machine learning model for the given security evaluation problem. Results show that nonlinear machine learning models outperform linear models, achieving a prediction accuracy of up to 93% when evaluating inputs from ciphers that they have seen before during training. When evaluating inputs from other unseen ciphers, nonlinear models again outperformed linear models with an accuracy of up to 71%. We then showcase the feasibility of our approach when used to evaluate a real-world 16-branch generalized Feistel cipher, TWINE. By training the best performing nonlinear classifiers (k-nearest neighbour and decision tree) using data from other similar ciphers, the nonlinear classifiers achieved a 74% accuracy when evaluating differential data generated from TWINE. In addition, the trained classifiers were capable of generalizing to a larger number of rounds than they were trained for. Our findings showcase the feasibility of using simple machine learning classifiers as a security evaluation tool to assess block cipher security.  © 2013 IEEE.","Active S-boxes; Block cipher; Cryptanalysis; Differential cryptanalysis; Lightweight cryptography; Machine learning; TWINE","Decision trees; Lyapunov methods; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Security of data; Active S-box; Block ciphers; Cryptanalyse; Differential cryptanalysis; Feistel ciphers; Generalized feistel; Light-weight cryptography; Machine learning models; S-boxes; Security evaluation; Cryptography","","","","","","","Chen J., Teh J., Liu Z., Su C., Samsudin A., Xiang Y., Towards accurate statistical analysis of security margins: New searching strategies for differential attacks, Ieee Trans.

The class distribution in a tweet corpus (EmoTweet-28) labelled with 28 emotion categories varies significantly with the largest category (happiness) occurring 11.5% and the smallest category occurring only 0.2%. For each emotion category, there are far more negative examples than positive examples. Unlike conventional wisdom, downsampling the data in our skewed corpus did not improve classifier performance. However, we found that increasing the negative examples in the training data leads to lower recall but higher precision. Demonstrating how the ratio of positive and negative examples in the training data affect the performance of emotion classifiers is the main contribution of this study. © 2021 IEEE.","class imbalance; data analytics; fine-grained emotion classification; machine learning; sentiment analysis; social media","Classifiers; Class distributions; Class imbalance; Classifier performance; Different proportions; Emotion classification; Negative examples; Negative samples; Positive examples; Classification (of information)","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304P/ KOMP6315/ 171)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia Short Term Grant (304P/ KOMP6315/ 171).

The objective of this cross-sectional study is to determine the prevalence of cyberbullying, suicidal behaviour, and their association among adolescents in Peninsular Malaysia. The study was conducted among 1290 secondary school adolescents aged between 13 and 17 years old in Peninsular Malaysia using a self-administered and anonymous online questionnaire. Our findings reveal that the prevalence of cyberbullying victimization and perpetrator is 13.7% and 3.8%, respectively. The prevalence of suicidal behaviour among adolescents is 17.1%, in which 11.9% had suicidal thoughts, 10.2% had a suicide plan, and 8.4% had made a suicide attempt. Multiple logistic regression shows that adolescents experiencing cyberbullying victimization is a significant risk factor (p < 0.001) for suicidal behaviour after adjusting for other confounders. An alarming number of adolescents in Peninsular Malaysia found to be involved in cyberbullying and its significant association with suicidal behaviour warrant the need to strengthen current interventions. Since the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, our findings make an important contribution in reporting current trends in cyberbullying and suicide among adolescents, especially when they are becoming ever-more present in cyberspaces. © 2022 by the authors.

The socially-interactive dressing room allows shoppers to talk to their friends in real time for opinions on their garment purchasing decisions. Our work is motivated by the observation that shoppers who lack fashion sense often rely on their friends' opinions when making garment purchasing decisions. Using the iterative user interface design methodology, we conducted a mini focus group and interviews among male and female shoppers to refine the user interface design. Our findings suggest that an iterative approach proves to be useful in uncovering and addressing usability, aesthetics, and trust issues that arise from incorporating a socially interactive system within a dressing room context.","Formative evaluation; Interactive user interface; Iterative design; Shopping behavior; Social network; Socially-interactive dressing room","Design; Human computer interaction; Social networking (online); User interfaces; Dressing rooms; Formative evaluation; Interactive user interfaces; Iterative design; Iterative evaluation; Purchasing decisions; Shopping behaviour; Social network; Socially-interactive dressing room; User interface designs; Iterative methods","","","","","","","Annett J., Duncan K.D., Task analysis and training design, Occupational Psychology, 41, pp. 211-221, (1967); Koolhaas R., Bertelli P., Hommert J., Kubo M., Prada M., Projects for Prada: Part 1, (2002); Nanda S., Virtual Mirrors, (2007); Nielsen J., Iterative user-interface design, Computer, 26, 11, pp. 32-34, (2002); Retailing Today, (2007); Swedberg C., Magicmirror could assist retail customers, RFID Journal, (2006); Swedberg C., Hong kong shoppers use RFID-enabled mirror to see what they want, RFID Journal, (2007); Flynn L.R., Goldsmith R.E., Eastman J.K., Opinion leaders and opinion seekers: Two new measurement scales, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 24, 2, pp. 137-147, (1996); Te'eni D., Carey J.M., Zhang P., Human Computer Interaction: Developing Effective Organizational Information Systems, (2007); Wong W.K., Zeng X.H., Au W.M.R., Mok P.Y., Leung S.Y.S., A fashion mix-and-match expert system for fashion retailers using fuzzy screening approach, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 2, pp. 1750-1764, (2009); Zhang W., Matsumoto T., Liu J., Chu M., Begole B., An intelligent fitting room using multi-camera perception, Proc. of the 13th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, pp. 60-69, (2008)","J.

Klout, a company that measures influence on the social web, recently ranked Syracuse University (SU) as the No. 2 ""Most Influential College on Twitter"". While at first glance, Klout's ranking presents a flattering portrayal of SU's adept use of social media, we question if the Klout score has real substance, and actually reflects the effectiveness of SU's social media strategy. This paper explores the issue of how one assigns value to a tweet in the context of an academic institution from a survey of SU students on their motivation of Twitter use, behavior, and perception of value associated with a tweet. As users primarily read tweets to obtain interesting information, preliminary findings indicate that users in academic institutions are more concerned with the quality of tweet contents as opposed to how influential the institution is on Twittersphere. © 2012 Authors.","measurement; social media; Tweet; twitter; value","Industry; Measurements; Academic institutions; Appropriate metrics; Interesting information; Social media; Syracuse University; Tweet; twitter; value; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Klout: The Standard for Influence, (2011); Morrow K., Syracuse University Is Second Most Influential College on Twitter, (2011); Hoffman D.L., Fodor M., Can You Measure the ROI of Your Social Media Marketing?, MIT Sloan Management Review, 52, 1, (2010); Avnit A., The Million Followers Fallacy, (2009); Cha M., Haddadi H., Benevenuto F., Gummadi K.P., Measuring User Influence in Twitter: The Million Follower Fallacy, 4th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM), (2010)","J.L.S.

Developed using a combination of image processing and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, CDES possesses the capability to count the number of people in moderately high crowds from a flexibly selected region of interest (ROI). Background removal and edge detection are first applied to the image for crowd feature extraction. Then, the extracted crowd foreground blob pixels are scaled accordingly to correct perspective distortion. Finally, the corrected pixel blobs act as input for the backpropagation (BP) neural network to estimate the number of people within the blob. Using the area of the selected ROI, the crowd density is calculated and classified into five ranges from very low to very high.

This paper focuses on creating an English-Malay cross-lingual word embeddings using embedding alignment by exploiting existing language resources. We augmented the training bilingual lexicons using machine translation with the goal to improve the alignment precision of our cross-lingual word embeddings. We investigated the quality of the current state-of-the-art English-Malay bilingual lexicon and worked on improving its quality using Google Translate. We also examined the effect of Malay word coverage on the quality of cross-lingual word embeddings. Experimental results with a precision up till 28.17% show that the alignment precision of the cross-lingual word embeddings would inevitably degrade after 1-NN but a better seed lexicon and cleaner nearest neighbours can reduce the number of word pairs required to achieve satisfactory performance. As the English and Malay monolingual embeddings are pre-trained on informal language corpora, our proposed English-Malay embeddings alignment approach is also able to map non-standard Malay translations in the English nearest neighbours. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Translation (languages); Bilingual lexicons; Cross-lingual; Down-stream; Embeddings; High quality; Language resources; Malay languages; Malay texts; Nearest-neighbour; Text classification; Embeddings","","","","","","","Aldarmaki Hanan, Diab Mona, Context-Aware Cross-Lingual Mapping, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 1, pp. 3906-3911, (2019); Anastasopoulos Antonios, Neubig Graham, Should All Cross-Lingual Embeddings Speak English?, Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 8658-8679, (2020); Mikel Artetxe, Gorka Labaka, Eneko Agirre, Learning principled bilingual mappings of word embeddings while preserving monolingual invariance, Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 2289-2294, (2016); Mikel Artetxe, Gorka Labaka, Eneko Agirre, A robust self-learning method for fully unsupervised cross-lingual mappings of word embeddings, Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 789-798, (2018); Miceli Barone Antonio Valerio, Towards cross-lingual distributed representations without parallel text trained with adversarial autoencoders, Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, pp. 121-126, (2016); Bird Steven, Klein Ewan, Loper Edward, Natural Language Processing With Python: Analyzing Text With The Natural Language Toolkit, (2009); Conneau Alexis, Khandelwal Kartikay, Goyal Naman, Chaudhary Vishrav, Wenzek Guillaume, Guzman Franciso, Grave Edouard, Ott Myle, Zettlemoyer Luke, Stoyanov Veselin, Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Representation Learning At Scale, Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 8440-8451, (2020); Conneau Alexis, Lample Guillaume, Ranzato Marc' Aurelio, Denoyer Ludovic, Jegou Herve, Word Translation Without Parallel Data, (2018); Devlin Jacob, Chang Ming-Wei, Lee Kenton, Toutanova Kristina, BERT: Pre-Training Of Deep Bidirectional Transformers For Language Understanding, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 1, pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Dinu Georgiana, Lazaridou Angeliki, Baroni Marco, Improving zero-shot learning by mitigating the hubness problem, (2015); Manaal Faruqui, Chris Dyer, Improving Vector Space Word Representations Using Multilingual Correlation, Proceedings of the 14th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 462-471, (2014); Yanlin Feng, Xiaojun Wan, Learning Bilingual Sentiment-Specific Word Embeddings without Cross-lingual Supervision, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 1, pp. 420-429, (2019); Ghasemi Rouzbeh, Asli Ashrafi, Arad Syed, Momtazi Saeedeh, Deep Persian Sentiment Analysis: Cross-Lingual Training For Low-Resource Languages, Journal of Information Science, (2020); Frederic Godin, Improving and Interpreting Neural Networks for Word-Level Prediction Tasks in Natural Language Processing, (2019); Zolkepli Husein, Malaya, Natural-Language-Toolkit library for bahasa Malaysia, powered by Deep Learning Tensorflow [Github], (2018); Ang Lu, Weiran Wang, Mohit Bansal, Kevin Gimpel, Karen Livescu, Deep Multilingual Correlation for Improved Word Embeddings, Proceedings of the 2015 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pp. 250-256, (2015); Tomas Mikolov, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado, Jeffrey Dean, Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space, (2013); Tomas Mikolov, Le Quoc V., Ilya Sutskever, Exploiting Similarities among Languages for Machine Translation, (2013); Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, Christoper Manning, Glove: Global Vectors for Word Representation, Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1532-1543, (2014); Peters Matthew.

The method can be used to expand the range of emotions that automatic classifiers can detect through the identification of fine-grained emotion categories human annotators are capable of detecting in tweets. The in-ter-annotator reliability statistics for 18 annotators using dif-ferent granularity of the emotion classification schemes are compared. An initial set of emotion categories representa-tive of the range of emotions expressed in tweets is derived. Using this method, researchers can make more informed de-cisions regarding the level of granularity and representa-tiveness of emotion labels that automatic emotion classifiers should be able to detect in text.

While distant supervision provides a viable alternative, the self-labeled emotion corpus is susceptible to a high level of noise. This paper introduces a text augmentation method that can be used to efficiently expand the size of positive examples for the purpose of training by harnessing tweets collected from distant supervision (DS) that are similar to a small set of gold standard seed tweets. Tweets labeled with happiness in EmoTweet-28 (ET) are used as gold standard seeds to augment the training data to include similar DS tweets containing the happiness hashtags. Three pre-trained sentence encoders are used to encode the tweets into multidimensional vectors for similarity scoring between each DS:ET-seed pair. DS tweets with similarity scores exceeding a predefined threshold are added into an augmented set that is subsequently used to train a linear SVM classifier to distinguish between happiness and non-happiness. Our proposed text augmentation method proved to be a more effective approach that can leverage quality training data in larger quantities contributed by both carefully curated and distant supervision emotion corpora. © 2020 IEEE.","distant supervision; emotion classification; machine learning; microblog; sentence embeddings; similarity measures; text augmentation","Support vector machines; Text processing; Augmentation methods; Effective approaches; Emotion classification; Machine learning models; Multi-dimensional vectors; Positive examples; Similarity measure; Similarity scores; Classification (of information)","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6315171)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia Short Term Grant (304/PKOMP/6315171).

Using four different sampling strategies (random sampling, sampling by topic and two variations of sampling by user), we found the class distribution of28 emotion categories to differ across the samples produced by each sampling strategy. However, combining different sampling strategies is complementary in generating sufficiently diverse training examples for the emotion classifiers. Based on support vector machine (SVM) and Bayesian network learning algorithms, our findings show that a classifier trained on combined data from the four sampling strategies performs better and is more generalizable than a classifier trained only on data from a single sampling strategy. Demonstrating how the diversity of the training samples affect the performance of emotion classifiers is the main contribution of this study. © 2019 IEEE.","Fine-grained emotion classification; Machine learning; Microblog text; Sample diversity; Sampling strategies","Bayesian networks; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Sampling; Support vector machines; Text processing; Bayesian network learning; Class distributions; Emotion classification; Micro-blog; Random sampling; Sampling strategies; Training example; Training sample; Classification (of information)","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6315171)","This research was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia Short Term Grant (304/PKOMP/6315171).
