More often than not, daily behavior recognition involves detecting the heads or body gestures of the livestock using conventional methods or tools. To prevail over such limitations, an effective approach using deep learning is proposed in this study for cattle behavior recognition. Methods: The approach for detecting the behavior of individual cows was designed in terms of their eating, drinking, active, and inactive behaviors captured from video sequences and based on the investigation of the attributes and practicality of the state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Result: Among the four models employed, Mask R-CNN achieved average recognition accuracies of 93.34%, 88.03%, 93.51% and 93.38% for eating, drinking, active and inactive behaviors. This implied that Mask R-CNN achieved higher cow detection accuracy and speed than the remaining models with 20 fps, making the proposed approach competes favorably well with other approaches and suitable for behavior recognition of group-ranched cattle in real-time. © 2022 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

It plays an important role in healthcare, marketing, and counselling. With the advancement in deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system's accuracy is improving. A hybrid CNN and k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) model can improve FER's accuracy. This paper presents a hybrid CNN-KNN model for FER on the Raspberry Pi 4, where we use CNN for feature extraction. Subsequently, the KNN performs expression recognition. We use the transfer learning technique to build our system with an EfficientNet-Lite model. The hybrid model we propose replaces the Softmax layer in the EfficientNet with the KNN. We train our model using the FER-2013 dataset and compare its performance with different architectures trained on the same dataset. We perform optimization on the Fully Connected layer, loss function, loss optimizer, optimizer learning rate, class weights, and KNN distance function with the k-value. Despite running on the Raspberry Pi hardware with very limited processing power, low memory capacity, and small storage capacity, our proposed model achieves a similar accuracy of 75.26% (with a slight improvement of 0.06%) to the state-of-the-art's Ensemble of 8 CNN model. © 2013 IEEE.","EfficientNet-Lite; emotion recognition; facial expression recognition; hybrid CNN-KNN; Raspberry Pi","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Face recognition; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Transfer learning; Distance functions; Expression recognition; Facial expression recognition; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); Learning techniques; Processing power; State of the art; Storage capacity; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Panksepp J., Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal Emotions, (2004); Izard C., The Psychology of Emotions, (1991); Ekman P., Friesen W., Facial Action Coding System, 1, (1978); Carlson N., Physiology of Behavior, (2012); Yu J., Bhanu B., Evolutionary feature synthesis for facial expression recognition, Pattern Recognit.

The existing emergency routes are designed based on the shortest path to the nearest egress in a vacant layout. This research aims to design an emergency route plan in a realistic closed layout with interior arrangements and crowds as static and dynamic impediments that cause movement divergence and misdirection that affect evacuation time. This research proposes an automated emergency route design using Cellular Automata (CA) based pedestrian simulation in a realistic layout. The simulation was integrated with the Pythagorean Theorem (PT) and Dijkstra's Algorithm (DA) to imitate human exit-finding behaviour during evacuation. The results showed that PT is viable in layouts with static obstacles, requiring 20 % less travel distances and evacuation time than DA with similar experiment sets. However, the DA approach results have become on par with the PT in a layout with dynamic and static obstacles. DA outperforms PT in densely populated regions, while PT outperforms DA in less populated regions. © 2022, DAAAM International Vienna.

However, the production of CFRP composites is prone to fabrication problems, leading to structural defects arising from cycling and aging processes. Identifying these defects at an early stage is crucial to prevent service issues that could result in catastrophic failures. Hence, routine inspection and maintenance are crucial to prevent system collapse. To achieve this objective, conventional nondestructive testing (NDT) methods are utilized to inspect CFRP components. However, the restricted field penetration within the CFRP makes conventional NDT approaches ineffective. Recently, microwave techniques have been developed to address the challenges associated with CFRP inspection by providing better material penetration and more precise results. This paper offers a review of the primary NDT methods employed to inspect CFRP composites, emphasizing microwave-based NDT techniques and their key features. © 2023 by the authors.","composite inspection; fibre-reinforced polymer; microwave NDT; nondestructive testing","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/TK0/USM/02/2)","This work was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with Project Code: FRGS/1/2020/TK0/USM/02/2.","Khalil Y.F., Eco-efficient lightweight carbon-fiber reinforced polymer for environmentally greener commercial aviation industry, Sustain.

To this date, recycling is one of the solutions to manage the waste as it collects and processes recyclable materials into new products instead of throwing the trash to the landfill. However, the consciousness of recycling in our society is still devastatingly lower than expected as people are faced with many challenges that impede them to recycle. One of the challenges is to segregate the waste according to its group. People are still having difficulty to clearly distinguish recyclable materials due to the lack of recycling knowledge. Thus, this paper aims to develop a system that can separate the waste automatically and channel them to the proper bins. To do that, a camera is used to capture the image of the waste. Then, image classification using deep learning model is used to classify different types of wastes. The developed model is then embedded in Raspberry Pi and a servo motor is used to direct the waste to the respective bins for real-world implementation. Experimental results show that the proposed system can identify the categories of waste within the accuracy of 77–85%. This system is expected to deliver the importance of recycling and cultivate recycling practices to the public and finally reduced waste generation on land. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Deep learning; Image recognition; Waste management; Waste sorting","Bins; Deep learning; Land fill; Recycling; Deep learning; Developed model; Environmental problems; Images classification; Learning models; Real-world implementation; Recyclable material; Servo-motor; Waste management systems; Waste sorting; Image recognition","","","","","SAHOMASI; Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Malaysia Perlis","Acknowledgements This project is supported by USM Short Term Grant (PKOMP/6315262), implemented in Smart Home Using MEM Sensors and Ambient Intelligence Lab (SAHOMASI), Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) and part of the collaboration projects between Robotics, Computer Vision, and Image Processing (RCVIP) Research Group of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) and Centre of Excellence for Advanced Sensor Technology (CEASTech), Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP).","Pardini K., Rodrigues J.J.P.C., Diallo O., Das A.K., de Albuquerque V.H.C., Kozlov S.A., A smart waste management solution geared towards citizens, Sensors, 20, 8, pp. 1-15, (2020); Omar M.F., Termizi A.A.A., Zainal D., Wahap N.A., Ismail N.M., Ahmad N., Implementation of spatial smart waste management system in Malaysia, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science 2016, 37, pp. 1-9, (2016); Sin T.J., Chen G.K., Long K.S., Goh I., Hwang H., Current practice of waste management system in Malaysia: Towards sustainable waste management, FPTP Postgraduate Seminar Towards Sustainable Management 2013, 1106, pp. 1-19, (2013); Ahsan A., Alamgir M., El-Sergany M.M., Shams S., Rowshon M.K., Daud N.N.N., Assessment of municipal solid waste management system in a developing country, Chin J Eng, 2014, 56, pp. 1-11, (2014); Sarbassov Y., Sagalova T., Tursunov O., Venetis C., Xenarios S., Inglezakis V., Survey on household solid waste sorting at source in developing economies: A case study of Nur-Sultan City in Kazakhstan, Sustain, 11, 22, pp. 1-17, (2019); Rohan V.V.J., Bhagavat G., Pradip B., Shivam B., Waste segregation using smart robotic arm, Int Res J Eng Technol, 2, 1, pp. 1833-1835, (2017); Malinauskaite J., Jouhara H., Czajczynska D., Stanchev P., Katsou E., Rostkowski P., Thorne R.J., Colon J., Ponsa S., Al-Mansour F., Anguilano L., Krzyzynska R., Lopez I.C., Municipal waste management systems for domestic use, Energy, 141, c, pp. 2013-2044, (2017); Nasee N., Shokar A., Afza G., Mazhr N., Smart solid waste management system, International Conference on Technology and Entrepreneurship in Digital Society, 2019, pp. 1-5, (2019); Sukor A.S.A., Zakaria A., Rahim N.A., Setchi R., Semantic knowledge base in support of activity recognition in smart home environments, Int J Eng Technol, 7, 4, pp. 67-72, (2018); Joseph J., Smart waste management using deep learning with IoT, Int J Netw Syst, 8, 3, pp. 37-40, (2019); Sukor A.S.A., Zakaria A., Rahim N.A., Kamarudin L.M., Nishizaki H., Abnormality detection approach using deep learning models in smart home environments, Proceedings of the 7Th International Conference on Communications and Broadband Networking, pp. 22-27, (2019); Wahab M.N.A., Mohamed A.S.A., Sukor A.S.A., Teng O.C., Text reader for visually impaired person, International Conference on Electronic Design (ICED, 2020, pp. 1-6, (2020); Chu Y., Huang C., Xie X., Tan B., Kamal S., Xiong X., Multilayer hybrid deep-learning method for waste classification and recycling, Comput Intell Neurosci, 2018, pp. 1-9, (2018); Rutqvist D., Kleyko D., Blomstedt F., An automated machine learning approach for smart waste management systems, IEEE Trans Ind Informatics, 16, 1, pp. 384-392, (2020)","M.N.

The recent IoT and edge computing trends bring up the SC technology introduced in the 1960s due to its power efficiency and error resilience properties. In SC, a stochastic number generator (SNG) converts binary numbers into stochastic streams via a weighted binary generator (WBG) and linear feedback shift register (LFSR). Those application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) logic gates might not be optimised for the field-programmable gate array (FPGA), causing FPGA resources underutilisation. In contrast, FPGA friendly multiplexer (MUX) could generate stochastic streams directly from binary input with a specialised finite state machine (FSM). However, it is limited on state tracking when the binary resolution expands, bottlenecking the MUX-based SNG's scalability. This paper proposes a novel function block of Weighed Binary Converter (WBC) to port the traditional LFSR to MUX, eliminating FSM bottlenecking and improving MUX SNG's scalability than WBG SNG in FPGA. The designs are synthesised with Xilinx Vivado HLS targeted at Z7010 FPGA SoC. The result shows that WBC enables 50% resource reduction on 4-bit MUX SNG and 62.5% bus width reduction on 8-bit MUX SNG, speeding up the logic setup time by 15.1% and 7.3%, respectively, compared to the ASIC logic transcoded WBG SNG. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","FPGA; Stochastic computing; Stochastic number generator","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Logic gates; Number theory; Random number generation; Scalability; Shift registers; Stochastic systems; Application-specific integrated circuits; Binary converters; Circuit logic; Finite states machine; Linear feedback shift registers; Number generator; Stochastic computing; Stochastic number generator; Stochastic numbers; Stochastics; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/P-ELECT/8014152)","The author would like to acknowledge the Ministry of Education Malaysia’s financial assistance through Universiti Sains Malaysia RUI grant number 1001/P-ELECT/8014152.","Sim H., Lee J., A new stochastic computing multiplier with application to deep convolutional neural networks, Proceedings-Design Automation Conference, pp. 1-6, (2017); Hojabr R., Givaki K., Tayaranian S.M.R., Et al., SkippyNN: An embedded stochastic-computing accelerator for convolutional neural networks, Proceedings-Design Automation Conference, pp. 1-6, (2019); Chen T.H., Hayes J.P., Design of division circuits for stochastic computing, Proceedings of IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI, ISVLSI, pp. 116-121, (2016); Chu S.I., New divider design for stochastic computing, IEEE Trans.

The time-domain performance of the proposed controller was analyzed using MATLAB/Simulation, and its performance was compared with that of water cycle algorithm, genetic algorithm, and local unimodal sampling algorithm-based PID controllers. The robustness of the proposed controller was verified by applying the disturbances to the generator field voltage and the amplifier parameter uncertainty. The studies presented in literature were discussed the AVR loop stability using the Bode plot which will not give the minimum stability margins. This study proposes a novel stability analysis called disk-based stability analysis to authenticate the stability of the AVR loop which is obtained by the classical analysis. This stability was compared with the proposed stability analysis. The MATLAB results reveal that the SDO-PID controller regulates the terminal voltage of the generator precisely, is more robust to parameter uncertainty, and is more stable than the other controllers. The maximum allowable parameter uncertainty of the amplifier model was identified as 102% of its nominal parameters. The stability margins are recognized as DGM = 10.40 dB and DPM = 56.50° for the AVR stability.  © 2023 Pasala Gopi et al.","","Controllers; Genetic algorithms; Proportional control systems; Simulink;

Auto speech recognition (ASR), speech-to-text, and computer speech recognition are all terms used to describe speech recognition. A single user's voice it is necessary to distinguish between speech recognition and voice recognition. The first is to translate speech into text, such as, the audible voice and concept (human speech), and the second is to define only sound, such as, animal sound, car, etc. There is no algorithm that is specifically designed for this field; instead, techniques such as N-grams and neural networks are used to explain and treat this type. Natural Language Processing (NLP), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Speaker Diarization (SD). The last type would be addressed in my work. Natural language processing is a computational technique that can be used and applied to various levels of linguistic analysis (dare, deep analysis) to represent natural language in a useful or more representation. It is still possible to improve current recognition and identification systems in order to achieve greater accuracy. A new approach has been proposed that distinguishes speech in four stages: speech recognition, tokenization, extracting features of speech from texts, and part speech: The three patterns of Name Entity Recognition (NER), followed by the possibility of implementing the proposed model It achieved more accurate and applied results in an educational environment by using a NAO-robot.  © 2021 IEEE.","Model; NAO-robot; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Speech Recognition","Character recognition; Hidden Markov models; Human robot interaction; Linguistics; Speech; Speech recognition; Auto speech recognition; Computer speech recognition; Human speech; Humans-robot interactions; N-grams; NAO-robot; Natural language processing; Preliminary model; Recognition models; Single users; Natural language processing systems","","","","","School of Computer Sciences at Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia","This project is supported by the RUI grant (1001 / PMEDIA / 8016096), Universiti Sains Malaysia.

The use of bad quality irrigation water can cause soil problems. In general, determining water quality model is one of the many interests as it can be used to classify the conditions of water. This project focuses on developing the in-situ sensing system of water quality sensors that can detect parameters of water quality such as pH level, electric conductivity, temperature and total dissolved solid. To validate the approach, there are three types of water samples in a dataset that was collected which include water pipes, soap water and drain water. The types of machine learning models used for classification process are Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree. The performance showed that SVM model was the highest, ANN was intermediate, and Decision Tree was the lowest. This shows that the SVM model of machine learning approach is the most suitable to be used as the classification model to classify the status of water quality.  © 2022 IEEE.","artificial neural network; decision tree; sensors; support vector machine; water quality","Irrigation; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Water pipelines; Water quality; Agriculture sectors; Bad quality; Condition; Irrigation waters; Machine learning approaches; Quality of water; Sensing systems; Support vector machine models; Support vectors machine; Water quality modelling; Decision trees","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/STG06/USM/02/4)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme under Project FRGS/1/2020/STG06/USM/02/4.","Kaletova T., Jurik L., Quality of Water Required for Irrigation, Springer Int.

Wearable sensors have become more ubiquitous, and most of the wearable sensor data contain rich temporal structural information that describes the distinct underlying patterns and relationships of various activity types. The nature of those activities is typically sequential, with each subsequent activity window being the result of the preceding activity window. However, the state-of-the-art methods usually model the temporal characteristic of the sensor data and ignore the relationship of the sliding window. This research proposes a novel deep temporal Conv-LSTM architecture to enhance activity recognition performance by utilizing both temporal characteristics from sensor data and the relationship of sliding windows. The proposed architecture is evaluated based on the dataset consisting of transition activities—Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions dataset. The proposed hybrid architecture with parallel features learning pipelines has demonstrated the ability to model the temporal relationship of the activity windows where the transition of activities is captured accurately. Besides that, the size of sliding windows is studied, and it has shown that the selection of window size is affecting the accuracy of the activity recognition. The proposed deep temporal Conv-LSTM architecture can achieve an accuracy score of 0.916, which outperformed the state-of-the-art accuracy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Activity recognition; Deep learning; LSTM; Temporal model","Decoding; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Pattern recognition; Wearable sensors; Activity recognition; Deep learning; Human activity recognition; LSTM; Research communities; Sensor technologies; Sensors data; Sliding Window; Temporal characteristics; Temporal models; Smartphones","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/USM/02/1)","This work has been supported in part by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with Project Code: FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/USM/02/1.

The presence of delamination in the composite insulations may cause turbine failure, leading to a catastrophic accident. Thus, regular non-destructive testing is required to detect and evaluate insulation defects. Among the non-destructive testing techniques, the microwave technique has emerged as a promising method for assessing defects in ceramic coatings. Although the method is promising, microwave non-destructive testing suffers from poor spatial imaging, making the defect assessment challenging. In this paper, a novel technique based on microwave non-destructive testing with a k-medoids clustering algorithm for delamination detection is proposed. The representative ceramic coating sample is scanned using a Q-band open-ended rectangular waveguide with 101 frequency points that operated between 33 to 50 GHz. The measured data is transformed from the frequency domain to the time domain using an inverse fast Fourier transform. The principal component analysis is then used to reduce the dimensionality of 101 time steps into only 3 dominant attributes. The attributes of each inspected location are classified as defect or defect-free using the k-medoids clustering algorithm for accurately detecting and sizing the defects in the ceramic insulation. The results reported in this paper highlight the superiority of the k-medoids clustering algorithm in delamination detection, with an accuracy rate of 95.4%. This is a significant step forward compared to earlier approaches for identifying ceramic defects. © 2022 by the authors.","ceramic insulation; clustering algorithm; defects under insulation; delamination; microwave non-destructive testing","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/STG06/USM/02/4)","This research was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme Project FRGS/1/2020/STG06/USM/02/4.","Zhao Z., Review of Non-Destructive Testing Methods for Defect Detection of Ceramics, Ceram.

Campus, Nibong Tebal, 14300, Malaysia","Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) have recently established themselves as an extremely interesting area of research thanks to the mysterious qualities of the ocean. The UWSN consists of sensor nodes and vehicles working to collect data and complete tasks. The battery capacity of sensor nodes is quite limited, which means that the UWSN network needs to be as efficient as it can possibly be. It is difficult to connect with or update a communication that is taking place underwater due to the high latency in propagation, the dynamic nature of the network, and the likelihood of introducing errors. This makes it difficult to communicate with or update a communication. Cluster-based underwater wireless sensor networks (CB-UWSNs) are proposed in this article. These networks would be deployed via Superframe and Telnet applications. In addition, routing protocols, such as Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Fisheye State Routing (FSR), Location-Aided Routing 1 (LAR1), Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR), and Source Tree Adaptive Routing—Least Overhead Routing Approach (STAR-LORA), were evaluated based on the criteria of their energy consumption in a range of various modes of operation with QualNet Simulator using Telnet and Superframe applications. STAR-LORA surpasses the AODV, LAR1, OLSR, and FSR routing protocols in the evaluation report’s simulations, with a Receive Energy of 0.1 mWh in a Telnet deployment and 0.021 mWh in a Superframe deployment. The Telnet and Superframe deployments consume 0.05 mWh transmit power, but the Superframe deployment only needs 0.009 mWh. As a result, the simulation results show that the STAR-LORA routing protocol outperforms the alternatives. © 2023 by the authors.","CB-UWSN; energy; routing protocols; superframe; telnet; UWSN","Energy utilization; Internet protocols; Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Stars; Cluster-based; Cluster-based underwater wireless sensor network; Energy; Routing approach; Routing-protocol; Source tree adaptive routing; Super frame; Telnet; Underwater wireless sensor networks; Routing protocols","","","","","","","Srinivasulu A., Anand Kumar G., Performance Analysis of Underwater Wireless Sensor Network by Deploying FTP, CBR, and VBR as Applications, J.

Many ALPR research proposed new CNN model designs and post-processing methods with various levels of performances in ALPR. However, good performing models such as YOLOv3 and SSD in more general object detection and recognition tasks could be effectively transferred to the license plate detection application with a small effort in model tuning. This paper focuses on the design of experiment (DOE) of training parameters in transferring YOLOv3 model design and optimising the training specifically for license plate detection tasks. The parameters are categorised to reduce the DOE run requirements while gaining insights on the YOLOv3 parameter interactions other than seeking optimised train settings. The result shows that the DOE effectively improve the YOLOv3 model to fit the vehicle license plate detection task.  © 2013 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network; design of experiments; license plate detection","Convolution; Feature extraction; Job analysis; License plates (automobile); Neural networks; Object detection; Object recognition; Optical character recognition; Processing; Automatic license plate recognition; Classification algorithm; Convolutional neural network; Detection tasks; Features extraction; License; License plate detection; Modeling designs; Task analysis; Design of experiments","","","","","","","Redmon J., Farhadi A., YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement, (2018); Liu W., Anguelov D., Erhan D., Szegedy C., Reed S., Fu C.-Y., Berg A.C., SSD: Single shot multibox detector, Proc.

This paper introduces the Dingo Optimisation Influenced-Arithmetic Clustering and Localisation Algorithm. The proposed method was developed due to the above considerations. DOIAO-CLA combines Dingo Optimisation (DO) and Arithmetic Optimisation (AO), two powerful optimisation methods. DOIAO-CLA uses DO's robust exploration and exploitation features to group sensor nodes with similar propagation characteristics. It also optimises cluster formation and reduces distance discrepancies using AO. DOIAO-CLA also enables reliable localization by merging distance- and angle-based methods. DO optimises node localization by using distance and angle of arrival data. This integration enhances UASN node localization accuracy and reliability. The DOIAO-CLA was tested against other clustering and localization algorithms like Archimedes Optimisation Algorithm (AOA), Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA), Hybrid Cat Cheetah Optimisation Algorithm (HCCOA), Ant Colony Optimisation Algorithm (ACOA), Grey Wolf Optimisation Algorithm (GWOA), and Particle Swarm Optimisation Algorithm. According to the results, DOIAO-CLA taps alternatives for network robustness, data aggregation, and localization precision. Finally, DOIAO-CLA solves the UASN clustering and localization problem in a novel and effective way. © 2023 The Authors","Cluster head selection; DOIAO-CLA scheme; Optimization; Residual Energy; RSS; TDoA; UASNs","Acoustic devices; Ant colony optimization; Clustering algorithms; Sensor nodes; Time difference of arrival; Underwater acoustics; Cluster-head selections; Clusterings; DOIAO-CLA scheme; Localization algorithm; Nodes localization; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Residual energy; TDoA; Underwater acoustic sensor networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/STG06/USM/02/4)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Project FRGS/1/2020/STG06/USM/02/4.","CV R., Ab Wahab M.N., Anbazhagan R., Pau G., Akbar M.F., Underwater wireless sensor networks performance comparison utilizing telnet and superframe, Sensors, 23, (2023); Krishnaswamy V., Manvi S.S., Trusted node selection in clusters for underwater wireless acoustic sensor networks using fuzzy logic, Phys.
