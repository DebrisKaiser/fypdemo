It provides an opportunity to harness a lot of idle peer-resources such as desktop computers across the Internet, for solving large-scale computing applications. Each peer is autonomous and it needs incentive for sustained contribution of its resources to P2P applications. In addition, a flexible and efficient job scheduling is needed to harvest the idle computing power as cheaply and economically as possible. This paper introduces an economic based job scheduler for mapping jobs to resources in P2P computing environment. The scheduler has been implemented with the Compute Power Market (CPM) system developed using Sun JXTA P2P technology. Our scheduler can be configured depending on users' quality of service requirements such as the deadline and budget constraints. Our scheduler follows a hierarchy scheme. The design allows multiple consumers and multiple providers to schedule and run jobs. To allow wider support for a wide variety of applications, the system is designed to allow easy 'plug in' of user applications. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.","","Budget control; Commerce; Distributed computer systems; Personal computers; Quality of service; Scheduling; Social networking (online); Budget constraint; Computing power; Large-scale computing; P2P applications; P2P technologies; Peer-to-peer computing; Peer-to-peer computing systems; Web based computing; Peer to peer networks","","","","","","","Shikey C., What is P2P⋯ And What Isn't, (2000); Subramani V., Kettimuthu Srividya R., Sadayappan S.P., Distributed Job Scheduling on Computational Grids using Multiple Simultaneous Requests, Proceedings of the 11th IEEE International Symposium on High Performance.

The flooding approach causes network overheads and delays due to continuous message broadcasting in the absence of a routing mechanism. Among the routing protocols, AODV is one of the most popular and robust routing protocol for wireless ad hoc networks. In this paper, we optimized the AODV protocol for Bluetooth Low-Energy communication to make it more efficient in comparison to the mesh protocol. With the proposed protocol (Optimized AODV (O-AODV)), we were able to achieve lower overheads, end-to-end delay, and average per-hop one-way delay in comparison to the BLE mesh (flooding) protocol and AODV protocol for all three scenarios (linear topology with ten nodes, multipath topology with six and ten nodes). In addition, the proposed protocol exhibited practically constant route requests and route reply setup times. Furthermore, the proposed protocol demonstrated a better Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) for O-AODV (84%) in comparison to AODV (71%), but lower than the PDR of the mesh (flooding) protocol with 93%. © 2021 by the authors.

For WAHN, there are many available technologies such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, Threads, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) etc. Despite of the improvements in IoT technologies, multicasting pure mesh-based routing is still a major problem that needs to be resolved. In view of the aforesaid, this research will propose a multicast mesh-based communication network architecture and protocol having topology autoconfiguration features. Subsequently, for this study, the use case will be the hospital (being the most critical place dealing with emergencies). Furthermore, for the aforesaid use case, the BLE is supposed to be the most suitable technology being low power and easily available (in smart phone and gadgets). Initially, the BLE was introduced in Bluetooth version 4.0 and its features got matured in the advance version 4.2 and 5. BLE 5 has the capability for mesh topology that has increased the network coverage and enhanced end to end diversity of the Bluetooth based ad-hoc networks. Likewise, in this paper, the emphasis will be on proposing a pure mesh-based routing protocol capable of multicasting and topology autoconfiguration for BLE 5 enabled network for the hospital. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Ad-hoc network; BLE 5; Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Hospital; Mesh network","Ad hoc networks; Bluetooth; Hospitals; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Multicasting; Network architecture; Smartphones; Topology; Auto-configuration; BLE 5; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Bluetooth-based; Internet of thing (IOT); Mesh topologies; Network coverage; Low power electronics","","","","","","","Balogh A., Et al., Service mediation in multi-hop Bluetooth low energy networks based on NDN approach, Proceedings of the Twenty Third International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks, Croatia, pp. 285-289, (2015); Bluetooth Sig, Bluetooth Low Energy; Cabra J., Et al., An IoT approach for wireless sensor networks applied to e-health environmental monitoring, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things (Ithings), pp. 578-583, (2017); Celia G.H., Et al., IoT heterogeneous mesh network deployment for human-in-the-loop challenges towards a social and sustainable industry 4.0, IEEE Access J, 6, pp. 28417-28437, (2018); Chen D., Et al., S2M: A lightweight acoustic fingerprints based wireless device authentication protocol, IEEE Iot J, 4, 1, pp. 88-100, (2017); Chuang Y.H., Et al., A lightweight continuous authentication protocol for the Internet of Things, Sens.

However, this system causes some user pains and problems, i.e. high capital investment, setup and maintenance hassle, lack of flexibility and reliability, and data security and privacy concern. Cloud computing as an emerging technology is used for developing a cloud-based POS software named RetailNow. A cloud service provider is in charge of delivering and maintenances of the software to retailers based on their environments. The provider is also responsible for security and privacy of data on its servers. Due to the pay-per-use subscription model of the cloud, retailers also save in their finance. The retailers only require a basic computer and an internet connection in order to connect to RetailNow. RetailNow is targeted for all scales and environments of retail outlets. The purpose of the study is to understand the influential factors that impact on intention to use RetailNow among retailers in Malaysia. The proposed model is the combination of the TOE and the TAM to obtain applicability and predictive power. In order to test the proposed model, a quantitative study using a self-administrated survey will be directed. A research method which is based on the multi-analytical approach of Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is applied which enables extra verification of the results provided by the PLS-SEM for direct relationships in the model. We only apply PLS-SEM for testing the mediation effect. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","ANN; Cloud-based POS; PLS-SEM; RetailNow; SaaS; TAM; The Point of Sale (POS) system; TOE","Data privacy; Investments; Least squares approximations; Neural networks; Soft computing; Cloud service providers; Cloud-based; Data security and privacy; Partial least square (PLS); Point of sale; RetailNow; SaaS; Structural equation modeling; Sales","","","","","","","Blokdijk G., Point of sale—simple Steps to Win, Insights and Opportunities for Maxing out Success, (2015); Margaret Weber M., Prasad Kantamneni S., POS and EDI in retailing: An examination of underlying benefits and barriers, Supply Chain Manag, 7, 5, pp. 311-317, (2002); Tolbert F., Why point of sales data matters for demand management, J.

Structured retrieval makes use of both content and structure of documents to improve information retrieval. Therefore, the availability of semantic structure in the documents is an important factor for the success of structured retrieval. However, the majority of documents in the Web still lack semantically-rich structure. This motivates us to automatically identify the semantic information in web documents and explicitly annotate the information with semantic tags. Based on the well-known Wikipedia corpus, this paper describes an unsupervised learning approach to identify conceptual information and descriptive information of an entity described in a Wikipedia article. Our approach utilizes Wikipedia link structure and Infobox information in order to learn the semantic structure of the Wikipedia articles. We also describe a lazy approach used in the learning process. By utilizing the Wikipedia categories provided by the contributors, only a subset of entities in a Wikipedia category is used as training data in the learning process and the results can be applied to the rest of the entities in the category.

Moreover, the technologists are doing research to make WMN more reliable and secure. Subsequently, among wireless ad-hoc networking technologies, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is gaining high degree of importance among researchers due to its easy availability in the gadgets and low power consumption. BLE started its journey from version 4.0 and announced the latest version 5 with mesh support capability. BLE being a low power and mesh supported technology is nowadays among the hot research topics for the researchers. Many of the researchers are working on BLE mesh technology to make it more efficient and smart. Apart from other variables of efficiency, like all communication networks, mesh network security is also of a great concern. In view of the aforesaid, this paper provides a comprehensive review on several works associated to the security in WMN and BLE mesh networks and the research related to the BLE security protocols. Moreover, after the detailed research on related works, this paper has discussed the pros and cons of the present developed mesh security mechanisms. Also, at the end after extracting the curx from the present research on WMN and BLE mesh security, this research study has devised some solutions as how to mitigate the BLE mesh network security lapses. © 2019 IEEE.","BLE; Bluetooth Low Energy; Mesh Network; Security; Wireless","Ad hoc networks; Bluetooth; Low power electronics; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Radio; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Hot research topics; Low-power consumption; Security; Security mechanism; Security protocols; Wireless ad-hoc networking; Network security","","","","","","","Glass S., Portmann M., Muthukkumarasamy V., Securing wireless mesh networking, IEEE Internet Computing., 12, 4, pp. 30-36, (2008); Sgora A., Vergados D.D., Chatzimisios P., A survey on security and privacy issues in Wireless Mesh Networks, Security and Communication Networks., 9, pp. 1877-1889, (2013); Bansal D., Sofat S., Pathak P., Bhoot S., Detecting MAC misbehavior switching attacks in Wireless Mesh Networks, International Journal of Computer Applications, 26, 5, pp. 55-62, (2011); Zhou J., Chen Z., Jiang W., Probability based IDS towards secure WMN, 2nd International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications, pp. 1-5, (2010); Yang Y., Zeng P., Yang X., Huang Y., Efficient intrusion detection system model in Wireless Mesh Networks; Network Security Wireless, 2nd International Conference on Communications and Trusted Computing, pp. 393-395, (2010); Fabian H.S., Paul H., David R., Nicholas J.P., OpenLIDS: A lightweight intrusion detection system for wireless mesh networks, 15th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, pp. 309-320, (2009); Rodas O., To M.A., Alvarez J., Maag S., Protecting Wireless Mesh Networks through a distributed intrusion prevention framework, 7th IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications, pp. 1-6, (2015); Boudguiga A., Laurent M., An authentication scheme for IEEE 802.11s mesh networks relying on Sakai-Kasahara ID-Based Cryptographic algorithms, 3rd International Conference on Communications and Networking, pp. 1-8, (2012); Yi D., Xu G., Minqing Z., The research on certificateless hierarchical key management in Wireless Mesh Network, 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks, pp. 504-507, (2011); Jiacheng H., Ning L., Ping Y., Futai Z., Qiang Z., Securing wireless mesh network with mobile firewall, International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing, pp. 1-6, (2010); Adomnicai A., Fournier J.J.A., Masson A., Hardware security threats against bluetooth mesh networks, IEEE International Workshop on Attacks and Defenses for Internet of Things, pp. 1-9, (2018); Pammi A.A., Threats Countermeasures and Research Trends for BLEbased IoT Devices, (2017); O'Connor T., Reeves D., Bluetooth network-based misuse detection, Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, pp. 377-391, (2008); Yu X., Wang Y., Secure constructing bluetooth scatter net based on BTCP, 5th International Conference on Information Assurance and Security, pp. 200-203, (2009); Sadeghzadeh S.H., Shirazani S.J.R., Mosleh M., A new secure scheme purposed for recognition and authentication protocol in Bluetooth environment, 12th ICACT, pp. 1326-1331, (2010); Xu G., Yu B., Security enhanced design of the bluetooth simple pairing protocol, International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology, pp. 292-296, (2011); Fan C., Shieh S., Li B., On the security of password-based pairing protocol in Bluetooth, 13th Asia-Pacific Bluetooth Operations and Management Symposium, pp. 1-4, (2011); Priyanka S.S., Nagajayanthi B., Enhancing security in bluetooth networks, International Conference on Science Engineering and Management Research, pp. 1-3, (2014); Diallo A.S., Wajdi A., Olanrewaju R.F., Sado F., A secure authentication scheme for bluetooth connection, 5th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering, pp. 60-63, (2014); Lonzetta A.M., Cope P., Campbell J., Mohd B.J., Security vulnerabilities in bluetooth technology as used in IoT, Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks, 7, 28, pp. 1-26, (2018); Adeniji V.O., Sibanda K., Analysis of the effect of Malicious Packet drop attack on Packet transmission in Wireless Mesh Networks, 2018 Conference on Information Communications Technology and Society, pp. 1-6, (2018); Darroudi S.M., Gomez C., Bluetooth low energy mesh networks: A survey, Sensors, 17, 7, pp. 1-19, (2017); Ghori M.R., Ghani A., Review of access control mechanisms in cloud computing, Journal of Physic.: Conf.

But they are missing the ingredients to being proactively engaged in the area of identifying blackhats' state of affairs like recording their activities, as and when they try to break in, how they break in, tools or tactics used as of when they are successful or what are their motives when they succeed and so forth. Honeynet gives us the possibilities to obtain early warnings of what may come along the way that could eventually become real threats to our valuable network resources and their continuity of operations. This paper focuses on using multiple layers of Data Control and Data Capture mechanisms in making Honeynet a great architecture to achieve this objective. We implement multiple Data Control mechanisms to contain and control intruders and let them know only what we want them to know. And at the same time, we capture the intruders' activities without them knowing it using multiple Data Capture mechanisms.","Honeynet; Honeypot; Honeywall; Virtual honeynet; Virtualization","Computer architecture; Intrusion detection; Resource allocation; Data capture mechanisms; Honeynet; Honeypot; Honeywall; Virtual honeynet; Computer system firewalls","","","","","","","Know Your Enemy: Learning About Security Threats, (2004); Grimes R.A., Honeypots for Windows, (2005); Baumann R., Honeyd - A low involvement Honeypot in Action, (2003); Clark M., Virtual Honeynets, (2001); Levine J.G., Grizzard J.B., Owen H.L., Using Honeynets to Protect Large Enterprise Networks, IEEE Security and Privacy, 2, 6, pp. 73-75, (2004); Gonzalez Gomez D., (2004); Oudot L., Wireless Honeypot Trickery, SecurityFocus, (2004); Niels Provos A., Virtual Honeypot Framework, 13th USENIX Security Symosium, (2004); Seifried K., Honeypotting with VMWare, (2002); Sim, Steven Kok Leong, The Honeynet Project-Scan of the Month Challenge, 30, (2004)","O.C.

However; there is plenty of idle computational power not being used efficiently since most of this power resides on individual machines, only waiting to be harnessed in an orderly manner. Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology provides the infrastructure and methodology of using this idle power which is otherwise not fully utilized. Compute Power Market (CPM) has been proposed to bring together the providers and users of computing power in a systematic manner.

Most BLE-based mesh protocols are implemented as overlays on top of the standard Bluetooth star topologies while using piconets and scatternets. Nonetheless, mesh topology support has increased the vulnerability of BLE to security threats, since a larger number of devices can participate in a BLE Mesh network. To address these concerns, BLE version 5 enhanced existing BLE security features to deal with various authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality issues. However, there is still a lack of detailed studies related to these new security features. This survey examines the most recent BLE-based mesh network protocols and related security issues. In the first part, the latest BLE-based mesh communication protocols are discussed. The analysis shows that the implementation of BLE pure mesh protocols remains an open research issue. Moreover, there is a lack of auto-configuration mechanisms in order to support bootstrapping of BLE pure mesh networks. In the second part, recent BLE-related security issues and vulnerabilities are highlighted. Strong Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for detecting security breaches in order to protect against zero-day exploits. Nonetheless, viable IDS solutions for BLE Mesh networks remain a nascent research area. Consequently, a comparative survey of IDS approaches for related low-power wireless protocols was used to map out potential approaches for enhancing IDS solutions for BLE Mesh networks. © 2020 by the authors.","BLE; Bluetooth low energy; IoT security; Wireless mesh networks","Bluetooth; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Low power electronics; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Security systems; Surveys; Topology; Auto-configuration; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Internet of Things (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; Low power wireless; Reliable communication; Security protocols; bootstrapping; communication protocol; confidentiality; internet of things; review; Network security","","","","","","","Ghori M.R., Wan T.C., Sodhy G.C., Bluetooth Low Energy 5 Mesh Based Hospital Communication Network (B5MBHCN), Advances in Cyber Security, 1132, pp. 247-261, (2020); Darroudi S.M., Gomez C., Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh Networks: A Survey, Sensors, 17, (2017); Gohel S., Bluetooth Attendance System with Android Application for ERP, Proceedings of the International Conference on Computing, Power and Communication Technologies (GUCON), pp. 481-484, (2018); Sthapit P., Gang H., Pyun J., Bluetooth Based Indoor Positioning Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics-Asia (ICCE-Asia), pp. 206-212; Yumantoro G., Kristalina P., Sudarsono A., Performance Evaluation of Indoor Characteristic based on Bluetooth Low Energy Communication System through Statistical Approach, Proceedings of the International Electronics Symposium on Engineering Technology and Applications (IES-ETA), pp. 189-195; Handojo A., Lim R., Octavia T., Anggita K., Museum Interactive Information Broadcasting Using Indoor Positioning System and Bluetooth Low Energy: A Pilot Project on Trowulan Museum Indonesia, Proceedings of the 3rd Technology Innovation Management and Engineering Science International Conference (TIMES-iCON), pp. 1-5; Sunardy A., Surantha N., Performance Evaluation of Indoor Positioning Algorithm using Bluetooth Low Energy, Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation (ICITSI), pp. 503-507; Mohsin N., Payandeh S., Ho D., Gelinas J.P., Bluetooth Low Energy Based Activity Tracking of Patient, Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV), pp. 1991-1996; Giovanelli D., Farella E., Fontanelli D., Macii D., Bluetooth-Based Indoor Positioning Through ToF and RSSI Data Fusion, Proceedings of the International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), pp. 1-8; Jung C., Kim K., Seo J., Silva B., Han K., Topology Configuration and Multihop Routing Protocol for Bluetooth Low Energy Networks, IEEE Access, 5, pp. 9587-9598, (2017); Leonardi L., Patti G., Lo Bello L., Multi-Hop Real-Time Communications Over Bluetooth Low Energy Industrial Wireless Mesh Networks, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 26505-26519, (2018); Bluetooth Vulnerabilities; Townsend K., Cufi C., Akiba.; Davidson.

This paper proposed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to effectively detect APT activities in each stage of the APT life cycle using decision trees and gradient-boosting algorithms. In addition, this model generates APT fingerprints by optimizing APT stages or attack paths that help the model with early APT detection. This model is evaluated and validated using Dataset APT (DAPT) 2020. The proposed model proved that effectively classified APT activities with more than 97.63 accuracy in most APT stages.

The NDN, and previously content-centric networking (CCN), has been considered as the enabler to address various Internet of Things (IoT) challenges, with the potential to outperform the current IP paradigm in many dimensions. The requirements and challenges of the IoT, imposed by constraints, such as limited memory and computational power, while requiring high energy efficiency in the face of unstable network connectivity, impose extra burdens on the IP paradigm. The named content, in-network caching and named-based routing approach in the CCN and NDN provide promising solutions to overcome these constraints and showcase alternative implementations. This paper aims to investigate and demonstrate the current incorporation of the NDN/CCN with the IoT in terms of in-network caching management, naming scheme for devices and data, access control and policies, forwarding strategies, device configuration, and discovery. © 2013 IEEE.","CCN; content-centric networking; ICN; information-centric networking; Internet of Things; named data networking; NDN","Access control; Energy efficiency; Information management; Internet of things; Content-centric networkings; Device configurations; Forwarding strategies; Future internet architecture; High energy efficiency; Information-centric networkings; Internet of Things (IOT); Named data networkings; Internet protocols","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; University of Southern Maine, USM, (1001/PKOMP/811336)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the USM RUI Grant No. 1001/PKOMP/811336.; Funding text 2: A different communication approach, independent of the IP-based communication model, called Named Data Networking (NDN) [3], [4] has emerged recently which goes beyond end-to-end connections. NDN originated from an earlier project, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) [5], which Van Jacobson proposed at Xerox PARC. This information-based model retrieves content by name without directly mapping the content to host locations, and at the same time achieves better performance, scalability, and security. Both NDN and CCN are considered as Information-Centric Networking (ICN) [6]–[8] instances, similar to previous ICN oriented projects such as DONA [9], COMET [10], and PSIRP [11]. They natively support multicasting, mobility, and in-network caching. In contrast to the host-centric IP-based networking approach, content in CCN/NDN is an integral part of the network. According to Van Jacobson [5], every CCN node specifies what to search for but not where the information is located, unlike the IP-based paradigm. Any authorized consumer can acquire the data using a unique name (self-identifying), and the data can be authenticated with a signature (self-authenticating).

The diversity of structures has led to the emergence of heterogeneous structured documents. The heterogeneity of structured documents is one of the reason for query-document mismatch in structured document retrieval. In structured document retrieval, a user is assumed to have intimate knowledge of the document structures and is able to specify contextual constraints in their queries. However, it is impossible for the user to know all structures in heterogeneous structured document collections. In this paper, we propose to include similar correspondence relations in the representation model for structured document retrieval. The similar correspondences make the relations between similar contents explicit in order to improve structured document retrieval effectiveness. We introduce a generic and flexible structured document model to represent heterogeneous structured documents as well as the similar correspondences in the document collections. We also illustrate how the proposed model can be utilized in structured document retrieval. © 2011 IEEE.","","Semantic Web; Semantics; Stairs; User interfaces; Contextual constraints; Document collection; Document structure; Representation model; Semantic correspondence; Structured document; Structured document retrieval; Information retrieval","","","","","","","Barbosa D., Mignet L., Veltri P., Studying the xml web: Gathering statistics from an xml sample, World Wide Web, 9, 2, pp. 187-212, (2006); Denoyer L., Gallinari P., The wikipedia xml corpus, SIGIR Forum, 40, 1, pp. 64-69, (2006); Gabriella K., Antoine D., Monica L., Overview of the inex 2008 book track, Advances in Focused Retrieval 7th International Workshop of the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval, INEX, pp. 106-123, (2008); Schenkel R., Suchanek F., Kasneci G., Yawn: A semantically annotated wikipedia xml corpus, Proceedings of Datenbanksysteme in Business, Technologie und Web, BTW, pp. 277-291, (2008); Van Zwol R., Van Loosbroek T., Effective use of semantic structure in xml retrieval, Proceedings of the 29th European Conference on IR Research, ECIR, pp. 621-628, (2007); Schlieder T., Meuss H., Querying and ranking xml documents, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, JASIST, 53, 6, pp. 489-503, (2002); Trotman A., Searching structured documents, Information Processing and Management, 40, 4, pp. 619-632, (2004); Trotman A., Sigurbjrnsson B., Narrowed extended xpath i (nexi), Advances in XML Information Retrieval and Evaluation: 3rd International Workshop of the Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval, INEX, pp. 16-40, (2004); Carmel D., Maarek Y.S., Mandelbrod M., Mass Y., Soffer A., Searching xml documents via xml fragments, Proceedings of the 26th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Informaion Retrieval, SIGIR, pp. 151-158, (2003); Schenkel R., Theobald A., Weikum G., Semantic similarity search on semistructured data with the XXL search engine, Information Retrieval, 8, 4, pp. 521-545, (2005); Rijsbergen C.J.V., Information Retrieval, (1979); Luk R.W., Leong H.V., Dillon T.S., Chan A.T., Croft W.B., Allan J., A survey in indexing and searching xml documents, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, JASIST, 53, 6, pp. 415-437, (2002); Graupmann J., Schenkel R., The light-weight semantic web: Integrating information extraction and information retrieval for heterogeneous environments, Proceedings of the SIGIR 2005 Workshop on Heterogeneous and Distributed Information Retrieval, pp. 1-8, (2005); Cohen S., Mamou J., Kanza Y., Sagiv Y., Xsearch: A semantic search engine for xml, Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, pp. 45-56, (2003); Geva S., Gpx gardens point xml ir at inex 2005, Advances in XML Information Retrieval and Evaluation: Forth International Workshop of the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval, INEX, pp. 240-253, (2005); Geva S., Gpx - Gardens point xml IR at Inex 2006, Advances in XML Information Retrieval and Evaluation: Fifth International Workshop of the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval, INEX, pp. 211-223, (2006); Chamberlin D., Berglund A., Boag S., Fernndez M.F., Kay M., Robie J., Simon J., Xml Path Language (Xpath) 2.0, (2006); Schenkel R., Theobald A., Weikum G., Hopi: An efficient connection index for complex xml document collections, Proceedings of 9th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, EDBT, pp. 237-255, (2004); Graupmann J., Schenkel R., Weikum G., The spheresearch engine for unified ranked retrieval of heterogeneous xml and web documents, Proceedings of the 3st International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, VLDB, pp. 529-540, (2005); Al-Adhaileh M.H., Kong T.E., Example-based machine translation based on the synchronous SSTC annotation schema, Proceedings of Machine Translation Summit VII, pp. 244-249, (1999); Al-Adhaileh M.H., Kong T.E., Yusoff Z., A synchronization structure of sstc and its applications in machine translation, Proceedings of International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING, pp. 1-8, (2002)","S.S.
