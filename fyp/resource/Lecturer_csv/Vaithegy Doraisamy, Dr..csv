It is a network that provides online gaming services to mobile users. This paper proposes a model to enhance the existing MCG model by introducing Mobile Cloud Cloudlet Gaming (MCCG) system to provide better gaming service to the mobile users by reducing the transmission latency by placing Cloudlet as an intermediate between main cloud and mobile nodes. Besides that, the mobile nodes within the transmission area of cloudlet can form ad hoc network to share data among the devices when the cloudlet has reached its maximum capacity. Clustered Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (c-DSDV) protocol is also introduced in this paper work to further reduce the transmission delay between the ad-hoc cloudlet and mobile nodes. Besides reducing latency, the model also could reduce congestion and enable low-end mobile devices to join MCG services.

VOD System over MANET is an interactive multimedia system that provides video services to mobile clients. Mobile clients who use the system will encounter high service delay to watch their favorite movie and this is the main problem in this system. The proposed caching scheme is called Neighborhood-Initial Playback Based Caching Scheme (NIPBCS) to overcome the service delay in the system. In NIPBC, when a new client enters the MANET network, the Local Forwarder (LF) will detect the new client upon arrival and will send the 1st segment of a movie to the new client's First buffer. The new client can request for the 1st segment of its favorite movie by tuning in to a channel from the Staggered Broadcasting Protocol that will broadcast the 1st segment of the movie or the new client can request from the neighbors. If the new clients' favorite movie is the same as the 1st segment of a movie sent by the LF, the client can just switch to the First Buffer and start watching the movie. By this way the aim of this caching scheme is achieved that is to reduce the time delay in VOD system over MANET. The performance of the system is evaluated through a simulation study and the extensive simulation was conducted to get the performance result of the NIPBCS. The result obtained from the simulation shows that NIPBCS reduces 10% of the time delay of the system compared to the existing caching scheme.","MANET; NIPBCS; Staggered broadcast; VoD","Interactive computer systems; Mobile ad hoc networks; Motion pictures; Multimedia services; Multimedia systems; Time delay; User interfaces; Video on demand; Caching scheme; Caching system; Extensive simulations; Interactive multimedia; MANET; Mobile client; NIPBCS; Service delays; Simulation studies; Staggered broadcast; Staggered broadcasting; Video services; VoD; Ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Yang H.L., Lin Q.F., Clickstream analysis on WMC platform, JCIT: Journal of Convergence Information Technology, 6, 1, pp. 212-217, (2011); Jesse T., Statistics: The state of the internet video, Digital Buzz, (2010); Adrew L., Top U.S. online video properties, ComScore, (2008); Tran Duc.

In this proposed work, a Pre-Stored Cloudlet is introduced. Pre-stored Cloudlet is where the Cloudlet is pre-stored with encoded game videos in it transmitted from the Main Cloud. The main drawbacks of the existing Mobile Cloud Gaming (MCG) are long distances between the Cloud and mobile users, strongly dependent on network, it consumes high bandwidth and causes latency. We proposed a system architecture to overcome the existing problem in MCG by introducing Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc mobile network into the architecture of MCG. Ad Hoc mobile network is formed within the range of Pre-Stored Cloudlets to enable the users to get the pre-rendered game videos from the nearby users. The proposed system has THREE main layers; Cloud, Cloudlet and mobile users and the video transmission is expected to happen between these layers aided with WiMax and WiFi connection. The architecture is implemented through simulation and it is simulated to find the Response Delay which consist of Network Delay, Processing Delay, and Playout Delay. Based on the simulation results obtained, it shows that the introduction of Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc environment has helped to decrease the latency in game video transmission. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ad Hoc; Cloudlet; Mobile Cloud Gaming; Network Delay; Playout Delay; Processing Delay; Response Delay","Computer architecture; Image communication systems; Intelligent computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Ad Hoc; Cloudlet; Mobile clouds; Network delays; Playout delay; Processing delay; Response delays; Mobile ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Srivastava P., Khan R., A review paper on cloud computing, Int.
