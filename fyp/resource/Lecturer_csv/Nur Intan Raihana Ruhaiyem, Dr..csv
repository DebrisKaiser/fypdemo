Ltd., Cape Town, 7764, South Africa","This article provides a comprehensive review of deep learning-based blood vessel segmentation of the brain. Cerebrovascular disease develops when blood arteries in the brain are compromised, resulting in severe brain injuries such as ischemic stroke, brain hemorrhages, and many more. Early detection enables patients to obtain more effective treatment before becoming critically unwell. Due to the superior efficiency and accuracy compared to manual segmentation and other computer-assisted diagnosis procedures, deep learning algorithms have been extensively deployed in brain vascular segmentation. This study examined current articles on deep learning-based brain vascular segmentation, which examined the proposed methodologies, particularly the network architectures, and determined the model trend. We evaluated challenges and crucial factors associated with the application of deep learning to brain vascular segmentation, as well as future research prospects. This paper will assist researchers in developing more sophisticated and robust models in the future to develop deep learning solutions.  © 2013 IEEE.","Brain vessel segmentation; convolutional neural network; deep learning; magnetic resonance angiogram","Blood vessels; Computer aided diagnosis; Deep neural networks; Learning algorithms; Network architecture; Patient treatment; Blood-vessel segmentations; Brain injury; Brain vessel segmentation; Brain vessels; Cerebrovascular disease; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Magnetic resonance angiogram; Vascular segmentations; Vessel segmentation; Magnetic resonance","","","","","","","Fang M.C., Perraillon M.C., Ghosh K., Cutler D.M., Rosen A.B., Trends in stroke rates, risk, and outcomes in the United States, 1988 to 2008, Amer.

Motion capture (MoCap) is used for recording the movement of people for clinical, ergonomic and rehabilitation solutions. However, knowledge barriers about these MoCap systems have made them difficult to use for many people. Despite this, no state-of-the-art literature review on MoCap systems for human clinical, rehabilitation and ergonomic analysis has been conducted. A medical diagnosis using AI applies machine learning algorithms and motion capture technologies to analyze patient data, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, enabling early disease detection and facilitating personalized treatment plans. It revolutionizes healthcare by harnessing the power of data-driven insights for improved patient outcomes and efficient clinical decision-making. The current review aimed to investigate: (i) the most used MoCap systems for clinical use, ergonomics and rehabilitation, (ii) their application and (iii) the target population. We used preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines for the review. Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were used to search for relevant published articles. The articles obtained were scrutinized by reading the abstracts and titles to determine their inclusion eligibility. Accordingly, articles with insufficient or irrelevant information were excluded from the screening. The search included studies published between 2013 and 2023 (including additional criteria). A total of 40 articles were eligible for review. The selected articles were further categorized in terms of the types of MoCap used, their application and the domain of the experiments. This review will serve as a guide for researchers and organizational management. © 2023 by the authors.","EMG; hands; IMS systems; MBased systems; MLess systems; shoulder","adult; clinical decision making; connective tissue; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; diagnostic test accuracy study; ergonomics; female; health care; health care management; human; human activities; knee; law enforcement; machine learning; male; materials handling; Medline; outcome assessment; patient coding; practice guideline; range of motion; Review; Scopus; search engine; systematic review; treatment outcome; video game; virtual reality; Web of Science; work environment","","","","","King Khalid University, KKU; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Khalid University, (RGP2/52/44)","Funding text 1: The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University for funding this work through a large group Research Project under grant number (RGP2/52/44). ; Funding text 2: Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University funded this work through a large group Research Project under grant number (RGP2/52/44).","Fernandez I.G., Ahmad S.A., Wada C., Inertial Sensor-Based Instrumented Cane for Real-Time Walking Cane Kinematics Estimation, Sensors, 20, (2020); Ferrari E., Gamberi M., Pilati F., Regattieri A., Motion Analysis System for the Digitalization and Assessment of Manual Manufacturing and Assembly Processes, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 51, pp. 411-416, (2018); Hood S., Ishmael M.K., Gunnell A., Foreman K.B., Lenzi T., A Kinematic and Kinetic Dataset of 18 Above-Knee Amputees Walking at Various Speeds, Sci.

White matter hyperintensity is one of the most commonly reported neuroimaging markers of CSVD and is linked with an increased risk of future stroke and vascular dementia. Recent attention has focused on the search of CSVD biomarkers. The objective of this study is to explore the potential of fractal dimension as a vascular neuroimaging marker in asymptomatic CSVD with low WMH burden. Df is an index that measures the complexity of a self-similar and irregular structure such as circle of Willis and its tributaries. This exploratory cross-sectional study involved 22 neurologically asymptomatic adult subjects (42 ± 12 years old; 68% female) with low to moderate 10-year cardiovascular disease risk prediction score (QRISK2 score) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA) brain scan. Based on the MRI findings, subjects were divided into two groups: subjects with low WMH burden and no WMH burden, (WMH+; n = 8) and (WMH−; n = 14) respectively. Maximum intensity projection image was constructed from the 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MRA. The complexity of the CoW and its tributaries observed in the MIP image was characterised using Df. The Df of the CoW and its tributaries, i.e., Df (w) was significantly lower in the WMH+ group (1.5172 ± 0.0248) as compared to WMH− (1.5653 ± 0.0304, p = 0.001). There was a significant inverse relationship between the QRISK2 risk score and Df (w), (rs = −.656, p = 0.001). Df (w) is a promising, non-invasive vascular neuroimaging marker for asymptomatic CSVD with WMH. Further study with multi-centre and long-term follow-up is warranted to explore its potential as a biomarker in CSVD and correlation with clinical sequalae of CSVD. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Biomarkers; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fractals; Humans; Male; Neuroimaging; biological marker; cerebrovascular disease; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; female; fractal analysis; human; male; neuroimaging","","Biomarkers, ","","","Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, HUSM","The authors would like to acknowledge Dr Muhammad Hakimi Mohd Rashid, Amanina Ahmad Safri and Mazira Mohamad Ghazali for their contributions in this study.

This reaction has both positive and negative effects on everyone’s life. Therefore, stress management is of vital importance in maintaining the psychological balance of a person. Thermal-based imaging technique is becoming popular among researchers due to its non-contact conductive nature. Moreover, thermal-based imaging has shown promising results in detecting stress in a non-contact and non-invasive manner. Compared to other non-contact stress detection methods such as pupil dilation, keystroke behavior, social media interaction and voice modulation, thermal-based imaging provides better features with clear boundaries and requires no heavy methodology. This paper presented a brief review of previous work on thermal imaging related stress detection in humans. This paper also presented the stages of stress detection based on thermal face signatures such as dataset type, thermal image face detection, feature descriptors and classification performance comparisons are presented. This paper can help future researchers to understand stress detection based on thermal imaging by presenting the popular methods previous researchers use for stress detection based on thermal images. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Data were retrospectively collected from women who came to the Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia for breast-related problems. Eight ML models were used: k-nearest neighbour (kNN), elastic-net logistic regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, artificial neural network, partial least square, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting. Features utilised for the development of the screening models were limited to information in the patient registration form. The final model was evaluated in terms of performance across a mammographic density. Additionally, the feature importance of the final model was assessed using the model agnostic approach. kNN had the highest Youden J index, precision, and PR-AUC, while SVM had the highest F2 score. The kNN model was selected as the final model. The model had a balanced performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and PR-AUC across the mammographic density groups. The most important feature was the age at examination. In conclusion, this study showed that ML and patient registration information are feasible to be used as the OTC screening model for breast cancer. © 2022 by the authors.","Asian women; breast cancer; clinical decision support systems; explainable artificial intelligence; machine learning; medical consultation delays; screening model","adult; Article; breast cancer; breast density; cancer classification; cancer patient; cancer risk; cancer screening; consultation; controlled study; feasibility study; female; human; k nearest neighbor; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; middle aged; multivariate analysis; partial least squares regression; patient registry; random forest; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; Youden index","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/SKK03/USM/02/1)","This research was funded by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia (FRGS/1/2019/SKK03/USM/02/1).","DeSantis C.E., Bray F., Ferlay J., Lortet-Tieulent J., Anderson B.O., Jemal A., International variation in female breast cancer incidence and mortality rates, Cancer Epidemiol.

Unfortunately, the awareness of early sign of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is still insufficiently provided to the public. Arm flapping is a good example of a stereotypical behavior of ASD early sign. Typically, a standard Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBSR) - set of questionnaire - used by clinicians for ASD diagnosis usually involved multiple and long sessions that apparently would delay and may have nonconformity. Thus, we aim to propose a computational framework to semi-automate the diagnosis process. We used human action recognition (HAR) algorithm. HAR involved in human body detection and the skeleton representation to show the arm asymmetrical in arm flapping movement which indicates the possibility of ASD signs by extracting the body pose into stickman model. The proposed framework has been tested against the video clips of children performing arm flapping behavior taken from public dataset. The outcome of this study is expected to detect early sign of ASD based on asymmetry measurement of arm flapping behavior. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Arm flapping; ASD early detection; Autism spectrum disorder; Body postures; HAR algorithm; Skeleton representation","Musculoskeletal system; Arm flapping; Asymmetry measurements; Autism spectrum disorders; Body postures; Computational framework; Human-action recognition; Skeleton representation; Stereotypical behavior; Diseases","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (304/PKOMP/6313259)","Acknowledgments.

Estimating oil palm tree age automatically through computer vision would be beneficial for plantation management. In this work, the object detection technique is proposed by applying high-resolution satellite imagery, tested with four different deep learning architectures, namely SSD, Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, and EfficientDet. The models are trained using TensorFlow Object Detection API and assessed with performance metrics and visual inspection. It is possible to produce automated oil palm trees detection model on age range estimation, either young or mature based on the crown size. Faster R-CNN is identified as the best model with total loss of 0.0047, mAP of 0.391 and mAR of 0.492, all with IoU threshold from 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05.

The compartment consists of arterial blood, tissues and venous blood. Fick’s principle and the law of mass action were used to develop the model based on the diffusion process. The model is modified into a fractional pharmacokinetics model with the sense of Caputo derivative. The existence and uniqueness of the model are investigated and the positivity of the model is established. The behaviour of the model is investigated by implementing numerical algorithms for the numerical solution of the system of fractional differential equations. MATLAB software is used to plot the graphs for illustrating the variation of drug concentration concerning time. Therefore, the numerical simulations of the model are presented for different values of α which verified the theoretical analysis. Besides, we also observed the pattern of the simulations at the three-compartment of the model by using different values of initial conditions. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Hand-based multibiometric system is the most successful and used in many real time systems especially law enforcement and forensics. Moreover, it is very user friendly and ease of use among all other biometric traits. Multi classifier fusion is the use of more classifiers for each modality involved rather than single at the score fusion of multibiometric system. Furthermore, hand-based multimodal biometrics can use either or all traits of fingerprint, palm print, finger vein, palm vein, dorsal vein, hand geometry, finger knuckle print and many more. In this paper, we reviewed various score normalization techniques and multi-classifiers used in the hand-based multimodal biometrics for each modality involved at the matching score fusion for enhancing the system performance further. © 2017 IEEE.","Multi-classifier; Multimodal biometrics; Score fusion","Biometrics; Interactive computer systems; Biometrie; Biometrie systems; Emerging trends; Intra-class variation; Multi-classifier; Multi-modal; Multi-modal biometrics; Multibiometric systems; Score fusion; Score normalization; Real time systems","","","","","","","Wozniak M., Et al., A survey of multi-classifier as hybrid systems, Information Fusion, (2014); Aravinth J., Valarmathy S., Multi classifier-based score level fusion of multi-modal biometric recognition and its application to remote biometrics authentication, The Imaging Science Journal, 64, 1, pp. 1-14, (2016); Saigaa M., Et al., Hand-based Biometric for Personal Identification Using Correlation Filter Classifier, (2014); Ramalho M., Et al., Secure multispectral hand recognition system, European Signal Processing Conference, Spain, (2011); Zhu L.Q., Et al., Multimodal Biometric Identification System Based on Finger Geometry, Knuckle Print, and Palm Print, (2010); Peng J., Et al., Multimodal biometric authentication based on score level fusion of finger biometrics, Optik, (2014); Karthik, Et al., Score Level Fusion using Hybrid BF-pfPSO for Face and Fingerprint Multimodal Biometric System, IEEE Conference Proceedings, ICECS, (2016); Bharathi S., Et al., Hand Vein-based Multimodal Biometric Recognition, Acta Polytechnica Hungarica, 12, 6, (2015); Sumathi S., Et al., Multimodal Biometrics for Person Authentication using Hand Image, Ijca, 70, 24, (2013); Nandakumar R.K., Jain A.K., Handbook of Multibiometrics, (2006); Esther, Et al., A multimodal biometric system based on palm print and finger knuckle print recognition methods, An International Arab Journal of Information Technology, 12, 2, (2015); Kumar A., Et al., Personal authentication using finger knuckle surface, IEEE Trans.

To overcome these problems, a technique has been proposed to detect defects automatically and effectively using the image segmentation technique. Although, this technique has been well developed, it does suffer from several disadvantages of radiographic images taken to be poor in quality, as well as the microscopic size of the defects together with poor orientation relatively to the small size and thickness of the evaluated parts. Using image segmentation algorithm allows the defects to be automatically inspected and measured within the welded surface such as cracks, porosity and foreign inclusions, which may be weakening the welded parts. This paper proposes a system to automatically identifies and classifies the faults from the welding process by using the existing image segmentation algorithms. The output of the developed system produces a measured analysis which can be then used to describe the mechanical properties of welded part of the alloy such as its tensile and force. The benefits of this project will improve the welding process to reduce faults and defects for both constructing and manufacturing fields.","Automatic laser welding; Classification; Defect detection; Sobel-contour shape","","","","","","","","Li C.-T., Chiao R., Multiresolution genetic clustering algorithm for texture segmentation, Image and Vision Computing, 21, 11, pp. 955-966, (2003); Richardson I.E., H.264 and MPEG-4 Video Compression: Video Coding for Next-generation Multimedia, (2003); Nejatpour R., Sadabad A.A., Automated weld defects detection using image processing and cad methods, ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, (2008); Parvati K., Prakasa Rao B.S., Mariya Das M., Image segmentation using gray-scale morphology and marker-controlled watershed transformation, Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society, (2008); Singh K., Singh A., A study of image segmentation algorithms for different types of images, IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science, 7, (2010); Bala A., An improved watershed image segmentation technique using matlab, International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, 3, (2012); Shen J., Application of Image Segmentation In Inspection Of Welding-Practical research in MATLAB, (2012); Dass R., Devi P.S., Image segmentation techniques, IJECT, 3, 1, (2012); Chaudhary A., Gulati T., Segmenting digital images using edge detection, International Journal of Application of Innovation in Engineering & Management, 2, 5, (2013); WELDER'S Visual Inspection, pp. 32-33, (2013); Narsimhachary D., Effect of Laser Welding Parameters on 6061 Aluminium Alloy, (2014); Nand G.K., Neogi N.N., Defect detection of steel surface using entropy segmentation, Annual IEEE India Conference, (2014); Alam M.A., Ali M.M.N., Syed M.A.A., Sorif N., Rahaman M.A., An Algorithm to Detect and Identify Defects of Industrial Pipes Using Image Processing, (2014); Cogranne R., Statistical detection of defects in radiographic images using an adaptive parametric model, Signal Processing, 96, 8, pp. 173-189, (2014); Madani S., Azizi M., Detection of Weld Defects in Radiography Films Using Image Processing, 9, (2015); Che Jamil M.S., Imam Fauzi E.R., Juinn C.S., Sheikh M.A., Laser bending of pre-stressed thin-walled nickel microtubes, Journal of Optics & Laser Technology, 73, pp. 105-117, (2015)","","","Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka","","","","","","21801843","","","","English","J.

Adaptive step size is introduced instead of fixed step size by random walk of the Fire Fly Algorithm (FFA) in the tumble move of the bacterium at the chemo-taxis stage of BFO. So that, the slow convergence of the BFO algorithm is mitigated. PSO algorithm is acted as mutation operator to attain the global best. So, the trapping out in the local optima by PSO is being avoided. BFO algorithm is used to attain the local best optimality. The new algorithm is tested on a set of benchmark functions. The proposed hybrid algorithm is compared with the original BFO and PSO algorithm. It has been proved that the proposed algorithm shows the significance than the classical BFO and PSO algorithms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Adaptive step size; Bacterial foraging optimization; Fire fly algorithm; Particle swarm optimization","Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Adaptive step size; Bacterial foraging optimization; Bacterial foraging optimization algorithms; Bacterial swarm optimizations; Benchmark functions; Mutation operators; Optimization algorithms; Slow convergences; Optimization","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6313280)","Acknowledgements.

Segmentation of brain tumors involves distinguishing normal brain tissue from malignant tissue. When evaluating brain tumors, it is possible to determine the existence of tumor tissue quickly. However, accurate and reproducible segmentation and characterization of anomalies are not readily achievable. Consequently, several researchers have proposed various biomedical image segmentation methods to distinguish between tumor and normal brain tissue reliably. However, state-of-the-art segmentation has not been achieved by the existing brain tumor segmentation models, and they often come with high model complexity. Att-Sharp-U-net, a model influenced by the actual U-net model utilized in various medical image segmentation research, is presented as a contribution by this study. Two critical alterations to the underlying U-net model have been incorporated into the model: a grid-based attention block and a sharp block. By doing this, we were able to address the constraints of the U-net model while simultaneously enhancing segmentation performance with increasing negligible computational complexity. Experiments on the Brats2020 dataset, a recent publicly available benchmark dataset in brain tumor segmentation, showed that the proposed model improved segmentation performance with a dice score of 0.9275 and Jaccard score of 0.8684 when compared to the baselines.  © 2022 IEEE.","Attention; Brain tumor segmentation; Deep learning; Medical Image segmentation","Benchmarking; Brain; Deep learning; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Attention; Brain tissue; Brain tumor segmentation; Brain tumors; Deep learning; Medical image segmentation; Mortality rate; Net model; Salient feature extraction; Segmentation performance; Tumors","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2021/ICT04/USM/02/1)","V.

In this study, we identified the risk factors of mammographic density in Asian women and quantified the impact of breast density on the severity of breast cancer. We collected data from Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, a research-and university-based hospital located in Kelantan, Malaysia. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyse the data. Five significant factors were found to be associated with mammographic density: age (OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.96), number of children (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.96), body mass index (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.92), menopause status (yes vs. no, OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.82), and BI-RADS classification (2 vs. 1, OR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.84; 3 vs. 1, OR: 3.25; 95% CI: 1.86, 5.66; 4 vs. 1, OR: 3.75; 95% CI: 1.88, 7.46; 5 vs. 1, OR: 2.46; 95% CI: 1.21, 5.02; 6 vs. 1, OR: 2.50; 95% CI: 0.65, 9.56). Similarly, the average predicted probabilities were higher among BI-RADS 3 and 4 classified women. Understanding mammographic density and its influencing factors aids in accurately assessing and screening dense breast women. © 2022 by the authors.

The IMNEP stands for Interactive Multimedia-based Nutrition Education Package which comprise of a digital game namely MakanSihatSaya and 6 animated explainer videos, supported with physical activity component using Xbox 360 exergame. The intervention aims at providing the children and parents or caretaker with precise dietary guideline related to childhood obesity and encourage them to practice healthy eating and be active physically. The package was developed based on literature and pilot study, followed by evaluation through a 6-month randomized-controlled trial among obese primary school children in Kota Bharu, Malaysia. Significant improvement in obesity outcomes were evidenced among the children at the end of the trial. In summary, video and game are highly effective modes of intervention, particularly in the prevention and management of obesity problems among children due to their attention-grabbing and engaging features. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Children; Interactive multimedia; Obesity; Video-based","Interactive computer systems; Multimedia systems; Child; Dietary Guidelines; Digital games; Effectiveness evaluation; Evidence-based; Exergames; Interactive multimedia; Physical activity; Video-based; Xbox 360; Nutrition","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6315321)","Acknowledgement.

It is a very important and active research topic with many areas of application, such as identifying a person, trustworthiness, demographic analysis, safety and health knowledge, visual monitoring, and aging progress. Data matching is to identify the gender of the person and his age. Thus, the study touches on a review of many research papers from 2016 to 2022. At the heart of the topic, many systematic reviews of multimodal pedagogies in Age and Gender Estimation for Adaptive were undertaken. However, no current study of the theme concerns connected to multimodal pedagogies in Age and Gender Estimation for Adaptive Learning has been published. The multimodal pedagogies in four different databases within the keywords indicate the heart of the topic. A qualitative thematic analysis based on 48 articles found during the search revealed four common themes, such as multimodal engagement and speech with the Human-Robot Interaction life world. The study touches on the presentation of many major concepts, namely Age Estimation, Gender Estimation, Speaker Recognition, Speech recognition, Speaker Localization, and Speaker Gender Identification. According to specific criteria, they were presented to all studies. The essay compares these themes to the thematic findings of other review studies on the same topic such as multimodal age, gender estimation, and dataset used. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis based on the surveyed region. The study provides a platform for professors, researchers, and students alike, and proposes directions for future research. © 2023 by the authors.","age estimation; dataset; gender estimation; image; multimodal; speech","","","","","","","","Badr A.A., Abdul-Hassan A.K., Estimating Age in Short Utterances Based on Multi-Class Classification Approach, Comput.

The rising death rate among women due to breast cancer is a worldwide health concern that can only be addressed by early diagnosis and frequent screening. Mammography has been the most utilized breast imaging technique to date. Radiologists have begun to use computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems to improve the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis by minimizing human errors. Despite the progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical field, this study indicates that systems that can anticipate a treatment plan once a patient has been diagnosed with cancer are few and not widely used. Having such a system will assist clinicians in determining the optimal treatment plan and avoid exposing a patient to unnecessary hazardous treatment that wastes a significant amount of money. To develop the prediction model, data from 336,525 patients from the SEER dataset were split into training (80%), and testing (20%) sets. Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost are utilized with feature importance to build the treatment prediction model. The best overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) achieved was 0.91 using Random Forest on the SEER dataset. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

Hence, a miniaturized satellite such as CanSat and CubeSat, is introduced. The invention of microelectronics has produced these satellites with most of the functionality of an OSCAR satellite, allowing a more cost-effective space research to be conducted. Generally, both CubeSat with a 10 cm cubesized, and CanSat with a size of soda can, have the subsystems consisting of power supply, payload, altitude determination and control system, communication system and on-board computer. Commonly, CubeSat is developed using off-the-shelf computer system which is expensive. As for the past few years, many researchers have tried developing CubeSat's onboard data handling (OBDH) system using Raspberry Pi, for its cheaper price, as its on-board computer in order to provide control for a more complicated space mission. With the implementation of Raspberry Pi as on-board computer, School of Aerospace Engineering plans to build a CubeSat to conduct research specifically on measuring electron density in the Ionosphere E-layer. Hence, this research project has produced a complete OBDH system with the ability to integrate with other related subsystems, as well as gather and store useful data which can be displayed on a web application for real-time monitoring and learning purpose. Besides, this web application is developed to provide a learning platform for all to ensure everyone have equal access to technical education to solve one of target in the Fourth Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). © 2020 IEEE.","CubeSat; internet of things; miniaturized satellite; on board data handling; online learning","Altitude control; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; E region; Interplanetary flight; Microelectronics; Small satellites; Space research; Spacecraft power supplies; Altitude determinations; Learning platform; Onboard computers; Onboard data handling; Real time monitoring; Space explorations; Technical educations; WEB application; Computer control systems","","","","","","","Sabri S.F., Yuhaniz S.S., Kamardin K., Designing a low cost cubesats command and data handling subsystem kit, ARPN J.

Industries specialize in manufacturing Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA), also implementing manual visual inspection in In Process Quality Control (IPQC) verification process to ensure quality of products. Such technology advancement has increased workload of operators and time taken to perform inspection. This study is aimed to reduce time consumption and cognitive load of operators, while ensuring consistency of visual inspection during component verification process by utilizing deep learning models to perform object detection based automated optical inspection of images consisting electronic components. Three deep learning algorithms were used in the study, which are Faster R-CNN, YOLO v3 and SSD FPN. Both Faster R-CNN and SSD FPN utilized ResNet-50 backbone, whereas YOLO v3 was built with Darknet-53 backbone. Various input image dimension and image resizing options were explored to determine the best model for object detection. At the end of the study, SSD FPN with input image dimension resized to 640 × 640 by keeping image aspect ratio and with padding is concluded as the best localization and classification model to perform object detection for various types of components present in digital image. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Deep learning; Object detection; Printed circuit board; Printed circuit board assembly","Aspect ratio; Deep learning; Inspection; Network components; Object recognition; Printed circuit boards; Timing circuits; Automated optical inspection; Component size; Deep learning; Electronic component; Electronic industries; Input image; Objects detection; Printed circuit boards assemblies; Verification process; Visual inspection; Object detection","","","","","","","Abd Al R., Mousavi A., A review and analysis of automatic optical inspection and quality monitoring methods in electronics industry, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 183192-183271, (2020); Baumgartner C.F., Kamnitsas K., Matthew J., Smith S., Kainz B., Rueckert D., Real-time standard scan plane detection and localisation in fetal ultrasound using fully convolutional neural networks, International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, pp. 203-211, (2016); Chen S.H., Tsai C.C., SMD LED chips defect detection using a YOLOv3-dense model, Adv.

We employ the subset of machine learning called deep learning to the real-time face recognition system as the deep face recognition technique has improved the state-of-the-art performance. This system uses a pre-trained model named FaceNet and employs triplet loss technique to impose a margin between every pair of faces from the same person to other faces. In other words, it minimizes the distance between the anchor and the positive from the same identity and maximizes the distance between the anchor and the negative from different identity. Furthermore, to further investigate the performance of the system, we implement the Tensorflow framework to improve the system performance by the usage of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This system uses Labeled Faces in Wild (LFW) dataset as the benchmark to test the performance of the face recognition system. Apart from that, we conduct a preliminary experiment to evaluate the performance of haarcascade classifiers so that we can choose the best classifier in term of accuracy and speed. Haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml (FD) exhibits best performance compared to haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml (FA) and haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml (FA2) with accurate number of faces detected and shortest average time taken to detect faces. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Deep learning; Face recognition; Tensorflow","Benchmarking; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Deep learning; Graphics processing unit; Machine learning; Program processors; Statistical tests; Face recognition systems; Face recognition technique; Real-time face recognition; Real-time face recognition system; State-of-the-art performance; System use; Tensorflow; Face recognition","","","","","","","Trigueros D.S., Meng L., Hartnett M., Face Recognition: From Traditional to Deep Learning Methods, (2018); Sukri S.S., Ruhaiyem N.I.R., Mohamed A.S.A., Face recognition with real time eye lid movement detection, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics, (2017); Wagh P., Et al., Attendance system based on face recognition using eigen face and PCA algorithms, Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Green Computing and Internet of Things, Icgciot 2015, pp. 303-308, (2016); Ara N.M., Simul N.S., Islam M.S., Convolutional neural network approach for vision based student recognition system, 20Th International Conference of Computer and Information Technology, ICCIT 2017, pp. 1-6, (2018); Arsenovic M., Et al., FaceTime-deep learning based face recognition attendance system, Proceedings of SISY 2017-IEEE 15Th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics, pp. 53-57, (2017); Neeraj S., Sugandha S., Survey of advanced face detection techniques in image processing, Int.

To date, there is still no superior method can segment all types of images either in 2D or 3D. A popular technique: bilateral filter, a non-linear method used to efficiently eliminate noise while preserving object’s edges, has two parameters: domain and range kernel, and widely used for medical image segmentation. Unlike medical images, noise on electron tomogram, are diverse in terms of its density and intensity. Therefore, this research proposed a modification on the two kernels: the existing Gaussian domain kernel replaced by Sobel and Canny edge detector to improve the edge detector element and the existing Gaussian range kernel replaced by an inverted Gaussian kernel serves to highlight different regions. The results of bilateral filter using Canny as the high-pass domain kernel show efficient detection accordingly as the pixel intensity changes, in comparison to the results of Sobel as domain kernel, and to the techniques engaging filter along: Sobel and Canny edge detectors. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bilateral filter; Canny edge detector; Electron tomogram segmentation; Gaussian filter; High-pass domain kernel; Sobel edge detector","Gaussian distribution; High pass filters; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Pulse shaping circuits; Bilateral filters; Canny edge detectors; Electron tomogram segmentation; Electron tomograms; Evidence-based; Gaussian filters; High-pass; High-pass domain kernel; Images processing; Sobel edge detectors; Nonlinear filtering","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6315321)","Acknowledgments.

To date, we could find many skin care products sold not only in pharmacy but also from individual business. However, not all products suitable for all skin types. As a normal human, we sometimes not know the type of rashes or allergies that we faced. Meeting dermatologist would not be the first choice for many patients – given that the fees are expensive especially. Skin rashes can occur to anybody and an early recognition could avoid the rash become worse. Seeking information online would be the first choice, however patients still in high possibilities in mistakenly buy skin care products. Therefore, the development of the augmented reality application for skin rashes and allergies detection is expected can solve the problem. With the help of dermatologist and healthcare people, the information in this application is established and trustable. Among the advantages of this application are the ability in detecting of different types of skin rashes, displaying informative details on the detected skin rashes to reduce wrong judgement on the allergies the patient faced, and reasonable processing speed on mobile screen. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","3D modeling; Augmented reality; Image processing; Mobile application; Skin rashes","Allergies; Augmented reality; Augmented reality applications; Human bodies; Image modeling; Mobile screens; Processing speed; Skin rashes; Skin care products","","","","","","","Eriksen K., Nielsen B.E., Pittelkow M., Visualizing 3D molecular structures using an augmented reality app, J.

Failure to adhere to dietary intake recommendation, was one of the most significant factors affecting patient survival. Technology-mediated approach such as web and mobile application could be the most desirable approach nowadays. This paper presents the SMARTS dual application modules development by using ADDIE model, beginning with the analysis of needs, followed by content and face validation in the design phase, and finally the development of application prototype. The application system was designed to enable seamless access, interaction, and monitoring between all the involved users; patient, caretaker, and Healthcare Provider (HCP). Twenty-five respondents involved in the need assessment and also face and validity testing, Most of them are dietitian from government hospital (n = 16, 64%), university medical centers (n = 6, 24%) and private hospital (n = 2, 8%), with ample experience managing hemodialysis patients. Majority of them rated the content (84%), and purpose of the app as a new nutrition education tool (84%) as the most appealing properties of the app, followed by the visual appealing (68%), and variety of topics offered (40%). Some improvisation was suggested on the comprehension and quality of the text, inclusion of nutrient tracker, presentation of education messages in video format, and adding more visuals rather than textual information to enhance understanding. The SMARTS D4D module was well-accepted and supportive of respondents’ needs. Appropriate modifications have been done based on the valuable respondents’ feedbacks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Application module; Dietary plan; Hemodialysis; Kidney failure","Dialysis; Hemodialyzers; Hospitals; Nutrition; Application module; Application systems; General population; Health care providers; Hemodialysis patient; Mobile applications; Private hospitals; Textual information; Software prototyping","","","","","","","Bujang M.A., Adnan T.H., Hashim N.H., Mohan K., Kim Liong A., Ahmad G., Haniff J., Forecasting the incidence and prevalence of patients with end-stage renal disease in Malaysia up to the year 2040, Int.

The hybridization of the algorithm was conducted by incorporating Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to mitigate weaknesses in slow and premature convergence. In the proposed HIBS algorithm, the slow convergence of BFO algorithm was mitigated by using the random walk procedure of Firefly algorithm as an adaptive varying step size instead of using fixed step size. Concurrently, the local optima trap (i.e. premature convergence) of PSO algorithm was averted by using mutation operator. The HIBS algorithm was tested using benchmark functions and compared against classical BFO, PSO and other hybrid algorithms like Genetic Algorithm- Bacterial Foraging Optimization (GA-BFO), Genetic Algorithm- Particle Swarm Optimization (GA-PSO) and other BFO-PSO algorithms to prove its exploration and exploitation ability. It was observed from the experimental results that the EER values, after the influence of the proposed HIBS algorithm, dropped to 0.0070% and 0.0049% from 1.56% and 0.86% for the right and left hand images of the Bosphorus database, respectively. The results indicated the ability of the proposed HIBS in optimization problem where it optimized relevant weights in an authentication system. © 2010, Universiti Utara Malaysia Press.","Bacterial foraging; Biometric authentication system; Firefly algorithm; Particle swarm optimization","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (1001/PKOMP/8014001)","This work was funded by University Research Grant (1001/PKOMP/8014001), Universiti Sains Malaysia.","Alford A., Hansen C., Dozier G., Bryant K., Kelly J., Abegaz T., Woodard D.L., GEC-based multi-biometric fusion, IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, pp. 2071-2074, (2011); Alostaz A., Alhanjouri M., A new adaptive BFO based on PSO for learning neural network, i-Manager's Journal on Computer Science, 1, 3, (2013); Bakwad K.M., Pattnaik S.S., Sohi B.S., Devi S., Panigrahi B.K., Das S., Lohokare M.R., Hybrid bacterial foraging with parameter free PSO, World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing, pp. 1077-1081, (2009); Bao P., Zhang L., Wu X., Canny edge detection enhancement by scale multiplication, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 27, 9, pp. 1485-1490, (2005); Biswas A.D.S., Das S., Abraham A., Synergy of PSO and bacterial foraging optimization: ßA comparative study on numerical benchmarks, Advances in Soft Computing, 44, pp. 255-263, (2007); Cherifi Dalila H.I., Nait-Ali A., Multimodal score-level fusion using hybrid GA-PSO for multibiometric system, Informatica, 39, 2, pp. 837-913, (2015); Daas M.S., Chikhi S., Batouche M., Bacterial foraging optimization with double role of reproduction and step adaptation, Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Information Processing, Security and Advanced Communication, (2015); Eberhart R., Kennedy J., A new optimizer using particle swarm theory, Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Micro Machine and Human Science, pp. 39-43, (1995); Gabi D., Ismail A.S., Zainal A., Zakaria Z., Al-Khasawneh A., Hybrid cat swarm optimization and simulated annealing for dynamic task scheduling cloud computing environment, Journal of ICT, 17, 3, pp. 435-467, (2018); Hanmandlu M., Kumar A., Madasu V.K., Yarlagadda P., Fusion of hand based biometrics using particle swarm optimization, Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations, pp. 783-788, (2008); Jain A.K., Nandakumar K., Ross A., 50 years of biometric research: Accomplishments, challenges, and opportunities, Pattern Recognition Letters, 79, pp. 80-105, (2016); Jarraya Y., Bouaziz S., Alimi A.M., Abraham A., A hybrid computational chemotaxis in bacterial foraging optimization algorithm for global numerical optimization, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics (CYBCO), pp. 213-218, (2013); Kennedy J., Kennedy J.F., Eberhart R.C., Shi Y., Swarm intelligence: The Morgan Kaufmann Series, (2001); Kora P., Kalva S.R., Hybrid bacterial foraging and particle swarm optimization for detecting Bundle Branch Block, SpringerPlus, 4, 1, (2015); Kumar A., Wang B., Recovering and matching minutiae patterns from finger knuckle images, Pattern Recognition Letters, 68, 2, pp. 361-367, (2015); Passino K.M., Biomimicry of bacterial foraging for distributed optimization and control, IEEE Control Systems, 22, 3, pp. 52-67, (2002); Ross A.A., Nandakumar K., Jain A., Handbook of multibiometrics, 6, (2006); Shanmugasundaram K., Mohamed A.S.A., Ruhaiyem N.I.R., Hybrid improved bacterial swarm (HIBS) optimization algorithm, Proceedings of the International Conference of Visual Informatics, pp. 71-78, (2017); Shanmugasundaram K., Mohamed A.S.A., Ruhaiyem N.I.R., An overview of hand-based multimodal biometrie system using multiclassifier score fusion with score normalization, Proceedings of the International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication, pp. 53-57, (2017); Shehab M., Khader A.T., Laouchedi M., A hybrid method based on cuckoo search algorithm for global optimization problems, Journal of ICT, 17, 3, pp. 469-491, (2018); Yan X., Zhu Y., Chen H., Zhang H., Improved bacterial foraging optimization with social cooperation and adaptive step size, Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Computing, pp. 634-640, (2012); Yang X.S., Firefly algorithms for multimodal optimization, Proceedings of the International Symposium on Stochastic Algorithms, pp. 169-178, (2009); Zafar W., Ahmad T., Hassan M., Minutiae based fingerprint matching techniques, Proceedings of the IEEE Seventeenth International Conference on Multi-Topic, pp. 411-416, (2014)","","","Universiti Utara Malaysia Press","","","","","","1675414X","","","","English","J.

Thus, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of the medical workflow of the disease. Therefore, this study aims to develop a supplementary diagnostic tool for radiologists using ensemble transfer learning and digital mammograms. The digital mammograms and their associated information were collected from the department of radiology and pathology at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia. Thirteen pre-trained networks were selected and tested in this study. ResNet101V2 and ResNet152 had the highest mean PR-AUC, MobileNetV3Small and ResNet152 had the highest mean precision, ResNet101 had the highest mean F1 score, and ResNet152 and ResNet152V2 had the highest mean Youden J index. Subsequently, three ensemble models were developed using the top three pre-trained networks whose ranking was based on PR-AUC values, precision, and F1 scores. The final ensemble model, which consisted of Resnet101, Resnet152, and ResNet50V2, had a mean precision value, F1 score, and Youden J index of 0.82, 0.68, and 0.12, respectively. Additionally, the final model demonstrated balanced performance across mammographic density. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the good performance of ensemble transfer learning and digital mammograms in breast cancer risk estimation. This model can be utilised as a supplementary diagnostic tool for radiologists, thus reducing their workloads and further improving the medical workflow in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; Asian women; breast cancer; deep learning; diagnostic screening; mammography; radiologists; transfer learning","Article; artificial intelligence; breast cancer; breast density; breast imaging reporting and data system; cancer diagnosis; cancer risk; comparative study; controlled study; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; digital mammography; female; human; image processing; Malaysia; residual neural network; sensitivity and specificity; transfer of learning; Youden index","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/SKK03/USM/02/1)","This research was funded by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) of the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia (FRGS/1/2019/SKK03/USM/02/1).","Arnold M., Morgan E., Rumgay H., Mafra A., Singh D., Laversanne M., Vignat J., Gralow J.R., Cardoso F., Siesling S., Et al., Current and future burden of breast cancer: Global statistics for 2020 and 2040, Breast, 66, pp. 15-23, (2022); Ferlay J., Colombet M., Soerjomataram I., Parkin D.M., Pineros M., Znaor A., Bray F., Cancer statistics for the year 2020: An overview, Int.

By incorporating prior knowledge about the organelle's morphology and image features, the required number of parameter tweaking can be reduced substantially. In practical applications, however, the general organelles' features are often known in advance, yet the actual organelles' morphology is not elaborated. Two primary contributions of this paper are firstly the classification of insulin granules based on its image features and morphology for accurate segmentation - mainly focused at pre-processing image segmentation and secondly the new hybrid meshing quantification is presented. The method proposed in this study is validated on a set of manually defined ground truths. The study of insulin granules in particular; the location, and its image features has also opened up other options for future studies.","","","","","","","","","Olofsson C.S., Salehi A., Holm C., Rorsman P., Palmitate increases l- Type ca2+ currents and the size of the readily releasable granule pool in mouse pancreatic beta- cells, Journal of Physiology, 557, pp. 935-948, (2004); Hutton J.C., The insulin secretory granule, Diabetologia, 32, pp. 271-281, (1989); Howell S.L., The molecular organization of the beta granule of the islets of langerhans, Advances in Cytopharmacology, 2, pp. 319-327, (1974); Ladinsky M.S., Wu C.C., Mcintosh S., Mcintosh J.R., Howell K.E., Structure of the golgi and distribution of reporter molecules at 20 degrees c reveals the complexity of the exit compartments, Molecular Biology of the Cell, 13, pp. 2810-2825, (2002); Marsh B.J., Lessons from tomographic studies of the mammalian golgi, Biochemical and Biophysics Acta, 1744, pp. 273-292, (2005); Russ J.C., Dehoff R.T., Practical Stereology, (2000); Derganc J., Mironov A.A., Svetina S., Physical factors that affect the number and size of golgi cisternae, Traffic, 7, pp. 85-96, (2006); Griffiths G., Fuller S.D., Back R., Hollinshead M., Pfeiffer S., Simons K., The dynamic nature of the golgi complex, Journal of Cell Biology, 108, pp. 277-297, (1989); Marsh B.J., Mastronarde D.N., Buttle K.F., Howell K.E., Mcintosh J.R., Organellar relationships in the golgi region of the pancreatic beta cell line, hit t15, visualized by high resolution electron tomography, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science U S a, 98, pp. 2399-2406, (2001); Ladinsky M.S., Mastronarde D.N., Mcintosh J.R., Howell K.E., Staehelin L.A., Golgi, structure in three dimensions: Functional insights from the normal rat kidney cell, Journal of Cell Biology, 144, pp. 1135-1149, (1999); Nurntan Raihana R., Multiple, Object-oriented Segmentation Methods of Mammalian Cell Tomograms, (2014); Rorsman P., Renstrom E., Insulin granule dynamics in pancreatic beta cells, Diabetologia, 46, pp. 1029-1045, (2003); Noske A.B., Costin A.J., Morgan G.P., Marsh B.J., Expedited approaches to whole cell electron tomography and organelle mark-up in situ in high-pressure frozen pancreatic islets, Journal of Structural, Biology, 161, pp. 298-313, (2008); Kremer J.R., Mastronarde D.N., Mcintosh J.R., Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using imod, Journal of Structural Biology, 116, pp. 71-76, (1996); Nurntan Raihana R., Semi- Automated cellular tomogram segmentation workflow (ctsw): Towards an automaic target scoring system, The International Conference on Computer Graphics, Multimedia and Image Processing, (2014)","","","Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka","","","","","","21801843","","","","English","J.
