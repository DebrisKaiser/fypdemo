(2001) to count certain subwords in the word w. Subsequently, several investigations on various properties of Parikh matrices have been done. Parikh matrices of words that involve certain weak ratio-property are investigated by Subramanian et al (2009). On the other hand a morphism f is a mapping on words u,v whose images f(u), f(v) are also words with the property that f(uv) = f(u)f(v). Thue morphism on a binary alphabet is a special kind of morphism. Here we consider a generalization of Thue morphism, introduced by Seebold (2003) but restricting it to three symbols. We obtain certain properties of images of binary words under this generalized Thue morphism and also of their Parikh matrices, in the context of the weak ratio-property. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.","Morphism; Parikh matrix; Subword; Word","","","","","","","","Lothaire M., Combinatorics on Words, (1983); Lothaire M., Applied Combinatorics on Words, (2005); Berstel J., Perrin D., European J.

The situation poses a need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of capacity planning and resource optimization while still maintaining their flexibilities. Machine loading - one of the important components of capacity planning is known for its complexity that encompasses various types of flexibilities pertaining to part selection, machine and operation assignment along with constraints. Various studies are done to balance the productivity and flexibility in flexible manufacturing system (FMS). From the literature, the researchers have developed many approaches to reach a suitable balance of exploration (global improvement) and exploitation (local improvement). We adopt hybrid of population approaches; Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Harmony Search algorithm (H-GaHs), to solve this problem that aims on mapping the feasible solution to the domain problem. The objectives are to minimize the system unbalance as well as increase throughput while satisfying the technological constraints such as machine time availability and tool slots. The proposed algorithm is tested for its performance on 10 sample problems available in FMS literature and compared with existing solution approaches. © 2011 IEEE.","Flexible manufacturing system; Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Harmony Search; Machine loading; System unbalance; Throughput","Competition; Computation theory; Genetic algorithms; Loading; Machine components; Optimization; Problem solving; Bio-inspired; Capacity planning; Domain problems; Feasible solution; Harmony search algorithms; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Machine loading; Machine time; Manufacturing industries; Part selection; Product cycle time; Product variety; Resource optimization; Solution approach; System unbalance; Technological constraints; Flexible manufacturing systems","","","","","","","Viswanadham N., Narahari Y., Performance Modeling of Automated Manufacturing Systems, (1992); Stecke K.E., Formulation and solution of nonlinear integer production planning problems for flexible manufacturing systems, Management Science, 29, 3, pp. 273-288, (1983); Kumar A., Prakash, Tiwari M.K., Shankar R., Baveja A., Solving machine-loading problem of a flexible manufacturing system with constraint-based genetic algorithm, European Journal of Operational Research, 175, 2, pp. 1043-1069, (2006); Srinivas, Tiwari M.K., Allada V., Solving the machine-loading problem in a flexible manufacturing system using a combinatorial auction-based approach, International Journal of Production Research, 42, 9, pp. 1879-1893, (2004); Ammons J.C., Lofgren C.B., McGinnis L.F., A large scale machine loading problem in flexible assembly, Annals of Operations Research, 3, 7, pp. 317-332, (1985); Shanker Kripa, Tzen Ya-Juei Jeffrey, Loading and dispatching problem in a random flexible manufacturing system, International Journal of Production Research, 23, 3, pp. 579-595, (1985); Mukhopadhyay S.K., Maiti Bibekananda, Garg Sandip, Heuristic solution to the scheduling problems in flexible manufacturing system, International Journal of Production Research, 29, 10, pp. 2003-2024, (1991); Tiwari M.K., Vidyarthi N.K., Solving machine loading problems in a flexible manufacturing system using a genetic algorithm based heuristic approach, International Journal of Production Research, 38, 14, pp. 3357-3384, (2000); Li Y.I.W.H.W.D.W., Genetic algorithm approach to earliness and tardiness production scheduling and planning problem, International Journal of Production Economics, 54, pp. 65-76, (1998); Yogeswaran M., Ponnambalam S.G., Tiwari M.K., An efficient hybrid evolutionary heuristic using genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm to solve machine loading problem in fms, International Journal of Production Research, 47, 19, pp. 5421-5448, (2009); Che Z.-H., Using hybrid genetic algorithms for multi-period product configuration change planning, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 6, 6, pp. 2761-2785, (2010); Geem Z.W., Kim J.H., Loganathan G.V., A new heuristic optimization algorithm: Harmony search, Simulation, 76, 2, pp. 60-68, (2001); Geem Z.W., School Bus Routing Using Harmony Search, (2005); Geem Z., Improved harmony search from ensemble of music players, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4251, (2006); Al-Betar M., Khader A., A harmony search algorithm for university course timetabling, Annals of Operations Research, pp. 1-29, (2010); Goldberg D.E., Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning, (1989); Saravanan R., Manufacturing Optimization Through Intelligent Techniques, (2006); Bloomfield M.W., Herencia J.E., Weaver P.M., Analysis and benchmarking of meta-heuristic techniques for lay-up optimization, Computers & Structures, 88, 5-6, pp. 272-282, (2010); Michalewicz Z., Nazhiyath G., Genocop iii: A co-evolutionary algorithm for numerical optimization problems with nonlinear constraints, IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation, 2, pp. 647-651, (1995); Cormier D., O'Grady P., Sanii E., A constraint-based genetic algorithm for concurrent engineering, International Journal of Production Research, 36, 6, pp. 1679-1697, (1998); Mukhopadhyay A., Roy A., Das S., Abraham A., Populationvariance and explorative power of harmony search: An analysis, Digital Information Management, 2008.

However, it is considered as one of the most difficult NP-hard problems, which means that no polynomial-time algorithm is known to solve this intractable problem effectively. Even small instances of QAP may require vast computation time. In this work, a uniform cellular solution to QAP is proposed in the framework of membrane computing by using a family of recognizer tissue P systems with cell division. In the design of the solution, we encode the given instances in binary notations.

We propose a new technique to represent and learn various gait component relationships using a recently developing statistical relational learning technique called Markov Logic Networks. Markov Logic Network is a robust statistical learning technique that fuses expressive first-order logic with probabilistic graphical models and prove to be efficient in handling noisy and uncertain data. Initially we derive component based pattern classifiers in the imaging domain using an automatic segmentation scheme and represent gait components and their relationships using first-order logic. Then we model and learn their characteristics using undirected graphs to finally classify gaits based on standard inference techniques. The proposed approach enables automatic gait recognition from low resolution videos and differs from conventional techniques which rely on manual markings on videos. We show that the proposed representation provide intuitive means to reason gait component relationships. Our results show that the proposed approach competes well with other state-of-the-art techniques.","Biometrics; Gait recognition; Logic-based fusion; Markov Logic Networks","Biometrics; Gait analysis; Information fusion; Learning algorithms; Speech recognition; Automatic segmentations; Component based; Conventional techniques; First order logic; Gait recognition; Inference techniques; Logic-based fusion; Low resolution video; Markov Logic Networks; Pattern classifier; Probabilistic graphical models; Statistical learning techniques; Statistical relational learning; Uncertain datas; Undirected graph; Probabilistic logics","","","","","","","Cutting J., Kozlowski L., Recognizing friends by their walk: Gait perception without familiarity cues, Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society, Tech.

For crowd safety, it is very important to study the evolution of potential crowd behaviours by simulating the crowd evacuation process. Planning crowd control tasks by studying the impact of crowd behaviour evolution towards evacuation could mitigate the possibility of crowd disasters. During a typical emergency evacuation scenario, conflict among agents occurs when agents intend to move to the same location as a result of the interaction with their nearest neighbours. The effect of the agent response towards their neighbourhood is vital in order to understand the effect of variation of crowd behaviour on the whole environment. In this work, we model crowd motion subject to exit congestion under uncertainty conditions in a continuous space via computer simulations. We model best-response, risk-seeking, risk-averse and risk-neutral behaviours of agents via certain game-theoretic notions. We perform computer simulations with heterogeneous populations in order to study the effect of the evolution of agent behaviours towards egress flow under threat conditions. Our simulation results show the relation between the local crowd pressure and the number of injured agents. We observe that when the proportion of agents in a population of risk-seeking agents is increased, the average crowd pressure, average local density and the number of injured agents increases. Besides that, based on our simulation results, we can infer that crowd disasters could be prevented if the agent population consists entirely of risk-averse and risk-neutral agents despite circumstances that lead to threats. © 2019, University of Surrey.

Reasoning pedestrian motion via computational intelligence techniques could be posed as a potential research problem within the realms of Artificial Intelligence. In this contribution, we propose a ""Bayesian Network Model for Pedestrian Dynamics"" (BNMPD) to reason the vast uncertainty imposed by pedestrian motion. With reference to key findings from literature which include simulation studies, we systematically identify: What are the various factors that could contribute to the prediction of crowd flow status? The proposed model unifies these factors in a cohesive manner using Bayesian Networks (BNs) and serves as a sophisticated probabilistic tool to simulate vital cause and effect relationships entailed in the pedestrian domain. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.","Bayesian networks; Crowd disaster; Crowd evacuation; Directed acyclic graphs; Pedestrian dynamics","Artificial intelligence; Dynamics; Bayesian network models; Bayesian Networks (bns); Cause-and-effect relationships; Computational intelligence techniques; Crowd disaster; Crowd evacuation; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Pedestrian dynamics; Bayesian networks","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, (203/PTS6728001)","","Helbing D., Johansson A., Al-Abideen H.Z., Dynamics of crowd disasters: An empirical study, Physical Review e, 75, 4, pp. 1-7, (2007); Wagner U., Faelker A., Wenzel V., Fatal incidents by crowd crush during mass events.

However due to low computing capacity, complicated algorithms are incompatible to be performed on the device, with sparse information further limits the feature available for extraction. Therefore, a classification method which could receive sparse input, while providing ample leverage for the classification process to accurately differentiate objects within limited computing capability is required. To achieve reliable feature extraction from a sparse LiDAR point cloud, this paper proposes a novel Clustered Extraction and Centroid Based Clustered Extraction Method (CE-CBCE) method for feature extraction followed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) object classifier. The integration of the CE-CBCE and CNN methods enable us to utilize lightweight actuated LiDAR input and provides low computing means of classification while maintaining accurate detection. Based on genuine LiDAR data, the final result shows reliable accuracy of 97% through the method proposed. © 2021 Mohd Romlay et al.

The purpose of this study is to model, simulate and visualize crowd dynamics applicable to emergency situations via human-like intelligent agents governed by the rules of fuzzy-logic. At the micro level the crowd is perceived as a group of individual agents (pedestrians). During an emergency situation each agent’s goal is to evacuate through an exit. This study cohesively deploys fuzzy-logic based control mechanisms to determine the degree of emergency level pertaining to each agent in the crowd. Further, Unity based simulation and visualization models are proposed to display critical areas of the crowd during a typical evacuation process. Results justify the fact that the evacuation time taken shows significant increments proportional to the population size of the agents while the percentage of emergency level portrays quite similar trends. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

In this contribution, a novel approach is proposed to increase the RP of the 3D reconstruction PCA-based model by deforming a set of examples in the training dataset. By adding these deformed samples together with the original training samples we gain more RP. A 3D PCA-based model is adapted for each new input face image by deforming 3D faces in the training data set. This adapted model is used to reconstruct the 3D face shape for the given input 2D near frontal face image. Our experimental results justify that the proposed adaptive model considerably improves the RP of the conventional PCA-based model. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.","3D face reconstruction; PCA; Representational Power; Statistical facial modeling; TPS","Deformation; Face recognition; Information science; 3D face reconstruction; Facial model; PCA; Representational Power; TPS; Three dimensional","","","","","","","Atick J., Griffin P., Redlich A., Statistical approach to shape from shading: Reconstruction of three-dimensional face surfaces from single two-dimensional images, Neural Computation, 8, 6, pp. 1321-1340, (1996); Besl P., McKay H., A method for registration of 3D shapes, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 14, 2, pp. 239-256, (1992); Blanz V., Vetter T., Face recognition based on fitting a 3D morphable model, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 25, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2003); Blanz V., Vetter T., A morphable model for the synthesis of 3D faces, Proceedings of the 26th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, SIGGRAPH 1999, pp. 187-194, (1999); Bookstein F.L., Principal warps: Thin-plate splines and the decomposition of deformations, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis AndMachine Intelligence, 11, 6, pp. 567-585, (1989); Bottino A., De Simone M., Laurentini A., Sforza C., A new 3D tool for planning plastic surgery, IEEE Transactions on Bio-medical Engineering, (2012); Brown B., Rusinkiewicz S., Non-rigid range-scan alignment using thin-plate splines, Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on 3D Data Processing, Visualization and Transmission, 3DPVT 2004, pp. 759-765, (2004); Elyan E., Ugail H., Reconstruction of 3D human facial images using partial differential equations, JCP, pp. 1-8, (2007); Fanany M.I., Ohno M., Kumazawa I., Face Reconstruction from Shading Using Smooth Projected Polygon Representation NN, Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Vision Interface, Calgary, Canada, pp. 308-313, (2002); Farkas L.G., Anthropometry of the Head and Face, (1994); Hu Y., Jiang D., Yan S., Zhang L., Automatic 3D reconstruction for face recognition, Proceedings of the Sixth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, pp. 843-848, (2004); Jiang D., Hu Y., Yan S., Zhang L., Zhang H., Gao W., Efficient 3D reconstruction for face recognition, Pattern Recogn., 38, pp. 787-798, (2005); Kemelmacher-Shlizerman I., Basri R., 3D face reconstruction from a single image using a single reference face shape, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 33, 2, pp. 394-405, (2011); Knothe R., Romdhani S., Vetter T., Combining PCA and LFA for surface reconstruction from a sparse set of control points, 7th International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, FGR 2006, pp. 637-644, (2006); Levine M.D., Yu Y., State-of-the-art of 3D facial reconstruction methods for face recognition based on a single 2D training image per person, Pattern Recogn.

Various developments continue to take place in the process of eﬃcient evacuation of crowd in mass gatherings. This article is intended to provide an analysis on crowd evacuation models based on the game theory approach. There will be interaction among evacuees in which the evacuees tend to be either cooperator or defector in order to move towards desired path. This paper analyzes in detail the pure and mixed strategy of Nash Equilibrium (NE) and Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) as a result of diﬀerent types of interaction among evacuees under diﬀerent scenarios that possibly could happen during normal and emergency evacuation. We found out that due to the higher cost of interrupting than the value of beneﬁt able to move, the proportion of defectors playing the ESS will decrease compared to the proportion of cooperators playing the ESS. © 2016 ICIC International.","Evacuation simulation; Evolutionary stable strategy; Game theory","Active area; Crowd evacuation; Emergency evacuation; Evacuation management; Evacuation simulation; Evolutionary stable strategies; Mixed strategy; Nash equilibria; Game theory","","","","","","","Johansson A., Batty M., Hayashi K., Al Bar O., Marcozzi D., Memish Z.A., Crowd and environmental management during mass gatherings, The Lancet Infect Diseases, 12, 2, pp. 150-156, (2012); Helbing D., Johansson A., Al-Abideen H.Z., Dynamics of crowd disasters: An empirical study, Physical Review E, 75, 4, (2007); Hughes R.L., A continuum theory for the ﬂow of pedestrians, Transportation Research Part B, 36, pp. 507-535, (2002); Helbing D., Farkas I., Vicsek T., Freezing by heating in a driven mesoscopic system, Phys.

On the other hand BPG array P system with array objects and basic puzzle grammar (BPG) rules was introduced as a variant of array generating P systems that were developed with a view to link the two areas of membrane computing and picture array grammars. Here we incorporate the feature of permitting symbols in the rules of the BPG array P system, thus introducing permitting array P system with BPG rules (pAP(BPG)).

Methods of generation of the kolam diagrams were developed based on two-dimensional picture generating models, broadly known as array grammars, introduced for the description and analysis of picture patterns. Rewriting array P system, a membrane computing model based on array rewriting has been developed to evolve picture arrays, based on context-free array rewriting rules. In contrast to this array P system, another P system model called contextual array P system (CAP) using contextual array rules for the evolution or generation of picture arrays has been proposed and its power in generating picture arrays investigated. Here we develop an application of CAP for the generation of the kolam diagrams. The advantage of using CAP is that kolam diagrams that cannot be handled by array grammars can be generated by the CAP model. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Array grammars; Array P system; Contextual array rules; Floor-designs; Kolam patterns","Computation theory; Floors; Array grammar; Context-free; Contextual array rules; Generating models; Kolam patterns; Membrane computing; P systems; Rewriting rules; Graphic methods","","","","","University Grants Commission, UGC, (F.6-6/2016-17/EMERITUS-2015-17-GEN-5933 / (SA-II); Universiti Sains Malaysia","Acknowledgement.

We model crowd motion subject to exit congestion under uncertainty conditions in a continuous space and compare the proposed model via simulations with the classical social force model. During a typical emergency evacuation scenario, agents might not be able to perceive with certainty the strategies of opponents (other agents) owing to the dynamic changes entailed by the neighborhood of opponents. In such uncertain scenarios, agents will try to update their strategy based on their own rules or their intrinsic behavior. We study risk seeking, risk averse and risk neutral behaviors of such agents via certain game theory notions. We found that risk averse agents tend to achieve faster evacuation time whenever the time delay in conflicts appears to be longer. The results of our simulations also comply with previous work and conform to the fact that evacuation time of agents becomes shorter once mutual cooperation among agents is achieved. Although the impatient strategy appears to be the rational strategy that might lead to faster evacuation times, our study scientifically shows that the more the agents are impatient, the slower is the egress time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Evolution of crowd behavior; Game theory; Spatial evacuation model; Uncertainty","Game theory; Risk analysis; Continuous spaces; Crowd behavior; Emergency evacuation; Evacuation modeling; Intrinsic behavior; Pedestrian movement; Social force models; Uncertainty; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Burstedde C., Klauck K., Schadschneider A., Zittartz J., Simulation of pedestrian dynamics using a two-dimensional cellular automaton, Physica A, 295, 3, (2001); Tajima Y., Nagatani T., Scaling behavior of crowd flow outside a hall, Physica A, 292, 1, pp. 545-554, (2001); Kirchner A., Schadschneider A., Simulation of evacuation processes using a bionics-inspired cellular automaton model for pedestrian dynamics, Physica A, 312, 1, pp. 260-276, (2002); Helbing D., Isobe M., Nagatani T., Takimoto K., Lattice gas simulation of experimentally studied evacuation dynamics, Phys.

In high-density crowd events which happen frequently, panic or an emergency can lead to an increase in congestion which may cause disastrous incidents. Crowd control planning via simulation of people’s movement and behavior can promote safe departures from a space, despite threatening circumstances. Up until now, the evolution of distinctive types of crowd behavior towards cooperative flow remains unexplored. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the impact of potential crowd behavior, namely best-response, risk-seeking, risk-averse, and risk-neutral agents in achieving cooperation during evacuation and its connection with evacuation time using a game-theoretic evacuation simulation model. We analyze the crowd evacuation of a rectangular room with either a single-door or multiple exits in a continuous space. Simulation results show that mutual cooperation during evacuation can be realized when the agents’ population is dominated by risk-averse agents. The results also demonstrate that the risk-seeking agents tend toward aggressiveness by opting for a defector strategy regardless of the local crowd densities, while other crowd behavior shows cooperation under high local crowd density. © The Author(s) 2022.","agent-based model; behavioral model; cooperation dilemma; Evacuation simulation; evolutionary game theory","Autonomous agents; Behavioral research; Computational methods; Multi agent systems; Risk analysis; Agent-based model; Behavior strategy; Behavioral model; Cooperation dilemma; Crowd behavior; Crowd density; Crowd evacuation; Evacuation simulation; Evolutionary game theory; Risk averse; Game theory","","","","","International Islamic University Malaysia, IIUM","This research is supported by the IRAGS 2018 Grant: IRAGS18-014-0015 awarded by the International Islamic University Malaysia.

Tikhonov regularization is a popular method that incorporates prior information towards providing the existence of closed-form solutions which we obtain as a result of applying PCA, in order to solve the ill-posed problem. The common factors that generally affect Tikhonov regularization are the regularization matrix, the number of feature points, regularization parameters and noise. In this study we report our findings on how various factors influence the reconstruction accuracy based on a case study performed on the USF Human ID 3D database. Further, a statistical comparison between two Tikhonov regularization matrices viz., the identity matrix and the diagonal matrix comprising of the eigenvalues (eigenvalue matrix), has been performed. We found that, the reconstruction error can be reduced significantly by using the later one. Finally our study aids to determine the most feasible interval in conjunction with optimal regularization parameters which would lead towards achieving accurate and plausible solutions. © SCRG Publication, 2013.","3D face reconstruction; PCA; Tikhonov regularization","","","","","","","","Kemelmacher-Shlizerman I., Basri R., 3D Face Reconstruction from a Single Image Using a Single Reference Face Shape, Pattern Analysis, and Machine Intelligence, 33, pp. 394-405, (2011); Atick J.J., Griffin P.A., Redlich A.N., Statistical approach to shape from shading: Reconstruction of three-dimensional face surfaces from single two-dimensional images, Neural Computation, 8, pp. 1321-1340, (1996); Zhang R., Tsai P.S., Cryer J.E., Shah M., Shape-from-shading: a survey, Pattern Analysis, and Machine Intelligence, 21, pp. 690-706, (1999); Smith W.A., Hancock E.R., Recovering facial shape using a statistical model of surface normal direction, Pattern Analysis, and Machine Intelligence, 28, pp. 1914-1930, (2006); Nandy D., Ben-Arie J., Shape from recognition: a novel approach for 3- D face shape recovery, Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on, 10, pp. 206-217, (2001); Lin C.T., Cheng W.C., Liang S.F., Neural-network-based adaptive hybrid-reflectance model for 3-D surface reconstruction, Neural Networks, 16, pp. 1601-1615, (2005); Nagai T., Naruse T., Ikehara M., Kurematsu A., HMM-based surface reconstruction from single images, in Image Processing. 2002.

Among the visual human emotional cues, facial expressions are the most commonly used and understandable cues. Different machine learning techniques have been utilized to solve the expression recognition problem; however, their performance is still disputed. In this paper, we investigate the capability of several classification techniques to discriminate between the six universal facial expressions using Speed Up Robust Features (SURF). The evaluation were conducted using the BU-3DFE database with four classifiers, namely, Support Vector machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Naïve Bayes (NB). Experimental results show that the SVM was successful in discriminating between the six universal facial expressions with an overall recognition accuracy of 79.36%, which is significantly better than the nearest accuracy achieved by Naïve Bayes at significance level p < 0.05. © 2014 IEEE.","3D Facial Expression Recognition; Human-computer interaction; k-nearest neighbors; Naïve Bayes; Neural Network; Support Vector machine","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Human computer interaction; Learning systems; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Sodium; Support vector machines; 3-D facial expression recognition; Analysis and evaluation; Classification technique; Expression recognition; Human computer interaction (HCI); K-nearest neighbors; Machine learning techniques; Universal facial expressions; Face recognition","","","","","","","Segal J., Jaffe J., The Language of Emotional Intelligence, (2008); Bahreini K., Nadolski R., Westera W., Towards multimodal emotion recognition in e-learning environments, Interactive Learning Environments,no.

The reliability and accuracy of sequence analyses depend on the quality of MSA. Including anchor points into multiple sequence alignment to be aligned has been proved to be a good way to increase the quality of MSA. In this paper, we have applied Shared Near Neighbors method to construct the anchor points as partial alignment columns which will be aligned for final output. These anchor points can be used as guide with DIALIGN-TX method to overcome the limitation of DIALIGN-TX to increase the accuracy of final MSA. The results showed 4-8% improvement in the six reference sets in BAliBASE 3.0 benchmark regarding to CS score compared to DIALIGN-TX. In addition, it achieved the highest overall mean Q-score and CS score comparing to other MSA methods in IRMBASE 2.0 benchmark. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","anchor points; multiple sequence alignment;

We have proposed and compared wavelet based four blind invisible watermarking methods that have used face image as watermark. Two watermarking methods are based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and rest two watermarking methods are based on the redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT). One watermarking method in each transform incorporates weighted binary coding to achieve improved reliability of extracted watermark. Other watermarking methods replace original image coefficients with face image coefficients. We have observed that DWT based watermarking methods outperform RDWT based watermarking methods. We have compared the robustness of the proposed watermarking methods against various common image processing attacks/operations. We have observed that DWT based watermarking method coupled with weighted binary coding has the best performance without attacks; peak signal to noise ratio value of watermarked image is greater than 50 dB and normalized correlation coefficient value of extracted watermark is 1 at the watermark embedding strength of 1. Moreover, the same watermarking method has the best robustness against most of the attacks. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Biometrics; Discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Normalized correlation coefficient (NC); Peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR); Redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT); Watermarking","Binary codes; Bins; Biometrics; Digital watermarking; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image coding; Image processing; Signal to noise ratio; Watermarking; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Invisible watermarking; Normalized correlation coefficient; Owner identification; Peak signal to noise ratio; Redundant discrete wavelet transform; Watermark embedding; Watermarked images; Watermarking methods; Image watermarking","","","","","University Grants Commission, UGC; Jacobs Research Funds, JRF","One of the authors, Himanshu Agarwal, acknowledges the University Grants Commission (UGC), of New Delhi, India for granting him a scholarship under the JRF scheme for his research.","Bao P., Ma X., Image adaptive watermarking using wavelet domain singular value decomposition, Trans Circuits Syst Video Technol, 15, 1, pp. 96-102, (2005); Barni M., Bartolini F., Piva A., Improved wavelet-based watermarking through pixel-wise masking, IEEE Trans Image Process, 10, 5, pp. 783-791, (2001); Bhatnagar G., Raman B., A new robust reference watermarking scheme based on dwt-svd, Comput Stand Interfaces, 31, 5, pp. 1002-1013, (2009); Bhatnagar G., Raman B., A new robust reference logo watermarking scheme, Multimed Tools Appl, 52, 2-3, pp. 621-640, (2011); Bhatnagar G., Wu Q., Raman B., A new robust adjustable logo watermarking scheme, Comput Secur, 31, 1, pp. 40-58, (2012); Cao J.G., Fowler J.E., Younan N.H., An image-adaptive watermark based on a redundant wavelet transform.

For a given set of data points, knot vectors are computed using the centripetal approach. Next, number of data points is assimilated around the high curvature areas and the parametrization aspect is computed by the inverse chord length with the new set of data points. Second order derivatives are used to determine the high curvature areas of the curves. The method proposed here enables to construct the curves smoothly around high curvature areas by assigning adequate number of data points for the B-splines. Experimental validations justify the fact that the average curve fitting error yielded by the proposed approach is the lowest when compared to other standard curve models. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Centripetal method; Inverse chord length; Non-uniform cubic B-spline; Second order derivative","Algorithms; Information science; Interpolation; Inverse problems; Ship propellers; Analytical approach; Centripetal method; Chord lengths; Cubic B -spline; Experimental validations; Number of datum; Parametrizations; Second order derivatives; Curve fitting","","","","","RU-PRGS Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/811290, 1001/PKOMP/846051)","This research is supported by the RU-PRGS Universiti Sains Malaysia (1001/PKOMP/846051) grant titled “Skull and Photo Superimposition with Conditional Anthropological Parameters using Computer Sciences.” and RUI grant (1001/PKOMP/811290).

Recently, Parikh matrices of words that are images under certain morphisms have been studied for their properties. On the other hand, Parikh matrices of words involving a certain ratio property called weak-ratio property have been investigated by Subramanian et al (2009).

However, their large-scale adaptation for navigation solutions for visually impaired people haven’t been realized yet. Less participation of the visually impaired subject produces a designer-oriented navigation system which overshadows consumer necessity. The outcome results in trust and safety issues, hindering the navigation aids from really contribute to the safety of the targeted end user. This study categorizes electronic travel aids (ETAs) based on experimental evaluations, highlights the designer-centred development of navigation aids with insufficient participation of the visual impaired community. First the research breaks down the methodologies to achieve navigation, followed by categorization of the test and experimentation done to evaluate the systems and ranks it by maturity order. From 70 selected research articles, 51.4% accounts for simulation evaluation, 24.3% involve blindfolded-sighted humans, 22.9% involve visually impaired people and only 1.4% makes it into production and commercialization. Our systematic review offers a bird’s eye view on ETA development and evaluation and contributes to construction of navigational aids which really impact the target group of visually impaired people. © 2021, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The learning models are trained from a set of examples to reach a state where the model will be able to predict the correct output for other examples. PCA-based statistical modeling is a popular technique for modeling 3D faces, which can be used for 3D face reconstruction. The capability of 3D face leaning models in depicting new 3D faces can be considered as the representational power (RP) of the model. This paper focuses on examining the effect of the sample size (number of training faces) on the accuracy of the 3D face shape reconstruction from a small set of feature points. It also aims to visualize the effect of the training sample size on the RP of PCA-based models. Experiments were designed and carried out on testing and training data of the USF Human ID 3D database. We found that although the representational power increases with a larger training sample size, the accuracy of reconstruction is limited by the number of the feature points used. This means that by reconstructing faces from a limited number of feature points, a definite number of examples are sufficient to build a satisfactory 3D face model. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.","3D face reconstruction; PCA; Regularization; Sample size; Statistical face modeling","Face recognition; Information technology; Sampling; 3D face reconstruction; Face modeling; PCA; Regularization; Sample sizes; Three dimensional","","","","","","","Blanz V., Mehl A., Vetter T., Seidel H.-P., A Statistical Method for Robust 3D Surface Reconstruction from Sparse Data, Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium On 3D Data Processing, Visualization, and Transmission, (2004); Luximon Y., Ball R., Justice L., The 3D Chinese head and face modeling, Computer- Aided Design, 44, pp. 40-47, (2012); Widanagamaachchi W.N., Dharmaratne A.T., 3D Face Reconstruction from 2D Images, Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications, pp. 365-371, (2008); Martin D.L., Yingfeng Y., State-of-the-art of 3D facial reconstruction methods for face recognition based on a single 2D training image per person, Pattern Recogn.

In the proposed HSO-EBGM, a recent evolutionary approach called harmony search optimization is tailored to automatically determine optimal facial landmarks. A novel notion of face subgraphs have been formulated with the aid of these automated landmarks that maximizes the similarity entailed by the subgraphs. For experimental evaluation, two sets of de facto databases (i.e., AR and Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) ver2.0) are used to validate and analyze the behavior of the proposed HSO-EBGM in terms of number of subgraphs, varying occlusion sizes, face images under controlled/ideal conditions, realistic partial occlusions, expression variations and varying illumination conditions. For a number of experiments, results justify that the HSO-EBGM shows improved recognition performance when compared to recent state-of-the-art face recognition approaches. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Face recognition; Graphical model; Harmony search; Occlusion; Optimization","Computer graphics; Graphic methods; Optimization; Elastic bunch graph matching; Experimental evaluation; Face recognition grand challenges; GraphicaL model; Harmony search; Harmony search optimizations; Illumination conditions; Occlusion; Face recognition","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This research is supported by the RUI Grant: RUI#1001/pkomp/811290 awarded by Universiti Sains Malaysia.

In an ASN P system with spiking rules of categories (a, ā) and (a, ā) without forgetting rules, the neurons change spikes to anti-spikes or change anti-spikes to spikes; such systems are proved to be universal. We also prove that ASN P systems with inhibitory synapses using pure spiking rules of category (a, ā) and forgetting rules are universal.

Motivated by this special characteristic, facial expression recognition rapidly gains attention in social computing fields, especially in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Identifying the optimal set of facial emotion markers is an important technique that not only reduces the feature vector dimensionality, but also impacts the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new emotion marker identification algorithm for automatic and person-independent 3D facial expression recognition system. First, we mapped the 3D face images into the 2D plane via conformal geometry to reduce the dimensionality. Then, the identification algorithm is designed to seek the best discriminative markers and the classifier parameters simultaneously by integrating three techniques viz., Differential Evolution (DE), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Speed Up Robust Feature (SURF). The proposed system yielded an average recognition rate of 79% and outperformed the previous studies using the Bosphorus database. © 2014 IEEE.","3D facial expression recognition; DE; Emotion marker identification; HCI; SURF; SVM","Evolutionary algorithms; Human computer interaction; Optimization; Social computing; Support vector machines; 3-D facial expression recognition; Differential Evolution; Facial expression recognition; Human computer interaction (HCI); Identification algorithms; Marker identifications; Non-verbal communications; SURF; Face recognition","","","","","","","Ekman P., Friesen W.V., Measuring facial movement, Environmental Psychology and Nonverbal Behavior, 1, 1, pp. 56-75, (1976); Pantic M., Rothkrantz L.J.M., Automatic analysis of facial expressions: The state of the art, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 22, 12, pp. 1424-1445, (2000); Sandbach G., Zafeiriou S., Pantic M., Yin L., Static and dynamic 3D facial expression recognition: A comprehensive survey, Image and Vision Computing, (2012); Valstar M.F., Mehu M., Jiang B., Pantic M., Scherer K., Metaanalysis of the first facial expression recognition challenge, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 42, 4, pp. 966-979, (2012); Storn R., Price K., Differential evolution-a simple and efficient heuristic for global optimization over continuous spaces, Jornal of Global Optimization, 11, 4, pp. 341-359, (1997); Deb K., Multi-objective optimization, Multi-objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, pp. 13-46, (2001); Mishra S., Global Optimization by Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Methods: Evaluation on Some Benchmark Functions, (2006); Rosato M., Chen X., Yin L., Automatic registration of vertex correspondences for 3D facial expression analysis, 2nd IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications and Systems.

There are many algorithms developed to solve MSA, but an efficient computation method with very high accuracy is still a challenge. Progressive alignment is the most widely used approach to compute the final MSA. In this paper, we present a simple and effective progressive approach. Based on the independent order of sequences progressive alignment which proposed in QOMA, this method has been modified to align the whole sequences to maximize the score of MSA. Moreover, in order to further improve the accuracy of the method, we estimate the similarity of any pair of input sequences by using their percent identity, and based on this measure, we choose different substitution matrices during the progressive alignment. In addition, we have included horizontal information to alignment by adjusting the weights of amino acid residues based on their neighboring residues. The experimental results have been tested on popular benchmark of global protein sequences BAliBASE 3.0 and local protein sequences IRMBASE 2.0. The results of the proposed approach outperform the original method in QOMA in terms of sum-of-pair score and column score by up to 14% and 7% respectively. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.","Multiple sequence alignments; Progressive; Protein sequences","","","","","","","","Notredame C., Pharmacogenomics, 3, (2002); Kemena C., Notredame C., Bioinformatics, 25, (2009); Thompson J.D., Plewniak F., Poch O., (1999); Naznin, Sarker R., Essam D., Evol.

The two common factors that are generally concerned with such models are the size of the training dataset and the selection of different examples in the training set. The representational power (RP) of an example-based model is its capability to depict a new 3D face for a given 2D face image. The RP of the model can be increased by correspondingly increasing the number of training samples. In this contribution, a novel approach is proposed to increase the RP of the 3D face reconstruction model by deforming a set of examples in the training dataset. A PCA-based 3D face model is adapted for each new near frontal input face image to reconstruct the 3D face shape. Further an extended Tikhonov regularisation method has been employed to reconstruct 3D face shapes from a set of facial points. The results justify that the proposed adaptive PCA-based model considerably improves the RP of the standard PCA-based model and outperforms it with a 95% confidence level. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.","","3D modeling; Face recognition; Image reconstruction; 3-D face modeling; 3D face reconstruction; Confidence levels; Principle component analysis; Regularisation; Three dimensional (3D) face reconstruction; Training dataset; Training sample; Three dimensional computer graphics","","","","","","","Elyan E., Ugail H., Reconstruction of 3D human facial images using partial differential equations, J.

In order to counter uncertainties imposed by faces captured in such unconstrained imaging situations, a robust, discriminative and computationally efficient feature selection scheme is of paramount significance. In this regard, bio-inspired feature selection methods have been exploited due to their sophisticated ability, flexibility and adaptability. However, their performances tend to deteriorate severely in large-scale domains such as face recognition due to the premature convergence problem. In this paper, high-dimensional LBP features are extracted from face images and fused with Gabor wavelet features using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). To further enhance the discrimination power of the facial representation and to alleviate the curse of dimensionality, a novel membrane-inspired feature selection approach is proposed, where a Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA) under the framework of Membrane Computing (MC) is employed. Inherent parallelism and non-determinism are two distinguishing characteristics of MC that can help in maintaining the diversity of population and balancing the exploration–exploitation trade-off. In the proposed membrane-inspired BBA (MIBBA), the structure as well as the evolution, dissolution and communication rules of MC are integrated into the BBA to enhance the trajectories of bats. Furthermore, the Great Deluge Algorithm (GDA), is integrated into the skin membrane to further improve its exploitation ability. Experimental results show that the proposed approach yields competitive recognition rates and outperforms well-known state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark databases (AR, LFW and GBU). Further experimental evaluations justify the ability of the proposed approach to handle the small sample size problem. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bat algorithm; Face identification; Feature selection; Membrane-inspired evolutionary algorithms; P systems","Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Membranes; Bat algorithms; Canonical correlation analysis; Computationally efficient; Face identification; Feature selection methods; P systems; Small sample size problems; Unconstrained environments; Face recognition","","","","","","","Ahonen T., Hadid A., Pietikinen M., Face recognition with local binary patterns, Computer Vision - ECCV 2004, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3021, pp. 469-481, (2004); Al-Betar A.M., Ahmad N.O., Khader T.A., Awadallah A.M., Incorporating great deluge with harmony search for global optimization problems, Proceedings of Seventh International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA 2012), pp. 275-286, (2013); Alsalibi B., Venkat I., Subramanian K.G., Lutfi S., Wilde P.D., The impact of bio-inspired approaches towards the advancement of face recognition, ACM Comput.

Various developments continue to take place in the process of efficient evacuation of crowds in mass gatherings. This article is intended to provide a review of intelligent evacuation management systems covering the aspects of crowd monitoring, crowd disaster prediction, evacuation modelling, and evacuation path guidelines. Soft computing approaches play a vital role in the design and deployment of intelligent evacuation applications pertaining to crowd control management. While the review deals with video and nonvideo based aspects of crowd monitoring and crowd disaster prediction, evacuation techniques are reviewed via the theme of soft computing, along with a brief review on the evacuation navigation path.

Further, high throughput of proteomics pattern derived from mass spectrometry analysis has embarked new paradigm for biomarker analysis through accessible body fluids such as serum, saliva, and urine. Recently, sophisticated computational techniques that are mimetic natural survival and behaviour of organisms have been widely adopted in problem-solving algorithm. As we put emphasis on feature selection algorithm, the most challenging phase in biomarker analysis is selecting most parsimonious features of voluminous mass spectrometry data. Therefore this study reveals the hybrid artificial bee colony and differential evolution as feature selection techniques exhibits comparable results. These results were compared with other types of bio-inspired algorithms such as ant colony and particle swarm optimisation.

Mobile health-care systems (MHSs) involve the use of superior and reliable communication techniques to deliver biomedical signals over long distances. As MHSs are playing a critical role in human life, assessment is required for these kinds of systems in order to prove their success and failure. Traditional design analysis typically focuses on the system assessment from the technology point of view, whereas sociotechnical analysis looks at how the technology will incorporate into the user’s activities. Based on sociotechnical viewpoint, social and technical issues are complementary and they cannot be separated. This study aims to provide a critical review of the research in this domain and to offer our perspective on possible directions for future mobile health. The focus of this study is on sociotechnical factors that will affect mobile health-care performance. We review sociotechnical factors of different MHSs in order to recognize their effective factors. © 2015 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","","","Akter S., D'Ambra J., Ray P., Service quality of mHealth platforms: Development and validation of a hierarchical model using PLS, Electronic Markets, 20, pp. 209-227, (2010); Akter S., D'Ambra J., Ray P., User perceived service quality of m-health services in developing countries, 18th European Conference on Information Systems, (2010); Akter S., Ray P., mHealth-An ultimate platform to serve the unserved reviews, IMIA Yearbook, pp. 94-100, (2010); Ammenwerth E., Brender J., Nykanen P., Prokosch H.-U., Rigby M., Talmon J., Visions and strategies to improve evaluation of health information systems: Reflections and lessons based on the HIS-EVAL workshop in Innsbruck, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 73, pp. 479-491, (2004); Ammenwerth E., Graber S., Herrmann G., Burkle T., Konig J., Evaluation of health information systems-Problems and challenges, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 71, pp. 125-135, (2003); Anderson J., Aydin C., Overview: Theoretical perspectives and methodologies for the evaluation of healthcare information systems, Evaluating the Organizational Impact of Healthcare Information Systems, (2005); Au-Yeung S.W.M., Response Times in Healthcare Systems, (2007); Bailey J., Pearson S., Development of a tool for measuring and analyzing computer user satisfaction, Management Science, 29, pp. 530-545, (1983); Baumgart D.C., Personal digital assistants in health care: Experienced clinicians in the palm of your hand?, The Lancet, 366, pp. 1210-1222, (2005); Berg M., Patient care information systems and health care work: A sociotechnical approach, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 55, pp. 87-101, (1999); Buyukozkan G., Cifci G., A combined fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS based strategic analysis of electronic service quality in healthcare industry, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, pp. 2341-2354, (2012); Chatterjee S., Chakraborty S., Sarker S., Sarker S., Lau F.Y., Examining the success factors for mobile work in healthcare: A deductive study, Decision Support Systems, 46, pp. 620-633, (2009); Chien T.-N., Hsieh S.-H., Cheng P.-H., Chen Y.-P., Chen S.-J., Luh J.-J., Chen H.-S., Lai J.-S., Usability evaluation of mobile medical treatment carts: Another explanation by information engineers, Journal of Medical Systems, 36, pp. 1327-1334, (2012); Conklin J.H., Gotterer M.H., Rickman J., On-line terminal response time: The effects of background activity, Information and Management, 5, pp. 169-173, (1982); Cousins K.C., Robey D., Human agency in a wireless world: Patterns of technology use in nomadic computing environments, Information and Organization, 15, pp. 151-180, (2005); Cronholm S., Goldkuhl G., Strategies for information systems evaluation-Six generic types, Electronic Journal of Information Systems Evaluation, 6, pp. 65-74, (2003); Daft R.L., Lengel R.H., Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design, Management Science, 32, pp. 554-571, (1986); Dahl Y., Alsos O., Svanaes D., Evaluating mobile usability: The role of fidelity in fullscale laboratory simulations with mobile ict for hospitals, Human-Computer Interaction.

As students have limited sessions with Quran teachers, they resort to Computer Aided Learning (CAL) methods to further enhance their quality of recitations. Unfortunately existing applications that aid in CAL don't provide any feedback mechanisms in terms of ratings/scores about the quality of recitations to end users. The benefits of such feedback mechanisms are quite vital to learners of Holy Quran to improve their learning process stage by stage. Till date, the problem of automating evaluation of Holy Quran recitations using computational techniques remains as a open challenge to researchers. In this research we would investigate this potential problem in brief, propose a basic framework based on a pattern recognition perspective to address the problem and report our preliminary results. © 2015 IEEE.","Hidden Markov Model; Machine learning; Mel-Frequencey Cepstral Coefficients; Pronunciation modeling; Speech processing","Artificial intelligence; Computer aided instruction; Education; Engineering education; Feedback control; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Pattern recognition; Speech processing; Teaching; Cepstral coefficients; Computational technique; Computer aided learning; Face to face; Feedback mechanisms; Learning process; Potential problems; Pronunciation modeling; Learning systems","","","","","","","Bishop C.M., Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, (2006); Salvi G., Mining Speech Sounds: Machine Learning Methods for Automatic Speech Recognition and Analysis, (2006); Nelson K., The Art of Reciting the Quran, (2001); Theory and Practice of Tajwid, (2007); Krajinic E., Tajwid Study, (2012); Paulus J., Klapuri A., Measuring the similarity of rhythmic patterns, Proc. of Third International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR2002), pp. 150-156, (2002); Delgado M., Fajardo W., Molinasolana M., A state of the art on computational music performance, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, pp. 155-160, (2011); Hiraga R., Bresin R., Hirata K., Katayose H., Rencon 2004: Turing test for musical expression, Proceedings of the 2004 Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME04), Singapore, pp. 120-123, (2004); Tepperman J., Narayanan S., Using articulatory representations to detect segmental errors in nonnative pronunciation, IEEE Trans. on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, 6, 1, pp. 8-22, (2008); Pan F., Zhao Q., Yan Y., Automatic tone assessment for strongly accented Mandarin speech, 8th Intl.

Literature reveals that reasoning voluminous mass spectrometry data via sophisticated computational techniques inspired by observing natural processes adapted by biological life has been yielding fruitful results towards the advancement of fields including bioinformatics and proteomics. Such advanced approaches provide efficient ways to mine mass spectrometry data in order to extract discriminating features that aid in discovering vital information, specifically discovering disease-related protein patterns in complex protein sequences. This study reveals the use of artificial bee colony (ABC) as a new feature selection technique incorporated with SVM classifier.

In unconstrained scenarios, faces are often subject to occlusions, apart from common variations such as pose, illumination, scale, orientation and so on. In this paper we propose a novel Bayesian oriented occlusion model inspired by psychophysical mechanisms to recognize faces prone to occlusions amidst other common variations. We have discovered and modeled similarity maps that exist in facial domains by means of Bayesian Networks. The proposed model is capable of efficiently learning and exploiting these maps from the facial domain. Hence it can tackle the occlusion uncertainty reasonably well. Improved recognition rates over state of the art techniques have been observed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Bayesian Networks; Face Recognition; Occlusion Models; Parameter Estimation; Similarity Measures","Bayesian networks; Biometrics; Consumer products; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Parameter estimation; Pattern recognition systems; Bayesian networks; Consumer products; Image analysis; Parameter estimation; Biometric features; Face recognition systems; Occlusion model; Psychophysical; Recognition rates; Similarity measure; State of the art; Bayesian; Biometric features; Face recognition systems; Occlusion model; Psychophysical; Similarity measure; State-of-the-art techniques; Face recognition; Face recognition","","","","","Heriot-Watt University; Universiti Sains Malaysia","Funding text 1: We acknowledge the anonymous reviewers for providing valuable suggestions.

Different from the original GEM model which employs and deforms the mean depth value of 3D sample faces according to a specific 2D input face image, we hypothesise that the variations inherent on the depth information for individuals are significantly mitigated by narrowing down the target information via a selection of specific GEA traits. This is achieved by representing the unknown 3D facial feature points of a 2D input as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of that of the samples of its own GEA type. It is then further incorporated into a Bayesian framework whereby the 3D face reconstruction is posed as estimating the PCA coefficients of a statistical 3D face model, given the observation of 2D feature points, however, with their respective depth as hidden variables. By making the reasonable assumption that the support area of each component of GMM is small enough, the proposed method is reduced to choose the depth values of the features points of a sample face that is nearest to the 2D input face. Thus the 3D reconstruction is obtained with depth-value augmented feature points rather than the 2D ones in normal PCA statistical model based reconstruction. The proposed method has been tested with the USF 3D face database as well as the FRGC dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed S-GEM has achieved improved reconstruction accuracy, consistency, and the robustness over the conventional PCA based and the GEM (mean-face feature points) reconstruction, and also yields enhanced visual improvements on certain facial features. © 2016.

CS makes use of imaging techniques to identify an unknown skull by matching it with the available face photographs of missing individuals. Life-size enlargement of the face image and orientating the skull to correspond to the posture seen in the face photograph are the two main problems that affect identification accuracy with both the conventional and the computer-aided methods. Unlike the existing techniques, this research proposes a 3D skull–3D face model superimposition (3D–3D) approach to address the above two issues. The proposed method commences by reconstructing the 3D face model from a given 2D face image using the mean simplified generic elastic model, followed by registering the face model to a 3D skull along the jaw line using the analytical curvature B-spline (AC B-spline). The accuracy index of the registration is then evaluated to suggest the degree to which the face image corresponds to a skull. The superimpositions of positive and negative cases were conducted on a set of 3D skulls versus a set of 2D face images. The accuracy indices of the registration results suggest that the AC B-spline is more robust in 3D–3D superimposition compared to the other existing methods. The full experimental results have demonstrated the potential of the proposed method as an assistive tool to the forensic scientists for craniofacial identifications. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","3D face reconstruction; B-spline; Craniofacial superimposition; Curve registration; Generic elastic model","3D modeling; Computer forensics; Interpolation; Photography; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D face reconstruction; B splines; Craniofacial; Curve registration; Generic elastic models; Image reconstruction","","","","","RUT; ScienceFund Malaysia, (01-01-05-SF0045); Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, HUSM, (1001/PKOMP/814109, 1001/PPSG/852004)","Funding text 1:  This research is supported by Department of Radiology Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (RUT Grant, 1001/PPSG/852004). ; Funding text 2: This research is supported by Department of Radiology Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (RUT Grant, 1001/PPSG/852004).; Funding text 3: CT head scans of patients were randomly collected from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) server at the Radiology Department, Hospital USM.

The language generated by a WKCFS is the set of all strings in the upper strands of the double-stranded strings (u, v) generated such that the strings u, v are of the same length and the corresponding symbols in the strings u, v are related by the complementarity relation.

However recognizing occluded faces remains a partially solved problem in computer vision. In this contribution we propose a novel Bayesian technique inspired by psychophysical mechanisms relevant to face recognition to address the facial occlusion problem. For some individuals certain facial regions, e.g. features comprising of some of the upper face, might be more discriminative than the rest of the features in the face. For others, it might be the features over the mid face and some of the lower face that are important. The proposed approach in this paper, will allow for such a psychophysical analysis to be factored into the recognition process. We have discovered and modeled similarity mappings that exist in facial domains by means of Bayesian Networks. The model can efficiently learn and exploit these mappings from the facial domain and hence capable of tackling uncertainties caused by occlusions. The proposed technique shows improved recognition rates over state of the art techniques. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The uniqueness of this study relies on the ability of the proteomic patterns to detect particular disease especially at the early stage. However, identification through high-throughput mass spectrometry analysis raises some challenges. Typically, it suffers from high dimensionality of data with tens of thousands attributes and high level of redundancy and noises. Hence this study will focus on two stages of mass spectrometry pipelines; firstly we propose shrinkage estimation of covariance to evaluate the discriminant characteristics among peaks of mass spectrometry data for feature extraction; secondly a sophisticated computational technique that mimic survival and natural processing which is called as Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) as feature selection is integrated with linear SVM classifier for this biomarker discovery analysis. The proposed method is tested with real-world ovarian cancer dataset to evaluate the discrimination power, accuracy, sensitivity and also specificity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","bio-inspired algorithm; classification; feature extraction; feature selection; metaheuristic; swarm algorithm","Algorithms; Classification (of information); Data processing; Diseases; Feature extraction; Intelligent systems; Mass spectrometry; Shrinkage; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Bio-inspired algorithms; Computational technique; Mass spectrometry analysis; Mass spectrometry data; Metaheuristic; Shrinkage estimations; Swarm algorithms; Biomarkers","","","","","","","Armananzas R., Saeys Y., Inza I., Garcia-Torres M., Bielza C., Van De Peer Y., Larranaga P., Peakbin selection in mass spectrometry data using a consensus approach with estimation of distribution algorithms, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, 8, 3, pp. 760-774, (2011); Celik M., Karaboga D., Koylu F., Artificial Bee Colony Data Miner (Abc-miner), pp. 96-100, (2011); Celis J.E., Gromov P., Proteomics in translational cancer research: Toward an integrated approach, Cancer Cell, 3, 1, pp. 9-15, (2003); Coombes K.R., Tsavachidis S., Morris J.S., Baggerly K.A., Hung M.C., Kuerer H.M., Improved peak detection and quantification of mass spectrometry data acquired from surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization by denoising spectra with the undecimated discrete wavelet transform, Proteomics, 5, 16, pp. 4107-4117, (2005); Efron B., Morris C., Data analysis using stein's estimator and its generalizations, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 70, 350, pp. 311-319, (1975); He Z., Yu W., Stable Feature Selection for Biomarker Discovery, (2010); James W., Stein C., Estimation with quadratic loss, Proceedings of the Fourth Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, 1, pp. 361-379, (1961); Karaboga D., An Idea Based on Honey Bee Swarm for Numerical Optimization, (2005); Karaboga D., Ozturk C., A novel clustering approach: Artificial bee colony (abc) algorithm, Applied Soft Computing, 11, 1, pp. 652-657, (2011); Ledoit O., Wolf M., Improved estimation of the covariance matrix of stock returns with an application to portfolio selection, Journal of Empirical Finance, 10, 5, pp. 603-621, (2003); Ledoit O., Wolf M., A well-conditioned estimator for large-dimensional covariance matrices, Journal of Multivariate Analysis, 88, 2, pp. 365-411, (2004); Listgarten J., Emili A., Statistical and computational methods for comparative proteomic profiling using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, Molecular & Cellular Proteomics, 4, 4, pp. 419-434, (2005); Massart D.L., Smeyers-Verbeke A.J., Practical Data Handling Visual Presentation of Data by Means of Box Plots, (2005); Mohd Shukran M.A., Chung Y.Y., Yeh W.C., Wahid N., Ahmad Zaidi A.M., Artificial bee colony based data mining algorithms for classification tasks, Modern Applied Science, 5, 4, (2011); Ressom H.W., Varghese R.S., Drake S.K., Hortin G.L., Abdel-Hamid M., Loffredo C.A., Goldman R., Peak selection from maldi-tof mass spectra using ant colony optimization, Bioinformatics, 23, 5, pp. 619-626, (2007); Sanavia T., Aiolli F., Da San Martino G., Bisognin A., Di Camillo B., Improving biomarker list stability by integration of biological knowledge in the learning process, BMC Bioinformatics, 13, SUPPL. 4, (2012); Schafer J., Strimmer K., Et al., A shrinkage approach to large-scale covariance matrix estimation and implications for functional genomics, Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology, 4, 1, (2005); SyarifahAdilah M., Abdullah R., Venkat I., Abc algorithm as feature selection for biomarker discovery in mass spectrometry analysis, 2012 4th Conference on Data Mining and Optimization (DMO), pp. 67-72, (2012); Yao J., Chang C., Salmi M., Hung Y., Loraine A., Roux S., Genome-scale cluster analysis of replicated microarrays using shrinkage correlation coefficient, BMC Bioinformatics, 9, 1, (2008); Yusoff S.A.M., Venkat I., Yusof U.K., Abdullah R., Bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms for biomarker identification in mass spectrometry analysis, International Journal of Natural Computing Research (IJNCR), 3, 2, pp. 64-85, (2012)","","","","IEEE-Seccion Espana; IEEE Systems; Man and Cybernetics - Capitulo Espanol; AEPIA; Ayuntamiento de Salamanca","8th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems, HAIS 2013","11 September 2013 through 13 September 2013","Salamanca","99721","16113349","978-364240845-8","","","English","Lect.

The input for a cellular manufacturing problem consists of a set X of m machines and a set of Y of p parts and an m × p matrix A = (aij), where aij = 1 or 0 according as the part pj is processed on the machine mi. This data can be represented as a bipartite graph G with bipartition X, Y and mi is joined to pj if aij = 1. Let G1, G2, . . ., Gk be nontrivial connected subgraphs of G such that V(G1), V(G2), . . ., V(Gk) forms a partition of V(G). Then π = {G1, G2, . . ., Gk} is called a k-cell partition of G. Any edge of G with one end in Gi and the other end in Gj with i , j represents an inter cellular movement of a part. One of the objectives in cellular manufacturing problem is to minimize the inter cellular movements of parts. Let β(G, π) denote the number of edges in G with one end in V(Gi) and other end in V(Gj). Let β(G, k) = minπβ(G, π), where the minimum is taken over all kcell partitions π of G. In this paper we propose a graph theoretic algorithm using Depth-First-Search to solve the cellular manufacturing problem for the case when k = 2. Comparison of the results that we have obtained with solutions obtained by other known algorithms shows that our algorithm gives a better solution. © 2019 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.","Bipartite graph; Cellular manufacturing problem; Depth-First-Search; Exceptional elements","Graph theory; Bipartite graphs; Cell formation problem; Cellular manufacturing problems; Connected subgraphs; Depth first search; Exceptional elements; Graph theoretic algorithm; Graph theoretic approach; Cellular manufacturing","","","","","","","Angra S., Sehgal P., Samsudeen Noori Z., Cellular manufacturing-A time-based analysis to the layout problem, International Journal of Production Economics, 112, 1, pp. 427-438, (2008); Boctor F.F., A linear formulation of the machine-part cell formation problem, International Journal of Production Research, 29, 2, pp. 343-356, (1991); Chandrasekaran M.P., Rajagopalan R., MODRoC: An extension of rank order clustering for group technology, International Journal of Production Research, 24, 5, pp. 1221-1233, (1986); Chandrasekharan M.P., Rajagopalan R., An Ideal seed Non-hierarchical Clustering Algorithm for Cellular Manufacturing, International Journal of Production Research, 24, 2, pp. 451-464, (1986); Chartrand G., Lesniak L., Graphs and Digraphs, (2005); Chen S.J., Cheng C.S., A Neural Network-based Cell Formation Algorithm in Cellular Manufacturing, International Journal of Production Research, 33, 2, pp. 293-318, (1995); Chow W.S., Hawaleshka O., An efficient algorithm for solving the machine chaining problem in cellular manufacturing, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 22, 1, pp. 95-100, (1992); Cormen T.H., Leiserson C.E., Rivest R.L., Stein C., Introduction to Algorithms, (2001); Fabrega J., Fiol M.A., On the extraconnectivity of graphs, Discrete Math, 155, pp. 49-57, (1996); Guerrero F., Lozano S., Smith K.A., Canca D., Kwok T., Manufacturing cell formation using a new self-organizing neural network, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 42, 2-4, pp. 377-382, (2002); Hong Y., Realizability of fault-tolerant graphs, Bull.

However due to low computing capacity, complicated algorithms are incompatible to be performed on the device, with sparse information further limits the feature available for extraction. Therefore, a classification method which could receive sparse input, while providing ample leverage for the classification process to accurately differentiate objects within limited computing capability is required. To achieve reliable feature extraction from a sparse LiDAR point cloud, this paper proposes a novel Clustered Extraction and Centroid Based Clustered Extraction Method (CE-CBCE) method for feature extraction followed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) object classifier. The integration of the CE-CBCE and CNN methods enable us to utilize lightweight actuated LiDAR input and provides low computing means of classification while maintaining accurate detection. Based on genuine LiDAR data, the final result shows reliable accuracy of 97% through the method proposed.","","Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Humans; Lasers; Robotics; Software; algorithm; cluster analysis; human; laser; robotics; software","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","19326203","","","34432855","English","PLoS One","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114974141"

By using Maximum Posterior Probability estimation, prior information modeled by PCA is connected to Tikhonov regularization method in order to solve the ill-posed problem of 3D face reconstruction. The prior information is learned from 3D faces of a standard 3D database. However, the optimal value of the regularization parameter λ is usually not available in advance. To overcome this problem, we restrict the distance between the reconstructed 3D face and the average 3D face close to the average of the distances between sample 3D faces and the average 3D face. This is due to the fact that the sample data are mostly located at the boundary of the data space for high dimensional and low sample size problems, which is the case for 3D faces. The optimal regularization parameter is then obtained to reconstruct the 3D face shape of a given 2D near frontal image using limited number of feature. The solution is plausible while not over-smoothing. By warping the 2D texture to the reconstructed face shape, 3D face reconstruction is achieved. Our experimental results justify the robustness of the proposed approach with respect to the reconstruction of realistic 3D face shapes from a small set of 2D facial coordinates. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","3D face reconstruction; High dimension low sample size; PCA; Tikhonov regularization","Information science; Parameterization; Problem solving; 3D face reconstruction; Maximum posterior probability; Optimal regularization; PCA; Regularization parameters; Sample sizes; Tikhonov regularization; Tikhonov regularization method; Face recognition","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This research is supported by the RUI grant: RUI# 1001/PKOMP/811290 awarded by Universiti Sains Malaysia.","Zhenqiu Z., Yuxiao H., Tianli Y., Huang T., Minimum variance estimation of 3D face shape from multi-view, 7Th International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, FGR 2006, pp. 547-552, (2006); Widanagamaachchi W.N., Dharmaratne A.T., 3D face reconstruction from 2D images, Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications, DICTA 2008, pp. 365-371, (2008); Martin D.L., Yingfeng Y., State-of-the-art of 3D facial reconstruction methods for face recognition based on a single 2D training image per person, Pattern Recogn.

Despite these challenges, gait recognition research is gaining momentum due to increasing demand and more possibilities for deployment by the surveillance industry. Therefore every research contribution which significantly improves this new biometric is a milestone. We propose a probabilistic sub-gait interpretation model to recognize gaits. A sub-gait is defined by us as part of the silhouette of a moving body. Binary silhouettes of gait video sequences form the basic input of our approach. A novel modular training scheme has been introduced in this research to efficiently learn subtle sub-gait characteristics from the gait domain. For a given gait sequence, we get useful information from the sub-gaits by identifying and exploiting intrinsic relationships using Bayesian networks. Finally, by incorporating efficient inference strategies, robust decisions are made for recognizing gaits. Our results show that the proposed model tackles well the uncertainties imposed by typical covariate factors and shows significant recognition performance. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bayesian Network; Biometrics; Gait recognition; Human motion analysis; Machine learning","Binary sequences; Biometrics; Distributed parameter networks; Gait analysis; Inference engines; Intelligent networks; Learning systems; Research; Security of data; Speech recognition; Video recording; Binary silhouettes; Covariates; Gaining momentum; Gait recognition; Gait sequences; Human motion analysis; Human motions; Interpretation model; Low resolution video sequence; Machine learning; Moving body; Recognition performance; Robust decisions; Training schemes; Video sequences; Bayesian networks","","","","","School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences; Heriot-Watt University","Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Prof. Sarkar and his team, University of South Florida for providing the gait challenge data sets.

Utilizing evacuation simulation of crowd dynamics during egress, for planning efficient crowd control can minimize crowd disaster to a great extent. Most of the previous studies on evacuation models have been done over a discrete space which have neglected the uncertainty aspect of an agent's decision making, especially when it comes to panic situations. This study proposes a model for evacuation simulation under uncertainty conditions in a continuous space via computer simulations. It will focus on developing an intelligent simulation model utilizing one of the artificial intelligence techniques which is fuzzy logic. Social Force Model will be taken as the base for basic agent motion. Membership functions such as distance from the exit, familiarity and visibility of the exit, density of crowd around the exit are incorporated in the fuzzy logic system to model the system. From our findings, it can be deduced that factors such as density, distance, and familiarity all considerably affect the time of evacuation of agents from the threat place. Indeed, uncertainty aspect influences agents' decision making, thus affecting the result of evacuation time. © 2019 IEEE.","Fuzzy Logic; Multiple Exits Evacuation Simulation; Social Force Model and Crowd Dynamics","Computer circuits; Decision making; Dynamics; Membership functions; Artificial intelligence techniques; Crowd dynamics; Evacuation management; Evacuation simulation; Evacuation simulation models; Fuzzy logic system; Intelligent simulation model; Social force models; Fuzzy logic","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","This research is funded by the FRGS 2019 Grant: FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/UIAM/02/2 awarded by the Ministry of Education Malaysia.

Compared to 2D face images, 3D face images offer more granular cues that are not available in the 2D images. However, one major setback of 3D faces is that they impose a higher dimensionality than 2D faces. In this paper, we attempt to address this problem by proposing a fully automatic 3D facial expression recognition model that tackles the high dimensionality problem in a twofold solution. First, we transform the 3D faces into the 2D plane using conformal mapping. Second, we propose a Differential Evolution (DE) based optimization algorithm to select the optimal facial feature set and the classifier parameters simultaneously. The optimal features are selected from a pool of Speed Up Robust Features (SURF) descriptors of all the prospective facial points. The proposed model yielded an average recognition accuracy of 79% using the Bosphorus database and 79.36% using the BU-3DFE database. In addition, we exploit the facial muscular movements to enhance the probability estimation (PE) of Support Vector Machine (SVM). Joint application of feature selection with the proposed enhanced PE (EPE) yielded an average recognition accuracy of 84% using the Bosphorus database and 85.81% using the BU-3DFE database, which is statistically significantly better (at p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) if compared to the individual exploit of the optimal features only. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Telecomunicación (ETSIT) Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM), Spain","In this paper, we propose a memetic based framework called Optimized Symmetric Partial Facegraphs (OSPF) to recognize faces prone to adverse conditions such as facial occlusions, expression and illumination variations. Faces are initially segmented into facial components and optimal landmarks are automatically generated by exploiting the bilateral symmetrical property of human faces. The proposed approach combines an improved harmony search algorithm and an intelligent single particle optimizer to take advantage of their global and local search capabilities. Basically, the hybridization version aids to compute the optimal landmarks. These landmarks further serve as the building blocks to intuitively construct the partial facegraphs. The efficiency of the proposed approach has been investigated in addressing the facial occlusion problem when only one exemplar face image per subject is available using comprehensive experimental validations. The proposed approach yields improved recognition rates when compared to recent state-of-the-art techniques. © 2017","Face recognition; Facial occlusion; Harmony search algorithm; Intelligent single particle optimizer; Symmetric partial facegraphs","Learning algorithms; Optimization; Automatically generated; Experimental validations; Facial occlusions; Harmony search algorithms; Illumination variation; Improved harmony search algorithms; Intelligent single particle optimizer; Symmetric partial facegraphs; Face recognition","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/ 6312153)","The authors would like to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for the partial funding of this work from the grant no. 304/PKOMP/ 6312153 .

Life-size enlargement of the face image and orientating the skull to correspond to the posture seen in the face photograph are the two main problems that exist in conventional as well as in the computer-aided craniofacial superimposition. Here we address these two potential issues by proposing a novel computer-aided approach which uses the quasi-Newton optimization method and iterative closest point algorithm. The results showed that the quasi-Newton method proposed is able to eliminate 76% and 66% of false matches, respectively, for the male and the female skull superimpositions during the initial stage of filtration. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient in assigning face photographs as inclusions (positives) and exclusions (negatives) while superimposing with related and unrelated skulls.","Forensic science;

The entries of this matrix above the main diagonal are numbers of certain subsequences, called subwords in the word w. Properties of Parikh matrices of morphic images of words under different types of morphisms have also been investigated. On the other hand, a rectangular picture array of symbols is an extension of the notion of a word to two dimensions. The concept of Parikh matrix was extended to such arrays by defining two kinds of matrices, called row and column Parikh matrices and several properties have been established. Here we introduce an array morphism, called Dejean array morphism defined on three symbols. This array morphism extends to two dimensions a word morphism due to Dejean. We derive formulae to count subwords in the rows of image arrays of rectangular binary picture arrays under Dejean array morphism, thus yielding the row Parikh matrix of the image array. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Physics; Binary picture; Image array; Morphisms; Ordered alphabets; Parikh matrix; Subwords; Two-dimension; Upper triangular matrices; Linguistics","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors thank the reviewers for their useful comments.

However, existing research overlooks diverse obstacles and assumes equal responsibility for collision avoidance among intelligent entities. To address this, we propose Fuzzy Logic Controller-Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (FLC-ORCA). Our FLC-ORCA method assigns responsibility for collision avoidance and predicts the velocity of obstacles using a LiDAR-based mobile robot. We conduct experiments in the presence of static, dynamic, and intelligent entities, recording navigation paths, time taken, angle changes, and rerouting occurrences. The results demonstrate that the proposed FLC-ORCA successfully avoids collisions among objects with different collision avoidance protocols and varying liabilities in circumventing obstacles. Comparative analysis reveals that FLC-ORCA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods such as Improved A* and Directional Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (DORCA). It reduces the overall time taken to complete navigation by 16% and achieves the shortest completion time of 1 min and 38 s, with minimal rerouting (1 occurrence) and the smallest angle change (12°). Our proposed FLC-ORCA challenges assumptions of equal responsibility and enables collision avoidance without pairwise manoeuvres. This approach significantly enhances obstacle avoidance, ensuring safer and more efficient robotic navigation for visually impaired individuals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Electronic travel aid; Fuzzy logic; Navigation aid; Obstacle avoidance; Optimal reciprocal collision avoidance","Air navigation; Collision avoidance; Computer circuits; Robots; Assign responsibilities; Collisions avoidance; Electronic travel aidss; Fuzzy logic controllers; Fuzzy-Logic; Navigation aids; Obstacles avoidance; Optimal reciprocal collision avoidance; Robotic navigation; Visually impaired; Fuzzy logic","","","","","International Islamic University Malaysia, IIUM","This research is supported by the IRAGS 2018 Grant: IRAGS18-014-0015 awarded by the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM).

In the conventional EBGM approach, facial landmarks need to be chosen manually in the initial stage and a single graph per face had been modeled. Our proposed approach intuitively fuses a Harmony search based optimization algorithm over the EBGM approach to automatically choose optimal land marks for a given face. Further, instead of using a single graph, we deploy component level sub-graphs and locate optimal landmarks by maximizing the similarity between each of the sub-graphs. Experimental results show that the proposed automatic method achieves an improved recognition rate when compared to the conventional EBGM approach. © 2014 IEEE.","Elastic bunch graph maching; Face recognition; Facial occlusion; Harmony search; Similarity measure","Pattern matching; Automatic method; Component levels; Elastic bunch graph matching; Elastic bunch graphs; Facial landmark; Facial occlusions; Harmony search; Similarity measure; Face recognition","","","","","","","Min R., Hadid A., Dugelay J., Improving the Recognition of Faces Occluded by Facial Accessories, pp. 442-447, (2011); Ekenel H.M., Stiefelhagen R., Why is Facial Occlusion A Challenging Problem, 5558, pp. 299-308, (2009); Martinez A.M., Recognizing imprecisely localized, partially occluded, and expression variant faces from a single sample per class, Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on, 24, 6, pp. 748-763, (2002); Wright J., Yang A., Ganesh A., Sastry S., Ma Y., Robust face recognition via sparse representation, Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on, 31, 2, pp. 210-227, (2009); Venkat I., Khader A.T., Subramanian K., Wilde P.D., Recognizing occluded faces by exploiting psychophysically inspired similarity maps, Pattern Recognition Letters, 34, 8, pp. 903-911, (2013); Wiskott L., Fellous J.-M., Kuiger N., Malsburg Der C.Von, Face recognition by elastic bunch graph matching, Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on, 19, 7, pp. 775-779, (1997); Bolme D.S., Thesis on Elastic Bunch Graph Matching, (2003); Geem J.H.L.G.V., Kim Z.W., A new heuristic optimization algorithm: Harmony search, Simulation, 76, pp. 60-68, (2001); Geem C.L.P.Y., Tseng Z.W., Harmony Search for Generalized Orienteering Problem: Best Touring in China, 3612, pp. 741-750, (2005); The ORL Database of Faces, Developed by AT&T Laboratories Cambridge","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2014 International Conference on Computer and Information Sciences, ICCOINS 2014","3 June 2014 through 5 June 2014","Kuala Lumpur","112912","","978-147994391-3","","","English","Int.
