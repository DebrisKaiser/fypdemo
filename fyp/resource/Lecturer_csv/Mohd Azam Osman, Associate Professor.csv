This paper introduces a mobile application which aimed to improve the information sharing and knowledge dissemination among the farming community in Malaysia. The developed system benefits the farming community by broadcasting farming related information through mobile devices, such as weather forecast, date of important farming activities, and advices on the use of pesticides and fertilizers. However, not all kind of communication technology or channel is practical as the current infrastructure might not support the new technology or the prospective users might not afford price of the technology. Thus the matching between the target users and the appropriate level of technology to be provided is vitally important in order for the technology to be actually utilized. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore the current communication infrastructure of the rice farming community in Malaysia, in order to identify the potential of applying new information and communication methods in the agricultural community. The findings of this study indicate that Short Message Service (SMS) is the most cost effective and practical method to disseminate information to the farming community at this point of time. However, if other communication channels such as Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and mobile Internet become widely supported by the target users' devices, they have great potential to replace the SMS method.","Agriculture technology; Communication; Information technology; Mobile technology","Agriculture; Communication; Cost effectiveness; Developing countries; Information technology; Message passing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Personal communication systems; Telemedicine; Text messaging; Weather forecasting; Agriculture technology; Communication infrastructure; Communication technologies; Information and communication; Information and Communication Technologies; Knowledge dissemination; Mobile Technology; Multimedia messaging service; Information dissemination","","","","","","","Man N., Sadiya I., Off-Farm Employment Participation Among Paddy Farmers In The Muda Agricultural Development Authority and Kemasin Semerak Granary Areas of Malaysia, Asia-Pacific Development Journal, 16, 2, pp. 141-153, (2009); Grimshaw D.J., Kala S., Strengthening Rural Livelihoods: The Impacts of Information and Communication Technologies in Asia, (2011); Biljon J.V., Kotz P., Modelling the factors that influence mobile phone adoption, (2007); May H., Hearn G., The mobile phone as media, International Journal of Cultural Studies, 8, pp. 195-211, (2005); Featuring the Handphone Users Survey, 3, (2007); Wang M., Possible adoption of precision agriculture for developing countries at the threshold of the new millennium, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 30, 1-3, pp. 45-50, (2001); Agarwal R., Prasad J., The role of innovation characteristics and perceived voluntariness in the acceptance of information technologies, Decision Sciences, 28, 3, pp. 557-582, (1997); Plouffe C.R., Hulland J., Vandenbosch M., Research Report: Richness Versus Parsimony in Modeling Technology Adoption Decisions-Understanding Merchant Adoption of a Smart Card-Based Payment System, Information Systems Research, 12, 2, pp. 208-222, (2001); Guo X.L.X., Xu Y., Yuan J., Yu X., Explaining the Mobile Health Services Acceptance from Different Age Groups: A Protection Motivation Theory Perspective, International Journal of Advancements in Computing Technology (IJACT), 4, 3, pp. 1-9, (2012); Compeau D.R., Higgins C.A., Computer self-efficacy: Development of a measure and initial test, MIS Quarterly, 19, pp. 189-212, (1995); Alafeef M., Singh D., Ahmad K., Influence of Demographic Factors on the Adoption Level of Mobile Banking Applications in Jordan, Journal of Convergence Information Technology(JCIT), 6, 12, pp. 107-113, (2011); Manstead A.S., Eekelen S.A.V., Distinguishing Between Perceived Behavioral Control and Self-Efficacy in the Domain of Academic Achievement Intentions and Behaviors, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 28, 15, pp. 1375-1392, (1998); Wang C., Fang R., Park K., Feng Y., Lu Z., Chui Y., Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Security and Adoption of Mobile Government: An Empirical Research, Advances in Information Sciences and Service Sciences (AISS), 4, 6, pp. 234-244, (2012)","W.

However, the need for such systems goes further than just the need to convert a scanned document into a text file. There is also a need to produce a more appealing and refine reconstructed fonts. Recently, many research works in font reconstruction have shown successful and encouraging results. However, the usual way of evaluating the performance of font reconstruction is through visual inspection which is very subjective in nature, and arduous for a more perfect and objective evaluation. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to present a framework for an objective performance evaluation method that can be used to compare a reconstructed font with its original counterpart. Thus, it will involve studying the nature of the current and existing digital fonts and then formulate a method to compare character glyph of the created font with its corresponding original font. From this framework, it is expected that font reconstruction would be made more refine and the evaluation can be made more objective and less arduous than using the human eye, and old and rare documents can be more readily available for users in digital format with better precision in particular on tablets and other resource-constrained devices. © 2016 IEEE.","character classification; digital font reconstruction; optical character recognition","Character recognition; Optical character recognition; Character classification; Digital format; Human eye; Objective evaluation; Optical character recognition (OCR); Resourceconstrained devices; Text file; Visual inspection; Digital devices","","","","","","","Cutter M.P., Van Beusekom J., Shafait F., Breuel T.M., Unsupervised font reconstruction based on token co-occurrence, Proceedings of the 10th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering DocEng'10, pp. 143-150, (2010); Cutter M.P., Van Beusekom J., Shafait F., Breuel T.M., Font group identification using reconstructed fonts, DRR of SPIE Proceedings, SPIE, 7874, pp. 1-10, (2011); Open Source Document Analysis and Ocr System; Better Pdf Ocr.

The use of video cameras to capture motion images instead of static images poses a great challenge to researchers in terms of speed and accuracy of the object tracking and detection. In this paper, fish are used in the experiment due to its active swimming behaviour which emulates the movement of many living objects such as humans or animals. The main problem faced in the tracking process is that the fishes swim in various directions and angles. It is difficult to track and identify a specific fish in a school of fish in most cases. Besides, the fish may also appear to be overlapping one another. There exists several object tracking systems in the market but the focuses are mainly on surveillance. Besides, there is still room for improvement in the tracking process. Therefore, this paper focuses on using an additional camera for tracking fish in real-time environment. The evaluation of the tracking process consists of using the same video with an additional camera positioned above the fish tank. Results show improvement when an additional camera is used to obtain additional information mainly the trajectory patterns of the fish which contributes to bringing a higher accuracy of the tracking system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Dual camera; Fish tracking; Object tracking; Single camera","Cameras; Information science; Tracking (position); Video cameras; Dual cameras; Object Tracking; Real-time environment; Research domains; Single cameras; Swimming behaviours; Tracking process; Trajectory pattern; Fish","","","","","","","Jia-Hong L., Mei-Yi W., Zhi-Cheng G., A tank fish recognition and tracking system using computer vision techniques, International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology (ICCSIT), 4, pp. 528-532, (2010); Shao L., Xie G., Real-time tracking of moving objects on a water surface, International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA), pp. 2114-2119, (2012); Chew B.F., Eng H.L., Thida M., Vision-based real-time monitoring on the behavior of fish school, IAPR Conference on Machine Vision Applications, pp. 90-93, (2009); Wong P.L., Osman M.A., Talib A.Z., Yahya K., Modelling of fish swimming patterns using an enhanced object tracking algorithm, Frontiers in Computer Education, 133, pp. 585-592, (2012); Wong P.L., Osman M.A., Talib A., Yahya K., Tracking multiple fishes using colour changes identification and enhanced object tracking algorithm, Appl.

It provides numerous kinds of ecosystem services that are of great benefit to humankind. However, to the general public, knowledge on the importance of mangrove ecosystems is very limited. In this paper, we present our experience in establishing the Mangrove Reference Data Center (MRDC) and its augmented reality-based mobile application called Kilim Scouter which provides information details of mangrove plants and related information to the users. MRDC is a data center that stores information details of mangrove plants in Kilim Geoforest Park in Langkawi Island, Malaysia such as common and scientific names of species, as well as its distribution (GPS location). In addition, MRDC also stores other information for example other inhabitants of the ecosystem and non-living entities such as Karstic hills and caves found in the Mangrove ecosystem. MRDC comes with a web application that acts as an interface to MRDC for accessing, adding or modifying the information details of mangrove plants. Kilim Scouter is a mobile application which deploys Augmented Reality (AR) technology, a technology through which the view of the real world environment is augmented by adding computer-generated elements/objects. Kilim Scouter utilizes the AR technology to automatically track and identify the mangrove plants and its related information, and then provides the information by retrieving data from MRDC. MRDC and Kilim Scouter are capable of providing on-the-go accessibility of information details of mangrove plants and target users such as tourists and researchers. This application will create awareness on the importance of the mangrove ecosystems and thus, assist the effort in sustaining the mangrove ecosystem. © 2018 Authors.","Augmented reality; Data centre; Mangroves","","","","","","","","Zhang D., Lan Z., Wang Q., Wang X., Zhang W., Li Z., The evaluation of the mangrove ecosystem services value change in Zhangjiang River estuary based on remote sensing, Proceedings of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), Barcelona, 1, 12, pp. 2302-2305, (2007); Rabbi I., Ullah S., A Survey on augmented reality challenges and tracking, Acta Graphica, 24, 1-2, pp. 29-46, (2013); Malaysia Mangrove, Malaysia Mangrove, (2011); ""Mangroves and Their World,"", (2014); Kalkofen D., Sandor C., White S., Schmalstieg D., Visualization techniques for augmented reality, Handbook of Augmented Reality, pp. 65-98, (2011); Neumann U., You S., Cho Y., Lee J., Park J., Augmented Reality Tracking in Natural Environments,, International Symposium on Mixed Realities, (1999); Milsap G., Bourland E., Advanced rendering for augmented reality on mobile devices, Rensselaer; Huang J.-H., Mishra S., A sensor based tracking system using witnesses, 25th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, USA, pp. 251-255, (2005); Klopschitz M., Schall G., Schmalstieg D., Reitmayr G., Visual tracking for augmented reality, International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), Zurich, pp. 1-4, (2010); Min S., Mei L., Feizhou Z., Zhipeng W., Daozheng W., Hybrid tracking for augmented reality GIS registration, Japan-China Joint Workshop on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology (FCST 2007), pp. 139-145, (2007); GPS Status & Toolbox","M.A. Osman; School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, Pulau Pinang, 11800, Malaysia; email: azam@usm.my","","Science Publishing Corporation Inc","","","","","","2227524X","","","","English","Int.

In attempting to enhance the accessibility of these resources, it is necessary to cater the needs of the users as well as provide search outcomes which are closer to the request. Recently, researchers converted the search path in DRO search from the data retrieval (DR) approach to the information retrieval (IR) approach. Various DRO retrieval systems have been built to facilitate the process of accessing the DRO contents. Thus, such systems need to evaluate their performance effectivity. This paper presents the characteristics of the collections that should be made available in the DRO test collections. It also reviews the computational evaluations and statistical tests used to evaluate the performance of the DRO retrievals. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Digital resource objects; Evaluations; Statistical tests; Test collections","Industrial engineering; Computational evaluation; Data retrieval; Digital resources; Rapid growth; Retrieval systems; Test Collection; Engineering","","","","","","","Witten I.H., Bainbridge D., Paynter G., Boddie S., Importing Documents and Metadata into Digital Libraries: Requirements Analysis and an Extensible Architecture, pp. 390-405, (2002); Wang J., Massive information management system of digital library based on deep learning algorithm in the background of big data, Behav.

The importance of deep learning lies in the localisation and classification of an object based on frames. This study focuses on fish recognition methods in underwater videos and addresses the underlying challenges of these methods. It is important to develop effective methods to recognise fish and their movements using underwater videos. From a practical and scientific perspective, this is extremely useful to automatically recognise fish through their movement and to monitor and collect biomass in marine bodies. More importantly, it allows researchers to collect and analyse information related to the health and well-being of the Marine ecosystem. As most of the current methods work on static images, the issue arises when these methods are applied to images from videos. The existing multiple fish detection methods for underwater videos have a low detection rate due to the inherent underwater conditions such as the presence of coral reefs and other challenges which include the different sizes, shapes, colour, and speed of fish as well as marine behaviours such as the overlapping of fish. Therefore, the use of improved methods based on the latest deep learning algorithms has been proposed for multiple fish detection. This paper provides a novel framework for fish instance segmentation in underwater videos. The proposed model for improved recognition methods is composed of four main stages: 1) pre-processing method to reduce external factors in the videos for better detection and recognition of fish in underwater videos, 2) use of deep learning approach for enhanced detection of fish using RESENT, 3) enhanced detection of multiple fish based on the Region Proposal Network (RPN) architecture, and 4) use of a dynamic instance segmentation method. The results of this study indicate that the proposed framework has a better performance capability than other state-of-the-art models for multi-fish instance segmentation. © 2020","Deep learning; Fish detection; Instance segmentation","Anthozoa; automation; biomass; breakthrough curve; coral reef; machine learning; recognition; segmentation; underwater vehicle; videography","","","","","","","Abadi M., Agarwal A., Barham P., Brevdo E., Chen Z., Citro C., Corrado G.S., Davis A., Dean J., Devin M., Et al., Tensorflow: large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous distributed systems, arXiv, (2016); Aljarrah I.A., Ghorab A.S., Khater I.M., Object recognition system using template matching based on signature and principal component analysis, Int.

In this paper, the recognition of fish based on GCFD (Generalized Color Fourier Descriptor) is introduced. The features are extracted using the GCFD technique which represents the image in a frequency domain. By analyzing the frequencies, the non-related information (backgrounds, not required lines or borders) are identified by performing some spectrum changes on the frequencies. The required objects in this study are the fish. In other words, the frequencies corresponding to the fish are maintained while other frequencies are removed from the frequency domain. After removing the non-related frequencies, the frequency domain is inversed in order to obtain the required image for further image processing. GCFD is used as a descriptor to extract the features of the fish as it is invariant to rotation and translation. A cultured fish tank installed with high-end video cameras is required to record the video from side and top views. Koi fish are chosen due to their active swimming behavior, variety of colors and easy-to-adapt habitat in the water. The evaluation of the technique is based on Bhattacharyya Distance. Some improvements were obtained in the recognition rate using the GCFD compared with existing color descriptors. The improvement can lead to better classifications of objects. © 2015 IEEE.","Feature Extraction; Fourier Descriptor; Object Recognition","Color; Feature extraction; Fish; Fourier transforms; Frequency domain analysis; Object recognition; Video cameras; Bhattacharyya distance; Color descriptors; Descriptors; Fish tank; Fourier descriptors; Frequency domains; Swimming behavior; Top views; Image processing","","","","","","","Wong P.L., Osman M.A., Talib A.Z., Yahya K., Tracking multiple fish in a single tank using an improved particle filter, Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, 279, pp. 799-880, (2013); Wong P.L., Osman M.A., Talib A.Z., Yahya K., Tracking multiple fish using colour changes identification and enhanced object tracking algorithm, Applied Mechanics and Materials, 284-287, pp. 1528-1532, (2013); Isard M., Blake A., Condensation-conditional density propagation for visual tracking, International Journal of Computer Vision, 29, 1, pp. 5-28, (1998); Koller-Meier E., Ade F., Tracking multiple objects using the condensation algorithm, Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 34, pp. 93-105, (2001); Wong P.L., Osman M.A., Talib A.Z., Yahya K., Modelling of fish swimming patterns using an enhanced object tracking algorithm, 3CA 2011: 3rd International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation (3CA 2011), (2011); Ciocca G., Cusano C., Gasparini F., Schettini R., Self-adaptive image cropping for small displays, Consumer Electronics, ICCE 2007.

Many methods have been used to track fishes by integrating microchips in fishes, using infra-red cameras, image processing and motion sensor. The use of particle filter in the process of tracking has been widely used by researchers. Particle filters is used to track people, fluid movement and animals. In this paper, the particle filter algorithm is improved to track multiple fish in a fish tank. The aim is to identify every fish trajectories and fish target location for further analysis. The main challenge is to ensure that the correct fish are tracked and the algorithm manages to identify specific fish even if they overlaps with each another. The objective of the study is to improve the existing particle filter to track multiple fish in a single fish tank. The improved algorithm contains an additional cache which stores the object's position to estimate the next potential move of the fish. The result is evaluated by comparing existing algorithm without the enhancement with the improved algorithm. Besides, suggestions in improving the particle filter will also be discussed in this paper. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","fish tracking; particle filter; tracking system","Algorithms; Computer science; Distributed computer systems; Image processing; Monte Carlo methods; Signal filtering and prediction; Tanks (containers); Target tracking; Fluid movement; Improved particle filter; Infra-red cameras; Motion sensors; Particle filter; Particle filter algorithms; Target location; Tracking system; Fish","","","","","","","Wong P.L., Osman M.A., Talib A.Z., Yahya K., Modelling of fish swimming patterns using an enhanced object tracking algorithm, Frontiers in Computer Education, pp. 585-592, (2012); Muizz W.A., Osman M.A., Talib A.Z., Yahya K., Framework for modelling of fish behaviour through fish swimming patterns, Ocean &Coastal Observation: Sensors and Systems (OCOSS 2010).

The tool or method used in this scenario is known as pull-technology. As a solution, this study proposed an online shopping widget which automatically retrieves relevant online shopping information from various sources at single point of time based on the concept of push technology. In relevant to this, the objective of this paper is to investigate the acceptance level of the proposed online shopping widget among Malaysians, through applying technology acceptance theory in questionnaire survey. The findings of this study imply that the overall acceptance level of alaysians toward the proposed online shopping widget is considered as relatively low. In addition, the result of this study also suggested that perceived usefulness of the sidebar widget is the strongest antecedent which led to the intention of use of the online shopping widget. This study has provided a foundation to both practitioners (e.g. software developers) and academicians for understanding of the acceptance level of similar push technology-based online shopping widget, and the characteristics the online shopping widget (especially usefulness and ease-of-use) should incorporated in order to enhance acceptance level among prospective users.","Online shopping; Push technology; Sidebar widget; Technology acceptance theory","","","","","","","","E-payments Gaining Popularity, (2008); Pastore M., Online Consumer Spending Growth Slowing, (2000); Watabe K., Iwasaki K., Factors Affecting Consumer Decisions About Purchases At Online Shops and Stores, (2007); Agarwal R., Prasad J., Are individual differences germane to the acceptance of new technologies?, Decision Sciences, 30, pp. 361-391, (1999); Edison S.W., Geisller G.L., Measuring attitudes towards general technology: Antecedents, hypotheses and scale development, Journal of Targeting, Measurement and Analysis For Marketing, 12, pp. 137-156, (2003); Kenneth W., What is Push Technology?, California Research Bureau Note, 4, pp. 1-18, (1997); Push Technology Take Your Mobile Experience to the Next Level, Featured Articles April 2006, 4, pp. 51-53, (2006); Davis F.D., User acceptance of information technology: System characteristics, user perceptions and behavioral impacts, International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 38, pp. 475-487, (1993); Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 13, pp. 319-339, (1989); Stem B.B., Et al., Consumer acceptance of online auctions: An extension and revision of the TAM, Psychology and Marketing, 25, pp. 619-636, (2008); Pang C., Ji X., An Empirical Study On Predicting User Purchase Intention On the Creative Product: A Case of Apparel, (2008); Compeau D.R., Higgins C.A., Computer self-efficacy: Development of a measure and initial test, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 19, pp. 189-210, (1995); Scott C.A., Yalch R.F., Consumer response to initial product trial: A Bayesian analysis, Journal of Consumer Research, 7, pp. 32-41, (1980); Yang K.C.C., Exploring factors affecting the adoption of mobile commerce in Singapore, Telematics And Informatics, 22, pp. 257-277, (2005); Krishnan G., Internet Marketing Exposure In Malaysia, (2006); Gliem J.A., Gliem R.R., Calculating, Interpreting, And Reporting Cronbach's Alpha Reliability Coefficient For Likert-Type Scales, Midwest Research-to-Practice Conference in Adult, Continuing And Community Education, (2003); Montgomery D.C., Et al., Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis, (2001)","L.

Nonetheless, existing system to manage the complaint reports often has the problem of insufficient and ambiguous description about the reported infrastructure which resulting difficulties for the management to take action. The troublesome process of filing a complaint report could have reduced the willingness of public to make a report. Therefore, this paper is to introduce solution to the situation through an infrastructure damage complaining system with location awareness and photo capturing capabilities. The proposed system has been developed and thus the purpose of this paper is to introduce the system from the perspective of system design and architecture and to discuss the practical implications of the system. The proposed system provides an instant and convenient approach for the public to file a complaint report about damaged or faulty infrastructure. The public only need to take a photo with their mobile device and the system will automatically embed the coordination of the facility into the photo with geo-tagging technique. The simplified process of filing a complaint report may encourage the public to be more willing to collaborate with management. The visual information in the photo and location of the facility provide useful for the management team to accurately assess the severity of the damage thus to be able take informed action. As the outcome, the proposed system helps to achieve more effective and efficient management of public infrastructure. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Geo-tagging; Information engineering; Location awareness; Mobile application","Computer applications; Innovation; Ambiguous description; Damaged infrastructure; Efficient managements; Existing systems; Geo-tagging; Information engineerings; Location awareness; Management team; Mobile applications; Public infrastructures; Reporting systems; Visual information; Mobile devices","","","","","","","Pagani M., Determinants of Adoption of Third Generation Mobile Multimedia Services, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 18, 3, pp. 46-59, (2004); de Reuver M., Haaker T., Designing Viable business Models for Context-aware Mobile Services, Telematics and Informatics, 26, 3, pp. 240-248, (2009); Featuring the Handphone Users Survey, (2007); Rouvinen P., Diffusion of Digital Mobile Telephony: Are Developing Countries Different?, Telecommunications Policy, 30, 1, pp. 46-63, (2006); Kobben A.B., Muthukrishnan K., Wireless Campus Lbs: Building Campus-Wide Location Based Services Based on Wifi Technology, Geographic Hypermedia, pp. 399-408, (2006); Wen L., Nee C., Cun K., Shiang-Yen T., Idrus R., Development of Handheld Directory System built on WiFi-based Positing Techniques, International Journal of Computers and Communications, 5, 3, (2011)","T.

Part of the errors is due to mistakes in the medical record or incomplete medical record which may trigger tragic consequences. In this paper, we present an application that manages securely personal health information on a mobile platform and keeps all the medical records of a patient in digital format. Patients are able to access their medical record at their convenience and the confidentiality of information is guaranteed. Patients are also able to share their personal health record with their respective doctor in a secure way. The application consists of several modules: incognito, access control, privacy control, authentication, encryption, multifactor authentication and emergency control. An anonymous database is created by removing all the identifier of a patient before the health record is stored in the database. This provides an extra layer of protection to the patient’s privacy. In particular, our proposed application introduces the multifactor authentication and emergency control modules which provides a multi-layered defense authentication and emergency case handler respectively. Thus, the proposed application allows the patient to assess their records conveniently and securely, and helps them in emergency situations. As such, the application is suitable for cases involving large number of patients and emergency situations such as in Hajj healthcare management. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","","Access control; Cryptography; Health; Medical problems; Public health; Emergency control; Emergency situation; Health-care managements; Mobile platform; Multi-factor authentication; Personal health informations; Personal health record; Privacy control; Authentication","","","","","School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia","We would like to acknowledge the contribution of the School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia and the support of the Long-Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS), 203.PTS.6728004 from the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education.","Alwan A., Global Status Report on Non-Communicable Diseases, (2010); World Confederation for Physical Therapy, (2010); Gaffar H.D., Achmadi U.F., Syamsu I.P., Hajj health management focussing on the risk factor management, Int.

The tool or method used in this scenario is known as pull-technology. As a solution, this study proposed an online shopping widget which automatically retrieves relevant online information from various sources at single point of time based on the concept of push technology. Hence, the objective of this paper is to investigate the acceptance level of the proposed online shopping widget among Malaysian, through applying technology acceptance theory in questionnaire survey method. The findings of this study imply that the overall acceptance level of Malaysian toward the proposed online shopping widget is considered as low. In addition, the result of this study also suggested that perceived usefulness of the sidebar widget is the strongest antecedent which lead to the intention of use of the online shopping widget. This study has provided a foundation to both practitioners (e.g. software developers) and academicians for understanding of the acceptance level of similar push technology-based online shopping widget, and the characteristics the online shopping widget should incorporated in order to enhance acceptance level among prospective users.","Online shopping; Push technology; Sidebar widget; Technology acceptance theory","Electronic commerce; Surveys; Malaysians; New product; On-line information; Online shopping; Perceived usefulness; Prospective buyers; Push technology; Questionnaire surveys; Sidebar widget; Single point; Software developer; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance theory; Web-page; Technology","","","","","","","E-payments Gaining Popularity, (2008); Watabe K., Iwasaki K., Factors Affecting Consumer Decisions About Purchases at Online Shops and Stores, (2007); Agarwal R., Prasad J., Are individual differences germane to the acceptance of new technologies?, Decision Sciences, 30, 2, pp. 361-391, (1999); Edison S.W., Geisller G.L., Measuring attitudes towards general technology: Antecedents, hypotheses and scale development, Journal of Targeting, Measurement and Analysis for Marketing, 12, 2, pp. 137-156, (2003); Kenneth W., What is push technology?, California Research Bureau Note, 4, 6, pp. 1-18, (1997); Push Technology Take Your Mobile Experience to the Next Level, 4, 4, pp. 51-53, (2006); Davis F.D., User acceptance of information technology: System characteristics, user perceptions and behavioral impacts, International Journal of Man-machine Studies, 38, 3, pp. 475-487, (1993); Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 13, 3, pp. 319-339, (1989); Stem B.B., Et al., Consumer acceptance of online auctions: An extension and revision of the TAM, Psychology and Marketing, 25, 7, pp. 619-636, (2008); Pang C., Ji X., An Empirical Study on Predicting User Purchase Intention on the Creative Product: A Case of Apparel, (2008); Compeau D.R., Higgins C.A., Computer self-efficacy: Development of a measure and initial test, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 19, 2, pp. 189-210, (1995); Scott C.A., Yalch R.F., Consumer response to initial product trial: A Bayesian analysis, Journal of Consumer Research, 7, pp. 32-41, (1980); Yang K.C.C., Exploring factors affecting the adoption of mobile commerce in Singapore, Telematics and Informatics, 22, 3, pp. 257-277, (2005); Krishnan G., Internet Marketing Exposure in Malaysia, (2006)","L.

In order to increase the retrieval effectiveness of DRO, adding extra information to its contents is required. However, the extra information must be related to the structure of DRO. Each document contains metadata units with multiple topics. Document expansion (DE) methods utilize the unstructured documents to increase the document contents. In the same way, in this paper, an Enhanced Document Expansion (EDE) method is proposed by utilizing structured documents. DE method is a way of feeding and providing documents with new information to increase the effectiveness of the documents. Usually, traditional DE methods add terms to the original documents. In the proposed EDE method, a new procedure to increase the information content according to specific steps is added and aimed at adding new information which is more relevant and closer to each metadata unit in each document.

However, the tradition is becoming less and less popular nowadays due to the proliferation of new media entertainment. In this paper, we present the architecture of a software tool that allows people to experience shadow puppet play in the virtual world. Normally, a virtual puppet show is controlled automatically by the application. However, our tool allows the user to create storyline and control the puppets directly in real-time. This paper focuses in detail on the design and issues of two of the main components of an interactive virtual shadow puppet play which are the intelligent instructional tool for puppeteering and interactive virtual shadow puppet play animation. The result of the evaluation has shown that the tool is able to help users more beneficially and a higher degree of satisfaction among the respondents which include professional puppeteers and potential general users.

Unfortunately, existing mHealth apps continue to have accuracy issues and limited number of disease detection systems. Thus, an intelligent disease diagnostics system may help medical staff as well as people in poor communities in rural areas. This study proposes a scheme for simultaneously selecting the best neural network models for intelligent disease detection systems on mobile devices. To find the best models for a given dataset, the proposed scheme employs neural network models capable of evolving altered neural network architectures. Eight neural network models are developed simultaneously and then implemented on the android studio platform. Mobile health applications use pre-trained neural network models to provide users with disease prediction results. The performance of the mobile application is measured against the existing available datasets. The trained neural network engines perform admirably, detecting 7 out of 8 diseases with high accuracy ranging from 86% to 100% and a low detection accuracy of 63%. The detection times vary from 0.01 to 0.057 seconds. The developed mHealth app may be used by health workers and patients to improve resource-poor community health services and patients' healthcare quality. © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

In recent years, various approaches of robot communication have been proposed and implemented on human-robot interaction. This paper introduces a framework design for robot intelligent interaction and teleoperation using multilayer-cross control communication. The framework's approach is using wireless environment with multiple communications which are used across heterogeneous type of devices and networks connections. This approach is applied using widely-used devices such as PC, PDA, Smartphone, or other computer-based devices in order to communicate with the robot and other component in the framework. The existing communication tools in those devices, such as Wireless LAN and Bluetooth, are utilized. In this approach, a computer acts as a middleware device that can be used to extend and expand the network capability and interaction distance between robot and human operator. © 2010 University Sains Malaysia.","human-robot interaction; master-slave; network communication; robotic; teleoperation robot","Communication; Distributed computer systems; Equipment; Human computer interaction; Intelligent robots; Machine design; Man machine systems; Middleware; Multilayers; Remote control; Communication method; Communication tools; Computer-based devices; Control communications; Human operator; Interaction distances; Master-slave; Network capability; network communication; Robot communication; Robot intelligent; Smart phones; teleoperation robot; Wireless environment; Wireless LAN; Human robot interaction","","","","","","","Luo R.C., Hsu T.Yi., Su K.L., The development of a multisensor based intelligent security robot: Chung Cheng #1, Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics, ICM '05, 2005, pp. 970-975, (2005); Gupta G.S., Mukhopadhyay S.C., Messom C.H., Demidenko S., Master-slave control of a teleoperated anthropomorphic robotic arm with gripping force sensing, Conference Record - IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference, 3, pp. 2203-2208, (2005); Tang H., Cao X., Song A., Guo Y., Bao J., Human-robot collaborative Teleoperation system for semi-autonomous reconnaissance robot, International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA '09), pp. 1934-1939, (2009); Shiomi M., Sakamoto D., Kanda T., Ishi C.T., Ishiguro H., Hagita N., A semi-autonomous communication robot: A field trial at a train station,  ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human Robot Interaction, (2008); Inagaki Y., Sugie H., Aisu H., Ono S., Unemi T., Behavior-based intention inference for intelligent robots cooperating with human, Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy System, pp. 1695-1700, (1995); Li Y.Y., Fan W.H., Liu Y.H., Cai X.P., Teleoperation of robots via the mobile communication networks, 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics, ROBIO, 2005, pp. 670-675, (2005); Lego Mindstorms NXT Communication Protocol, (2006); Baek B.H., Li V., Kim S.H., Lee G.K., Choi Y.S., Lightweight middleware for robot, IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN), pp. 279-284, (2007); Sziebig G., Gaudia A., Korondi P., Ando N., Solvang B., Robot vision for RT-middleware framework, IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (IMTC), pp. 1-6, (2007); Park J.H., Kim K.O., Jeon J.W., PDA based user interface management system for remote control robots, 2006 SICE-ICASE International Joint Conference, pp. 417-420, (2006); Graefenstein J., Bouzouraa M.E., Robust method for outdoor localization of a mobile robot using received signal strength in low power wireless networks, IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 33-38, (2008); Arkin R.C., Intelligent mobile robots in the workplace: Leaving the guide behind,  International Conference on Industrial and Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems (IEA/AIE), pp. 553-561, (1988); Koller A., Kruijff G.M., Talking robots with LEGO Mindstorms,  International Conference on Computational Linguistics, (2004)","A.

The problem is that each document contains a large number of metadata units. These units are located in a single document describing different topics. Therefore, retrieving the entire document means retrieving all these units which may be mostly irrelevant to the user‘s query. The Dirichlet smoothing model usually calculates the probability of having the query in each document and then displays the related documents basedon the query.It is therefore best to retrieve the nearest and relevant metadata units for the query regardless of which document they belong to.To achieve this, astructured Dirichlet smoothing model is proposed in this paper thatcalculates the likelihood between the query and the metadata units instead of between the query and the whole document. The experiments which were conducted on the cultural heritage CHiC2013 collectionhave shown a statistically significant improvement over the traditional Dirichlet smoothing model. © BEIESP.","Digital resource objects;

Different concepts have been taken such as installing water sensors and video cameras to identify movement speed, colours, shapes and swimming patterns displayed by the fishes. In this research, an enhanced algorithm consisting of motion detection algorithm and condensation algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is further integrated with colour changes identification technique which considers the changes in colour on fishes. This is to identify overlapping fishes and to detect the distance between the camera and the fishes in the water. In our case study, a cultured fish tank installed with water sensors to monitor water pH, dissolved oxygen and temperature is set up together with two network cameras. Koi fishes are chosen due to their active swimming behaviour, variety of colours and easy-to-adapt habitat in the water. A real-time prototype system which models the fish swimming pattern consisting of the enhanced algorithm and the colour changes identification is developed. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Colour changes identification; Condensation algorithm; Fish tracking; Motion detection","Algorithms; Biochemical oxygen demand; Color; Condensation; Innovation; Research; Sensors; Colour change; Condensation algorithm; Fish swimming; Fish tank; Identification techniques; Motion detection; Movement speed; Network cameras; Object tracking algorithm; Prototype system; Swimming behaviours; Swimming patterns; Water sensors; Fish","","","","","","","Jing T., How-Lung E., Stochastic multiple fish tracking using motion and shape consistency, Consumer Electronics (ISCE), IEEE 15th International Symposium on, (2011); Muizz W.A., Osman M.A., Talib A.Z., Yahya K., Framework for Modelling Fish Behaviour Through Fish Swimming Pattern, (2010); Wong P.L., Osman M.A., Talib A.Z., Yahya K., Modelling of Fish Swimming Patterns Using an Enhanced Object Tracking Algorithm, 3rd International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation (3CA 2011), (2011); Information on Motion Detection Algorithms; Meier E.B., Ade F., Tracking cars in range images using the CONDENSATION algorithm, "" Intelligent Transportation Systems, 1999.

The authorities publish notices on the notice boards and sent patrolling car to each agriculture areas to broadcast farming scheduling information to farmers using mobile loud speaker. Besides, farmers rely on weather forecast information from local television channels, and newspapers to plan their farming activities. The inability of getting instant access to information which is crucial to farming has posed the farmers to greater vulnerability of their livelihoods. Currently, farmers are not exposed to ICT integrated application which can help them to manage their daily farming activities and provide accurate weather forecast. Therefore, GreenEve2Peace that uses a modern way of information dissemination by utilizing mobile technology is introduced for the farming community. The approach is design to provide timely information on paddy planting activities, pest and disease control, weather forecast service and allow two way communications among the farmers and the authorities via the Short Message Service (SMS) and online portal. In this paper, we relate our experience in deploying the approach for farming community in a selected area in Malaysia. The approach manage to improve farmers' livelihood by providing them better access to information, enhance their human capital, strengthen the connectivity among farmers and the authority, and saves cost and time. The problems in this study included farmers acceptance level towards ICT integration in agriculture and to identify a sustainable business model to deliver the service without relying on governmental support. © 2012 Infonomics Society.","agriculture management; farming community; mobile technology; short messaging services","Information dissemination; Information science; Information technology; Message passing; Telecommunication equipment; Weather forecasting; Agriculture management; Agriculture sectors; Farming activities; farming community; Human capitals; Integrated applications; IS design; Malaysia; Mobile Technology; Scheduling information; Short message services; Short messaging service; Sustainable business; Television channel; Two way communications; Weather forecast services; Weather forecasts; Agriculture","","","","","","","Grimshaw D.J., Kala S., Strengthening Rural Livelihoods: The Impacts of Information and Communication Technologies in Asia, (2011); (2011); (2010); Tey Y.S., Darham S., Noh A.M., Idris N., Acreage Response of Rice: A Case Study in Malaysia, (2009); Information Book of Ministry of Agriculture 2010, (2010); Man N., Sadiya I., Off-Farm Employment Participation among Paddy Farmers in the Muda Agricultural Development Authority and Kemasin Semerak Granary Areas of Malaysia, Asia-Pacific Development Journal, 16, 2, pp. 141-153, (2009); MHealth for Development: The Opportunity of Mobile Technology for Healthcare in the Developing World, (2009); Passport GMID, (2011); Digital Media Across Asia, (2010); Shaffril H.M., Hassan M.S., Hassan M.A., D'Silva J.L., Agro-Based Industry, Mobile Phone and Youth: A Recipe for Success, European Journal of Scientific Research, 36, 1, pp. 41-48, (2009); Nigel S., Batchelor S., Ridley J., Jorgensen B., The Impact of Mobile Phone for Africa, (2004); Osman M.A., Talib A.Z., Sabudin M., Wong P.L., GreenEve2Peace: An Advising and Scheduling Management Platform for Farming Community, 10th WSEAS International Conference on Software Engineering, Parallel and Distributed Systems (SEPADS'11), pp. 90-95, (2011); Wong P.L., Osman M.A., Sabudin M., Sulaiman S., An Experience on Introducing A Mobile Community Platform: Flying2U.

This is because even though the 4G network technologies such as IEEE 802.16m and LTE-A is capable of providing 4G performance, the benefits that these technologies extol will not trickle down to the mobile nodes (MN) involved if the network selection method is inefficient. High speed MNs will be a feature of 4G networks as these networks are capable of supporting MNs that move at a speed of up to 250km/hr. Therefore, a network selection mechanism that takes into account MN's mobility scenario is absolutely necessary. Network communication environment that is heterogeneous, whereby MNs with multiple interfaces can connect to is also becoming the norm. This means network selection method that can provide personalized Always Best Connected (ABC) is vital in maximizing the potential of heterogeneous candidate networks (CN) in fulfilling user's needs.

This paper describes a method to model a virtual shadow puppet play using sophisticated computer graphics techniques available in Adobe Flash in order to allow interactive play in real-time environment as well as producing realistic animation. Areal-time method is proposed to produce the shadow image that allows interactive play of the virtual shadow puppets by using texture mapping and blending techniques. Special effects such as lighting and blurring effects for virtual shadow puppet play environment are also proposed. Moreover, the use of geometric transformations and hierarchical modeling facilitates interaction among the different parts of the puppet during animation. In essence, our methods and techniques have overcome various limitations of the existing works in virtual shadow puppet play. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Animation; Blending; Interactive Play; Real-Time; Shadow Puppet Play; Virtual Storytelling; Visual Simulation","Animation; Blending; Mathematical transformations; Interactive Play; Real-Time; Shadow Puppet Play; Virtual storytelling; Visual simulation; Interactive computer graphics","","","","","","","Matusky P., Malaysian Shadow Play and Music: Continuity of An Oral Tradition, (1993); Edward V.N., Javanese Wayang Kulit: An Introduction, (1980); Salij H.J., Shadow Play and Other Stories, (1982); Liu J., Chinese Shadow Puppet Plays, (1998); David C., Shadow Puppets & Shadow Play, (2008); Silva A., Vala M., Paiva A.C.R., Papous: The virtual storyteller, IVA 2001.

Instance segmentation is a critical issue that requires further improvement due to the difficulties in adapting object detection and instance segmentation approaches. This paper presents an approach that overcome these issues by proposing a new approach based on the recent DL approach in addition to developing an approach for multi-object instance segmentation. The improved multi-object segmentation approach presented in this paper consists of three stages. Firstly, it improves the RestNet-101 (Residual Neural Network) backbone by connecting it to the convolution layer for each ResNet block. Secondly, the localization of multiple objects is improved by enhancing the Region Proposal Network (RPN), and thirdly, a complex instance segmentation approach is utilized. The result of this study based on a standard dataset, called the Common Object in Context (COCO) dataset, reveals that the suggested approach compared to other well-known segmentation approaches, has improved the instance segmentation process in terms of precision and training time. © 2022 University of Kuwait.

Nowadays, many organisations aim to make these resources available to users. Basically, Dirichlet smoothing (DS) model is widely used to retrieve DRO documents. DS model uses a smoothing parameter μ which plays a strong role in finding the value of the unseen terms to avoid zero probability value. For documents of equal length, the value of μ is set as a constant value although its value depends on the length of a document. In DROs, almost all documents are of different length, and each metadata unit in a document also has a different length. Hence, it is not appropriate to predefine the μ parameter with a constant value and uses it for different search space. This leads to difficulty in accessing and retrieving the DRO documents. To solve fixed smoothing-parameter value problem in DRO’s retrieval, and make DROs more accessible, Adaptive Dirichlet Smoothing (ADS) and Adaptive Structured Dirichlet Smoothing (ASDS) models are proposed to improve the performance of the DRO’s retrieval by estimating the smoothing parameter automatically. The proposed ASDS model comprises the ADS model together with an existing DS model. Experimental results on CHiC2013 collections show that the proposed models have the ability to retrieve the most relevant results (documents or metadata units) related to a particular query and reduce the zero-probability values compared with state-of-the-art traditional methods particularly on DROs. Moreover, t-test result is used to prove that the performance of the proposed models is statistically significant. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Digital resource objects;

One of the main causes is the failure to manage a journey. Vehicles tend to choose the shortest paths which ended up congesting a certain area. If a journey is well managed, using alternative paths may lead to the same destination in a shorter period of time. Therefore, with the importance of sustainable environment, intelligent route planning system has become a popular research agenda among researchers and industries. In this paper, an enhanced algorithm based on A*-search algorithm is proposed. The enhanced algorithm is used to study the traffic congestion level as well as to suggest the best route to a destination. The algorithm takes the traffic congestion level into consideration, which makes choosing the best route possible in minimal travel time. © 2009 IEEE.","","Learning algorithms; Routing algorithms; Traffic surveys; Alternative path; Research agenda; Route planning system; Search Algorithms; Shortest path; Sustainable environment; Travel time; Traffic congestion","","","","","","","National Transportation Studies; Heavy Traffic Bad For Your Heart, BBC News, (2004); Keiichi U., Hideki S., Tooru N., Genetic Algorithms for Vehicle Routing Problem in Delivery System, Vehicle Navigation & Information Systems Conference Proceedings, (1994); Ryan L., Sushil J.L., Chris M., Using A Genetic Algorithm To Explore A*-Like Path Finding Algorithms; Traffic Congestion; Kenneth A.B., Paul J.L., Algorithms: Sequential, Parallel and Distributed, Thomson Course Technology, (2005); A* Search Algorithm","W.

This paper presents a mobile-based method for mangrove species identification called multi-layer mangrove species identification method (MSIA) and its application for Kilim Geo-forest Park, in Langkawi, Malaysia. This work involves formulating the identification method, the design and development of the mobile application, and its integration with the Mangrove Reference Data Centre. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface to support visitors with limited knowledge on the mangrove tree species. One of the main features of MSIA is the automatic identification of the mangrove tree species based on its leaf which enhances the performance of species identification. Firstly, the mangrove tree leaf is captured using the mobile phone camera. Next, the first layer in the identification method is carried out to identify the leaf shape. Once the species has been identified, additional parameters such as types of tree root, tree bark, flower or fruit will be entered in the second layer of the identification process. A specific mangrove species common name and its related information such as biological information and possible medicinal or commercial worth of the species will then be displayed. This paper presents the design and implementation of MSIA as well as the testing and the evaluation of the method and its application. It is believed that MSIA would make a visit to the mangrove park more meaningful and enjoying to the visitors. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Artificial intelligence; Image processing; Mangrove species; Multi-Layer identification","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Image processing; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Plants (botany); Automatic identification; Biological information; Design and Development; Design and implementations; Identification process; Mangrove species; Species identification; User friendly interface; Forestry","","","","","","","Langkawi Mangrove Biodiversity Database, (2009); Kumar N., Belhumeur P.N., Biswas A., Jacobs D.W., Kress W.J., Lopez I.C., Soares J.V.B., Leafsnap: A computer vision system for automatic plant species identification, ECCV 2012, Part II.

The associated heavier workloads together with tension and pressure often lead to stress-related health problems. People do really deserve a good rest when they come home from their office. As a result, the proposed solution-The Eye 2H is an intelligent system that will use the technique of image processing and face recognition to detect and analyze the human emotion to control the electronic equipment in their house through an intelligent control box. There are several studies highlighted that by controlling the brightness of light, we could affect the emotion or behavior of humans. Thus, we believe that The Eye 2H is capable to fulfill the main objective of the project which is to provide a better living environment for people in order to provide them a harmony and happy (2H) living life. The Eye 2H is capable of boosting the mood and emotion of the residents by controlling the electronic equipment in their house.

People travel for business, study, vacation, religious activity and many more. Nonetheless, while travelling, their safety and health condition can be a major concern to travelers as well as concern from their family members. There exists many existing smart traveler app for the purpose of locating a traveler. However, they might produce accurate location. Predicting location in all apps is largely based on the speed of a walking traveler. This paper discusses the techniques for more accurate location tracking and location prediction of a traveler. The techniques are able to track the movement of the traveler using location tracking techniques and predict the location of a missing traveler based on parameters such as walking speed, age, gender, weather condition and the health condition. The results based on an app developed in this research show that the techniques are more accurate and efficient. Also, with these techniques, a better emergency alert system can be incorporated in a smart traveler app. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Location based tracking; Location prediction; People tracking; Smart traveler app","Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Tracking (position); Accurate location; Emergency alert system; Health condition; Location based tracking; Location prediction; People tracking; Safety and healths; Tracking techniques; Location","","","","","","","Reidenberg J.R., Gellman R., Debelak J., Elewa A., Liu N., Privacy and Missing Persons after Natural Disasters, (2013); Munich Attack: Teenage Gunman Kills Nine People at Shopping Centre, (2016); Hajj Pilgrimage: More than 700 Dead in Crush near Mecca, (2015); Louisiana Faces Ongoing Flood Danger as Obama Declares Federal Disaster Zone, (2016); Wang S., Min J., Yi B.K., Location based services for mobiles: Technologies and standards, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communication (ICC 2008), pp. 35-38, (2008); Steiniger S., Neun M., Edwardes A., Foundations of Location Based Services-Lecture Notes, (2006); Zahradnik F., Wi-Fi Positioning System, (2016); Fitzpatrick K., Brewer M.A., Turner S., Another look at pedestrian walking speed, Transp.

Computer-aided SLI diagnosis has been proposed to counter these inconveniences. This study focuses on evaluating the feasibility of computer systems used to diagnose SLI. Methods: The accuracy of Webgazer.js for software-based gaze tracking is tested under different lighting conditions. Predefined time delays of a prototype diagnosis task automation script are contrasted against with manual delays based on human time estimation to understand how automation influences diagnosis accuracy. SLI diagnosis binary classifier was built and tested based on randomised parameters. The obtained results were cross-compared to Singlims_ES.exe for equality. Results: Webgazer.js achieved an average accuracy of 88.755% under global lighting conditions, 61.379% under low lighting conditions and 52.7% under face-focused lighting conditions. The diagnosis task automation script found to execute with actual time delays with a deviation percentage no more than 0.04%, while manually executing time delays based on human time estimation resulted in a deviation percentage of not more than 3.37%. One-tailed test probability value produced by both the newly built classifier and Singlims_ES were observed to be similar up to three decimal places. Conclusion: The results obtained should serve as a foundation for further evaluation of computer tools to help speech language pathologists diagnose SLI. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.","Automation; Diagnosis; Specific language impairment","Article; automation; classification algorithm; classifier; computer model; decision making; diagnostic accuracy; expert system; feasibility study; gaze; human; illumination; language disability; linear regression analysis; mathematical parameters; mobile application; one tailed test; probability; questionnaire; speech language pathologist","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This study was supported by the short-term grant (304/PHUMANITI/6315349) from Universiti Sains Malaysia.","Specific language impairment [Internet], (2017); Farnsworth B., Eye tracker prices — an overview of 20+ eye trackers, (2019); Weismer ES., Developmental language disorders: challenges and implications of cross-group comparisons, Folia Phoniatr Logop, 65, 2, pp. 68-77, (2013); Hosozawa M, Tanaka K, Shimizu T, Nakano T, Kitazawa S., How children with specific language impairment view social situations: an eye tracking study, Pediatrics, 129, 6, pp. e1453-e1460, (2012); Papoutsaki A, Sangkloy P, Laskey J, Daskalova N, Huang J, Hays J., WebGazer: scalable webcam eye tracking using user interactions, Proceedings of the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence — IJCAI 2016, pp. 3839-3845, (2016); Patrick W., Dynamic heatmaps for the web, (2014); Crawford JR, Garthwaite PH., Investigation of the single case in neuropsychology: confidence limits on the abnormality of test scores and test score differences, Neuropsychologia, 40, pp. 1196-1208, (2002)","C.Y.

However, not all kind of technologies are practical as the current infrastructure might not support the new technology or the prospective users might not afford price of the technology. Thus the matching between the target users and the appropriate level of technology to be provided is vitally important in order for the technology to be actually utilized. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore the current communication infrastructure of the rice farming community in Malaysia, in order to identify the potential of applying new information and communication methods in the agricultural community. The findings of this study indicate that Short Message Service (SMS) is the most cost effective and practical method to disseminate information to the farming community at this point of time. However, if other communication channels such as Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and mobile Internet become widely supported by the target users' devices, they have great potential to replace the SMS method. © 2012 AICIT.","argriculture technology; communication; Information Technology; mobile technology; rice farming","Agriculture; Communication; Developing countries; Information dissemination; Information management; Communication infrastructure; Communication problems; Cost effective; Information and communication; Information and Communication Technologies; Malaysia; Mobile Internet; Mobile Technology; Multimedia messaging service; Practical method; rice farming; Short message services; Information technology","","","","","","","Man N., Sadiya I., Off-Farm Employment Participation among Paddy Farmers in the Muda Agricultural Development Authority and Kemasin Semerak Granary Areas of Malaysia, Asia-Pacific Development Journal, 16, 2, pp. 141-153, (2009); Grimshaw D.J., Kala S., Strengthening Rural Livelihoods: The Impacts of Information and Communication Technologies in Asia, (2011); V Biljon J., Kotz P., Modelling the factors that influence mobile phone adoption, Proceedings of the 2007 Annual Research Conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists on IT Research in Developing Countries, Port Elizabeth, South Africa, 2007; May H., Hearn G., The mobile phone as media, International Journal of Cultural Studies, 8, pp. 195-211, (2005); Featuring the Handphone Users Survey, 3, (2007); Wang M., Possible adoption of precision agriculture for developing countries at the threshold of the new millennium, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 30, 1-3, pp. 45-50, (2001); Agarwal R., Prasad J., The role of innovation characteristics and perceived voluntariness in the acceptance of information technologies, Decision SCiences, 28, 3, pp. 557-582, (1997); Plouffe C.R., Hulland J., Vandenbosch M., Research Report: Richness Versus Parsimony in Modeling Technology Adoption Decisions -Understanding Merchant Adoption of a Smart Card-Based Payment System, Information Systems Research, 12, 2, pp. 208-222, (2001); Compeau D.R., Higgins C.A., Computer self-efficacy: Development of a measure and initial test, MIS Quarterly, 19, pp. 189-212, (1995); Manstead A.S., Van Eekelen S.A., Distinguishing between Perceived Behavioral Control and Self-Efficacy in the Domain of Academic Achievement Intentions and Behaviors, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 28, 15, pp. 1375-1392, (1998)","T.

The consumers' side of the study enables better understanding of the demands and consumers' preferences in the mobile content market. On the other hand, looking into the providers in Malaysia allows the identification of business model adopted, challenges and future trend in the market. This study takes two approaches in looking into the research problem. Selfadministrated survey is adopted in the demand side investigation which involves end-consumers, whereas qualitative interview is deployed in the supplier side investigation which involves providers of mobile contents. The findings of this study could assist the practitioner especially mobile content developers to understand the market in Malaysia, and enable them to serve their customers better. Additionally, the preliminary findings in this study can be the starting points for future empirical research that rigorously examines the mobile content market.","Market analysis; Mobile application; Mobile content; Mobile phone","Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Business models; Demand and supply; Demand-side; Empirical research; Future trends; Malaysia; Market analysis; Mobile applications; Mobile content; Qualitative interviews; Research problems; Commerce","","","","","","","Kuang E., (2009); Mobile In Asia 2011, (2011); Global ICT Developments, (2011); Featuring the Handphone Users Survey Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, (2007); Biljon J.V., Kotz P., Modelling the Factors That Influence Mobile Phone Adoption, Proceedings of the 2007 annual research conference of the South African institute of computer scientists and information technologists on IT research in developing countries, pp. 152-161, (2007); Wilska T.-A., Mobile Phone Use as Part of Young People's Consumption Styles, Journal of Consumer Policy, 26, 4, pp. 441-463, (2003); Yang K.C.C., Exploring Factors Affecting the Adoption of Mobile Commerce in Singapore, Telematics and Informatics, 22, 3, pp. 257-277, (2005); Pagani M., Determinants of Adoption of Third Generation Mobile Multimedia Services, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 18, 3, pp. 46-59, (2004); Rouvinen P., Diffusion of Digital Mobile Telephony: Are Developing Countries Different?, Telecommunications Policy, 30, 1, pp. 46-63, (2006); Wang Y.-S., Lin H.-H., Luarn P., Predicting Consumer Intention to Use Mobile Service, Information Systems Journal, 16, 2, pp. 157-179, (2006); Silverman D., Text and Interaction, (1993); Jung Y., Perez-Mira B., Wiley-Patton S., Consumer adoption of mobile TV: Examining Psychological Flow and Media Content, Computers In Human Behavior, 25, 1, pp. 123-129, (2009); Comber C., Colley A., Hargreaves D.J., Et al., The Effects of Age, Gender and Computer Experience upon Computer Attitudes, Educational Research, 39, 2, pp. 123-133, (1997); Women In a Wireless Word, (2011); de Reuver M., Haaker T., Designing Viable business Models for Context-aware Mobile Services, Telematics and Informatics, 26, 3, pp. 240-248, (2009); Nassereslami F., Saghafi F., Safety Technologies Impacts Survey in M-services Security Provision, International Journal of Digital Content Technology and Its Applications (JDCTA), 4, 4, pp. 207-214, (2010); Lee C.-C., Hsieh M.-C., Huang H.-C., The Influence of Mobile Self-efficacy on Attitude towards Mobile Advertising, Advances In Information Sciences and Service Sciences (AISS), 3, 3, pp. 100-108, (2011); Ho S.Y., Bull S., Users' Trust and Intention to Adopt Personalized Mobile Services, Journal of Next Generation Information Technology, 2, 1, (2011); Yugay O., Semyonov A., Ko F., Et al., Analysis and Implementation of M-commerce in Education for Developing Countries (Uzbekistan case), Journal of Convergence Information Technology (JCIT), 2, 3, pp. 77-88, (2007); Gavalas D., Bellavista P., Cao J., Et al., Mobile Applications: Status and Trends, Journal of Systems and Software, 84, 11, pp. 1823-1826, (2011); Holzer A., Ondrus J., Mobile Application Market: A Developer's Perspective, Telematics and Informatics, 28, 1, pp. 22-31, (2011); Mallat N., Rossi M., Tuunainen V.K., Et al., The Impact of Use Context on Mobile Services Acceptance: The Case of Mobile Ticketing, Journal of Information & Management, 46, 3, pp. 190-195, (2009)","T.

These lead to decrease in the performance of the DRO retrieval. With a view to increase the performance of the DRO retrieval, many components of information retrieval have been enhanced such as document expansion (DE), retrieval model such as Dirichlet smoothing (DS) model, and query expansion (QE). Most of these studies have shown that employing IR components (DE, QE or DS) independently to enhance the DROs retrieval has helped to increase the performance of the retrieval. It is assumed that IR components can enhance the performance of the DRO retrieval. Based on this assumption, an information retrieval framework (IRF) for DROs is presented in this paper. The proposed IRF is to address the retrieval problems in DROs and provide an environment for retrieving information from DROs with the highest possible performance. The principle task of IRF is to make all components of IR (DE, DS, and QE) work together to achieve the greatest benefit in improving the retrieval performance. Several experiments were conducted on CHiC2013 which is a collection on cultural heritage. The results show a considerable enhancement over other IR approaches that use the DE method, DS model and QE method independently. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Different metadata standards exist for describing various types of digital objects. Several researches have reported on how to address issues related to accessing of metadata resources. Most studies on metadata involve cultural heritage domain, and this is an indication of the importance of this domain in metadata research and development. Research on metadata in cultural heritage mainly revolves around three fundamental issues: (1) lack of quality in metadata contents in most of the cases, (2) difficulty in accessing metadata contents due largely to limited user’s knowledge on the content of the metadata, and (3) heterogeneity of the data at the level of schemas which makes the access even more difficult. The lack of quality in metadata makes it difficult for the users to retrieve and explore information that satisfies their needs. So, in order to make its contents more accessible, enhancing the metadata content is required, especially for cultural heritage collections which consist of digital objects (structured documents) described by a variety of metadata schemas. This paper presents issues and challenges in enhancing access to metadata by reviewing the existing approaches in metadata environment with a particular emphasis on cultural heritage collections. In this paper, firstly, we look at the classification of metadata which is divided into two categories namely data retrieval and information retrieval. Then, we present the analysis, findings and suggestions on how to address issues in enhancing access to metadata contents especially in cultural heritage collections. A detailed comparison is given between information retrieval and data retrieval, and it focuses on the applicability of one approach over the other. A framework that aims to improve the effectiveness of retrieval when searching metadata is also proposed and tested. The proposed framework consists of approaches and methods that are expected to enhance access to metadata especially in cultural heritage collections and be useful for those with limited knowledge on cultural heritage. The experiments were conducted on CHiC2013 which is a collection on cultural heritage. The results show a considerable enhancement over other IR approaches that use the expansion methods. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Cultural heritage; Data retrieval; Information retrieval; Metadata","Classification (of information); Information retrieval; Cultural heritage collections; Cultural heritages; Data retrieval; Issues and challenges; Metadata environment; Metadata Standards; Research and development; Structured document; Metadata","","","","","","","Abd Manaf Z., The state of digitization initiatives by cultural institutions Malaysia.
