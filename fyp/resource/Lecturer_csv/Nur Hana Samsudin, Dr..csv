This is to show whether there is any difference in pronouncing these two types of spelling form in Malay. It is also important to know that Malay is a non-tonal language. Thus, this study will not be affected by semantic of a word. This comparison is important to determine whether it is necessary to have a parameter to represent different prominence in pronunciation between these two situations in our unit selection speech corpus. © 2005 IEEE.","Glides formation / insertion; Orthographic form; Phonological form; Speech synthesis; Unit selection","Biomedical engineering; Signal processing; Glides formation / insertion; Non-tonal languages; Orthographic form; Phonological form; Speech corpora; Unit selection; Speech synthesis","","","","","","","Huang X., Acero A., Won H.-W., Spoken language processing: A guide to theory, algorithm and system development, Pearson Publication: New Jersey, (2001); Campbell W.N., Labelling an english speech database for prosody control, Proceeding ASJ, Spring, 1-P-8, (1992); Campbell W.N., CHATR: A high-definition speech re-sequencing system, Proceedings 3rd ASA/ASJ Joint Meeting, pp. 1223-1228, (1996); Campbell W.N., Processing a speech corpus for CHATR synthesis, Proceedings of the International Conference on Speech Processing 1997, pp. 183-186, (1997); Beutnagel M., Conkie A., Schroeter J., Styliano Y., Syrdal A., The AT&T Next-gen TTS system, 137th Proceedings of the Joint Meeting of ASA, EAA, and DAGA, Berlin, (1999); Conkie A., Robust unit selection system for speech synthesis, Joint Meeting of ASA/EAA/DAGA, (1999); TTS Interactive Demo (AT&T Labs Research); CHATR (generic speech synthesis system), ATR Interpreting Telecommunication Research Labs; Kassim T.A., The Phonological Word in Standard Malay, (2000); Dahaman I., Pedoman ejaan dan sebutan bahasa melayu, Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, (1996)","N.-H.

For virtually every nation in the world, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, previously experienced by the people of China alone, has now become a matter of great concern. This research highlights its impact on the global economy, in addition to the immediate health consequences associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. The study further discussed the use of Text Analytics and Sentiment Analysis in Natural Language Processing (NLP) based on Twitter text to analyse public sentiment and derive insights regarding Covid-19 vaccines in the healthcare domain. Two machine learning algorithms were employed: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to classify and evaluate the results. Various pre-processing techniques were adopted to help in detecting the public sentiment based on the three sentiment polarity classes: positive, negative, and neutral. The result of the sentiment class distribution reveals that 31% of the public sentiment regarding Covid-19 vaccines is positive, 22% is negative while the remaining 47% were classified as neutral sentiment. The experimented machine learning algorithms reveals that SVM produced 88% accuracy which surpasses KNN with 78% accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.","Covid-19; Covid-19 Vaccines; Sentiment Analysis; Text Analytics; Twitter","Learning algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Coronaviruses; Covid-19; Covid-19 vaccine; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning approaches; Nearest-neighbour; Public sentiments; Sentiment analysis; Support vectors machine; Text analytics; Vaccines","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9)","This research is supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under the project code, FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9 with title “Automated Big Data Annotation for Training Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Model in Sentiment Classification”.","Statista Inforgraphic: Social Data Reportal Hootsuite; Global Digital Population, (2020); Sun S., Luo C., Chen J., A review of natural language processing techniques for opinion mining systems, Inf.

Heteronym is a homograph words which the meaning and the pronunciation differ according to the semantic of the sentence. There is only 12 unique heteronym in Malay. However, these words can be expanded depending on the morphology of the sentence. Malay language is also very rich with prefix and suffixes. Thus, one word can be expanded either to two unique words or more. For the list of 12 unique pair of words, we can expand the list to 98 unique words. Thus, there are greater variation possibility of enunciating a heteronym words.

The research also aims to determine the influencing factors of DevOps practices’ acceptance and adoption in software organizations, determine gaps in the software development literature, and introduce a clear picture of current technology acceptance and adoption research in the software industry. A comprehensive literature review clarifies how users accept and adopt new technologies and what leads to adopting DevOps practices in the software industry as the starting point for developing a conceptual framework for adopting DevOps in software organizations. The literature results have formulated the conceptual framework for adopting DevOps practices. The resulting model is expected to improve understanding of software organizations’ acceptance and adoption of DevOps practices. The research hypotheses must be tested to validate the model.

Many programmers are actively contributing to this platform and discuss about Python programming language. To better study the topics related to Python questions posted on the platform, a text analytics approach incorporating text preprocessing steps and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling algorithm is proposed. The two main objectives of this study are: to discover and compare the topics of the questions about Python programming language posted on SO from 2008 to 2016, and to analyze questions about Python programming language with high votes posted on SO from 2008 to 2016 using topic modelling technique with a suitable number of topics. From the study, we find that the topics of the Python questions posted on Stack Overflow have gradually shifted towards those related to data modelling and analysis from 2008 to 2016. Furthermore, the study also shows that a suitable number of topics using the topic modelling technique yield a high coherence score concerning the topic model in use, which is important to extract more meaningful topics from the collection of Python questions. © 2021.

It is widely used in many organizations nowadays and becoming more popular because it changes the way of how the Information Technology (IT) of an organization is organized and managed. It provides lots of benefits such as simplicity and lower costs, almost unlimited storage, least maintenance, easy utilization, backup and recovery, continuous availability, quality of service, automated software integration, scalability, flexibility and reliability, easy access to information, elasticity, quick deployment and lower barrier to entry. While there is increasing use of cloud computing service in this new era, the security issues of the cloud computing become a challenges. Cloud computing must be safe and secure enough to ensure the privacy of the users. This paper firstly lists out the architecture of the cloud computing, then discuss the most common security issues of using cloud and some solutions to the security issues since security is one of the most critical aspect in cloud computing due to the sensitivity of user's data. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Digital storage; Engineering research; Quality of service; Software reliability; Cloud computing services; Internet based computing; Security issues; Software integration; Third parties; Cloud computing","","","","","","","Armbrust M., Fox A., Griffith R., Joseph A.D., Katz R., Konwinski A., Lee G., Patterson D., Rabkin A., Stoica I., Zaharia M., A View of Cloud Computing, Communications of the ACM Magazine, 53, pp. 50-58, (2010); Ashraf I., An overview of service model of cloud computing, Int.

Our approach involves three main steps: language clustering, grapheme to phoneme mapping and prosody modelling. We have tested the mapping of phonemes from German to English and from Indonesian to Spanish. We have also constructed three prosody representations for different language characteristics. For evaluation we have developed an English TTS based on German data, and a Spanish TTS based on Indonesian data and compared their performance against pre-existing monolingual TTSs.

Industry 4.0 calls for transformation and effective talent development is vital in ensuring national aspirations are achieved while eliminating redundancy and ensuring consistency. As such, this study aims to understand the impact of Industry 4.0 on computer engineering-related workforce and skills development within Multinational Companies (MNCs) to Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. In this study, online questionnaires were distributed to evaluate the current and future hiring trends. The study reveals that most of the employees have positive perceptions about the industrial current practice on Industry 4.0 and identified the prospective demands on the professions that will be affected. Five significant areas of required competencies found in this study are adaptability, soft skills, software engineering, data analytics, and technical skills. The findings provide empirical evidence about current and future employment scenarios in Malaysia concerning the possible impact of Industry 4.0 on the companies and issues involved in managing the transition to Industry 4.0. Besides, the emergent skills required by workforces that are previously unaddressed in the literature were identified. Empirical evidence from the analysis contributes to shaping the educational systems of the future and helps to proactively identify specific skills shortages at an early stage. © The Author(s) 2022.","future talents;

Techniques of fake news stories detection ingenious, varied, and exciting. This study aims to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analytics and train deep learning models for detecting fake news based on news title or news content. Solution proposed in this study aims to be applied in real-world social media and eliminate the bad experience for user to receive misleading stories that come from non-reputable source. For NLP techniques, text preprocessing such as regular expression, tokenization, lemmatization and stop words removal are used before vectorizing them into N-gram vectors or sequence vectors using terms frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) or one-hot encoding respectively. Then, TensorFlow is chosen as the framework to be used with built in Keras deep learning libraries that is having a large community and number of commits on Tensorflow GitHub repository that can be enough to build deep learning neural network models. Results from the models are showing that models trained with news content can achieve better performance with computation time being sacrificed while models trained with news title require less computation time to achieve good performance. Also, overall performance of models fed with N-gram vectors are slightly better than models fed with sequence vectors. © 2020 IEEE.","deep learning; Fake news; Keras; natural language processing; neural network; TensorFlow","Computational linguistics; Industrial electronics; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); State assignment; Text processing; User experience; Vectors; Computation time; Inverse Document Frequency; Learning models; Learning neural networks; NAtural language processing; Nlp techniques; Regular expressions; Text preprocessing; Deep learning","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9, PKOMP6711634)","This research is supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE) under the project code, FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9 (PKOMP6711634) with title “Automated Big Data Annotation for Training Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Model in Sentiment Classification”.","Hassan N.H., New Straits Times; Vasandani J., Towards Data Science, (2019); Asr F.T., Taboada M., Big Data and Quality Data for Fake News and Misinformation Detection, (2019); (2017); (2019); Exploratory Data Analysis, (2012); Badr W., TowardsDataScience; Singhal S., Jena M., A study on WEKA tool for data preprocessing, classification and clustering, International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE), 2, 6, pp. 250-253, (2013); Martin J.H., Regular Expressions, Text Normalization, Edit Distance, (2018); Vijayarani S., Ilamathi J., Nithya, Preprocessing techniques for text mining-An overview, International Journal of Computer Science & Communication Networks, 5, 1, pp. 7-16, (2015); Ozbay F.A., Alatas B., Fake news detection within online social media using supervised artificial intelligence algorithms, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 540, pp. 1-17, (2020); Poddar K., Comparison of various machine learning models for accurate detection of fake news, Innovations in Power and Advanced Computing Technology (I-PACT), (2019); Brownlee J., Machine Learning Mastery, (2016); Brownlee J., Machine Learning Mastery, (2018)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","10th IEEE Symposium on Computer Applications and Industrial Electronics, ISCAIE 2020","18 April 2020 through 19 April 2020","Virtual","160764","","978-172815033-8","","","English","ISCAIE - IEEE Symp.

However, if the adaptation is not implemented carefully, the foreignness of the sound will be too noticeable for the listeners. This paper presents the analysis of respondents’ acceptance of a series of listening tests. The research goal was to find out in the absence of phonemes of a particular language, would it be possible for the phonemes to be replaced with another language’s phonemes. This will be especially beneficial for under-resourced language either in the case for 1) the language has not yet well researched into or 2) the language has not well documented in the required media. Preliminary studies were conducted to construct phoneme confusion matrices. The confusion study was observed based on the consonants’ position in syllable structure: onset and coda. These studies were then compared to similar studies to find possible overlap among them. Then, based on the outcome, two perceptual tests have been conducted to observe the applicability of phoneme substitutions. The first test was to observe the effect of phonemes substitution during the intelligibility test for individual words. The second test was to evaluate whether context influenced perception based on whether respondents noticed phoneme substitution on a word in a series of words. From these experiments, it can be concluded that it is possible to do phoneme substitution but with a certain condition. From significance testing, it was found that phoneme substitution may not be suitable to be implemented for onset position but can be applied for coda position provided the context is available. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

This paper also address language identification framework however with data has been downsized considerably from general language identification architecture. The system goal is to identify the type of language being spoken to the system based on a series of trained speech with sound file features and without any language text data or lexical knowledge of the spoken language. The system is also expected to be able to be deployed in mobile platform in future. This paper is specifically about measuring the performance optimisation of audio filters on a CNN model integration for the language identification system. There are several metric to gauge the performance identification system for a classification problem. Precision, recall and F1 Scores is presented for the performance evaluation with different combination of filters together with CNN model as the framework of the language identification system. The goal is not to get the best filter for noise, instead to identify the filter that is a good fit to develop language model with environmental noise for a robust language identification system. Our experiments manage to identify the best combination of filters to increase the accuracy of language identification using short speech. This resulting us to modify our pre-processing phase in the overall language identification system. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.
