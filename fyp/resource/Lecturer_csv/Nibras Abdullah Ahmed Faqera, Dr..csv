WMS involves several responsibilities, such as collection, disposal, and utilization of waste in relevant facilities. Efficient waste management has a considerable impact on the quality of life of citizens in smart cities. The interaction between wireless sensor networks and mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) with IoT provides excellent mobility for users, and reduces the deployment costs of networks. Data transfer via the intermediate connected devices must be maintained to shorten the distance between the devices. Intelligent routing algorithm is proposed to find efficient paths that comply with the WMS requirement constraints and avoid invalid paths that cause increased computation time. Chromosome intersection operation on genetic-based routing algorithm, intersection activation function, and intersection node table are proposed to avoid the similarity and redundancy of generated paths and keep the validity of the paths. This study improves the path finding, obtains good results, and increases the rate of efficient paths. Results show that the selected path is efficient in terms of distance, number of hops and number of iterations by using the proposed method. In addition, this proposed method outperforms DSR, which offers alternative paths with more efficiency. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

However, the open nature of the communication network medium that is used by VANETs exposes the messages in transit to security attacks and the information within to privacy breaches. Researchers proposed many security schemes in their attempt to solve the security and privacy issues in VANETs. However, most existing schemes suffer from high computation and communication overheads. We studied and analyzed the effect of one of the most common security attacks in VANETs, the replay attack. This paper presents the result of the study and analysis, as well as the survey of existing replay attack prevention schemes in VANETs. © 2020 IEEE.","Authentication; Replay attack; Security; Vehicular ad hoc network","Network security; Signal processing; Communication overheads; Privacy breaches; Security and privacy issues; Security attacks; Self-organizing wireless; Traffic management; Traffic-related; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Al-Shareeda M.A., Anbar M., Manickam S., Yassin A.A., Vppcs: Vanet-based privacy-preserving communication scheme, IEEE Access, pp. 1-1, (2020); Al-Shareeda M.A., Anbar M., Hasbullah I.H., Manickam S., Hanshi S.M., Efficient conditional privacy preservation with mutual authentication in vehicular ad hoc networks, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 144957-144968, (2020); Mahmood Al-Shareeda A M.A.A.S.M., Anbar M., Security schemes based conditional privacy-preserving in vehicular ad hoc networks, Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 21, 1, (2020); Al Shareeda M., Khalil A., Fahs W., Realistic heterogeneous genetic-based rsu placement solution for v2i networks, International Arab Journal of Information Technology, 16, 3 A, pp. 540-547, (2019); Mostafa A., Vanet blockchain: A general framework for detecting malicious vehicles, J.

This article proposes a cyber-intrusion detecting system classification with MLP trained by a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm and feature selection based on multi-objective wrapper method. The classifier, named as HADMLP is trained using a hybridization of the artificial bee colony along with the dragonfly algorithm. A multi-objective artificial bee colony model which is wrapper-based is used for selection of feature. Hence, collective name of the proposed technique referred as MO-HADMLP. For performance evaluation, the proposed method was assessed using ISCX 2012 and KDD CUP 99 datasets. The results of our experiments indicate a significant enhancement to the efficacy of network intrusion detection when compared to other approaches. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial Bee Colony (ABC); Dragonfly Algorithm (DA); Intrusion Detecting System (IDS); Multi-objective Optimization (MO); Multilayer Perceptron (MLP); Selection of Feature (SoF)","Computer crime; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Neural networks; Optimization; Artificial bee colonies; Hybrid metaheuristic algorithms; Multi objective; Multi-objective artificial bee colonies; Network intrusion detection; Neural network classification; Security and protection; Wrapper methods; Network security","","","","","","","Raman M.R.G., Somu N., Kirthivasan K., Liscano R., Shanka Sriram V.S., An efficient intrusion detection system based on hypergraph-Genetic algorithm for parameter optimization and feature selection in support vector machine, Knowl.-Based Syst., 134, 1-12, (2017); Mohammadi S., Mirvaziri H., Ghazizadeh-Ahsaee M., Karimipour H., Cyber intrusion detection by combined feature selection algorithm, J.

Devices with significant computational capabilities and those that are transformed into intelligent objects are used to monitor and gather information about the environment of a city, thereby leading to smart cities. The most important problem that is currently experienced by smart cities is waste management problem. The following factors directly affect this problem: an increase in urban areas and rapid population growth. Intelligent services can function as the frontline in obtaining information regarding every aspect of human activities. A typical example of a service provided by smart cities is waste management supported by IoT. Waste management involves different responsibilities, such as the collection, disposal, and utilization of waste in relevant facilities. A review of common waste management models is presented in this paper. Then, an enhanced waste management design is proposed. This design considers and deals with population and urban growth by using different truck sizes according to waste type and IoT devices that ease communication among system entities, such as smart bins, waste source areas, waste collection trucks, and waste management centers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","IoT; Smart city; Waste management","Bins; Population statistics; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Smart city; Soft computing; Solid wastes; Trucks; Urban growth; Waste disposal; Waste management; Computational capability; Intelligent devices; Intelligent Services; Internet of thing (IOT); Management problems; Radio frequency identification tags; Rapid population growth; Waste management systems; Internet of things","","","","","","","Boonrod K., Towprayoon S., Bonnet S., Tripetchkul S., Enhancing organic waste separation at the source behavior: A case study of the application of motivation mechanisms in communities in Thailand, Resour.

Many t-way testing strategies appear in the literature to-date ranging from general computational ones to meta-heuristic based. Owing to its performance, man the meta-heuristic based t-way strategies have gained significant attention recently (e.g. Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Algorithm, Harmony Search, Jaya Algorithm and Cuckoo Search). Jaya Algorithm (JA) is a new metaheuristic algorithm, has been used for solving different problems. However, losing the search's diversity is a common issue in the metaheuristic algorithm. In order to enhance JA's diversity, enhanced Jaya Algorithm strategy called Latin Hypercube Sampling Jaya Algorithm (LHS-JA) for Test Suite Generation is proposed. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is a sampling approach that can be used efficiently to improve search diversity. To evaluate the efficiency of LHS-JA, LHS-JA is compared against existing metaheuristic-based t-way strategies. Experimental results have shown promising results as LHS-JA can compete with existing t-way strategies. © 2020 ACM.","Application of Jaya algorithm; Jaya algorithm; Metaheuristic algorithm; Optimization algorithm; T-way Test Suite Generation","Ant colony optimization; Application programs; Geometry; Heuristic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Ant colony algorithms; Cuckoo searches; Harmony search; Latin hypercube sampling; Meta heuristic algorithm; Metaheuristic; Sampling strategies; T-Way strategies; Genetic algorithms","","","","","Universiti Malaysia Pahang, (RDU190372)","This research is funded by Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) grants “Prioritized t-way Test Suite Generation Strategy Based on Chaotic Flower Pollination Algorithm”, RDU190372.

It is aimed to verify the point doses in 192Ir high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy between Oncentra Masterplan brachytherapy treatment planning system and independent calculation software at a region of rectum, bladder and prescription points for both pair ovoids and full catheter set ups. The Oncentra TPS output text files were automatically loaded into the verification programme that has been developed based on spreadsheets. The output consists of source coordinates, desired calculation point coordinates and the dwell time of a patient plan. The source strength and reference dates were entered into the programme and then dose point calculations were independently performed. The programme shows its results in a comparison of its calculated point doses with the corresponding Oncentra TPS outcome. From the total of 40 clinical cases that consisted of two fractions for 20 patients, the results that were given in term of percentage difference, it shows an agreement between TPS and independent calculation are in the range of 2%.

In our world, there are billions of an internet device has the technical challenges to manage them. Although Internet access management techniques exist, they are using 3rd party or centralized techniques to offer a set of technical constraints to manage them globally. The Block-Chain (BC), a notebook technology, offers a solution to secure trust in decentralized systems, and combines the trust, consistency and use of the shared Ledger in a public network that could be useful for building confidence in Internet objects. However, the use of BC with Internet things by itself involves a lot of challenges and has become a hot topic. Therefore, a methodical review of literature is necessary to know what is the proposed on this subject. This paper discusses a survey of key issues and design factors in IoT security that need to be considered for Access Control (AC) model designers as the IoT security requirements. In addition, we offer a broad survey of modern AC frameworks in IoT object research. We classify the proposed mechanisms into two categories: traditional and decentralized. Besides, we are discussing how the BC can be a key enabling factor for the access management model designed in IoT security. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","AC; BC; IoT protocols; IoT security; Network security; Smart contracts","Access control; Actinium; Intelligent computing; Internet of things; Network protocols; Surveys; Trusted computing; Access management; Decentralized access control; Decentralized system; Internet of Things (IOT); IoT security; Security requirements; Technical challenges; Technical constraints; Network security","","","","","","","Siddiqa A., Shah M.A., Khattak H.A., Akhunzada A., Ali I., Razak Z.B., Gani A., Social internet of vehicles.

As it accesses databases it might change, steal the data, or destroy the database utterly. Currently, and with the implementation of sqlmap found in the literature being scarce and limited, SQL injection detection tools and methods are used without any detailed analysis of their strength and weakness. This paper demonstrated different types of SQL injection with an example, also we know how to detect the SQL injection, the paper shows the important tools that enable the detection of dangerous attacks to prevent the SQL injection and compares them according to the important performance parameter measures. Finally, with the implementation adopted on an ethical and legal website, the proposed paper implemented the most important tool which is called sqlmap. The implementation results reveal access to the database and extract the username and password. © 2022, Ismail Saritas.

Approaches to OWM must be matched to the characteristics of a certain population. In this consideration, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is no exception. Organizations are being aligned to focus on sustainability matters sharing significant features with universal trends, especially the integration of 3Rs (reducing waste, reusing, and recycling resources). However, the degree and nature of advancement in the direction of sustainability vary depending on the economic level of a state. High-income economies can afford to pay a higher price to integrate 3Rs technologies. Most recent endeavors have focused on achieving ‘Zero Waste’, which is costly for low-income developing countries. The expectations of OWM systems in KSA must be estimated. In this work, the situations in KSA and other countries are analyzed, and pertinent aspects are explored. Matters relating to the sustainability of OWM are conceptually assessed. This study proposes an integrated method for an organic waste management system to achieve sustainable OWM in the context of state policy and appropriate frameworks, suitable technology, institutional order, operational and monetary administration, and people consciousness and involvement. A genetic-based waste collection transportation algorithm that enhances the efficiency of waste collection truck management is presented in line with this technology. The selected routes based on the Rfs and IPv are the most efficient among those available for the examined smart bin destinations. The minimum Rfs of selected routes is less than the maximum Rfs of available routes by 2.63%. Also, the minimum IPv of selected routes is less than the maximum IPv of available routes by 27.08%. The proposed integrated approach, including the waste collection transportation algorithm, would be beneficial across a variety of country-specific layouts. © 2022 by the authors.

Large-scale VOD servers need to provision a large number of concurrent requests with fast response time. However, improving the performance of VOD server has become so obstructive and limited due to high latency of the disk access and low I/O operation of the magnetic HDDs. By contrast, flash-based solid-state drive (SSD) has fast access reading and provides large I/O operation per second that makes it as an interesting alternative choice. Nevertheless, using SSD instead of the entire HDD is very expensive due to SSD costs high in price per gigabyte. Accordingly, combination of HDD and SSD can enhance the performance of the storage subsystem of a VOD server in a cost-effective way. In this paper, hybrid storage system (HSS) is proposed in VOD server in order to increase the number of simultaneous user requests and decrease startup latency in an economic way. The top 10% of popular videos are kept in SSD to exploit its fast access for read-intensive workloads. Our results show that the design of our proposed HSS produces high performance than the conventional VOD HDD-based server which the enhancement in the average total response times for all different request sizes by 65%. Also, the throughput is enhanced by 200%. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Hard Disk Drives (HDDs); I/O response time; Solid-State-Drive (SSD); Throughput; Video On Demand (VOD)","Cost effectiveness; Flash-based SSDs; Hard disk storage; Response time (computer systems); Concurrent requests; Cost effective; Fast response time; Hard disk drives; Hybrid storage systems; Storage subsystems; Total response; Video-on-demand servers; Video on demand","","","","","","","Zhao Y., Jiang H., Zhou K., Huang Z., Huang P., Meeting service level agreement cost-effectively for video-on-demand applications in the cloud, INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications, pp. 298-306, (2014); Al-wesabi O.A., Sumari P., Al-wesabi M.A., Proxy caching strategies for multimedia distribution, Int.

The main aim of event detection is to define the presence or absence of an event. Various existing studies in the field of event detection depend on static or threshold values to reveal the occurrence of an event, which can result in imprecise sensor readings. Recently, many studies have utilized fuzzy logic to treat fluctuating sensor readings; as a result, they have decreased the number of false alarms created. However, there is some attention required when utilizing fuzzy logic. One aspect is that the efficiency and accuracy of the fuzzy membership function can be impacted by the utilization of heterogeneous sensors, which may increase the complexity of the fuzzy logic operation as the number of inputs rises. To address these issues, this paper proposes an approach named Probabilistic Collaborative Event Detection (PCED), which is a hybrid event detection technique that is based on a cluster WSN topology. The PCED approach utilizes a validated probabilistic technique for heterogeneous sensor nodes to transform sensing values into probability formulas and introduces a Cluster Head Decision Mechanism to make decisions based on the aggregated data from the sensors. The proposed approach employs fuzzy logic at the fusion center level to enhance the precision of event detection. The effectiveness of this method is thoroughly evaluated using MATLAB software, demonstrating an improvement in the probability of detection and a decrease in the probability of false alarms. PCED is compared to well-established event detection mechanisms such as the REFD mechanism. The results show that PCED reduces the occurrence of false alarms from 37 to 3 in certain scenarios, while improving detection accuracy by up to 19.4% over REDF and decreasing detection latency by up to 17.5%. © 2023 by the authors.","cluster head (CH); event detection; wireless sensor network (WSN)","Alarm systems; Computer circuits; Errors; MATLAB; Membership functions; Sensor nodes; Cluster head; Cluster-heads; Events detection; Fuzzy-Logic; Heterogeneous sensors; Indoor Events; Probabilistic detections; Probabilistics; Sensor readings; Wireless sensor network; Fuzzy logic","","","","","","","Thuc K.-X., Insoo K., A collaborative event detection scheme using fuzzy logic in clustered wireless sensor networks, AEU-Int.

Node mobility causes frequent topology changes which have negative impact on the network connectivity and performance. Therefore, routing is a serious challenge in such a dynamic environment as reliable paths and most efficient are always required between sources and their destinations. This paper presents routing algorithm based on an adjacency-constraint matrix using Genetic Algorithm (GA). GA presents the feasible paths that encoded in chromosomes that created based on the connectivity matrix. The evaluation function that is based on the adjacency-constraint matrix calculates the fitness values to select the most efficient path. With only two constraints, the performance simulation results of the proposed method showed that it outperforms Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) in term of transmission delay, which is decreased by about 25%. © 2015 IEEE.","DSR; GA; MANET; Routing algorithm","Algorithms; Big data; Computer software; Gallium; Mobile ad hoc networks; Routing algorithms; Software engineering; Adjacency constraints; Dynamic environments; Dynamic source routing; Infrastructure-less networks; MANET; Network connectivity; Performance simulation; Transmission delays; Genetic algorithms","","","","","","","Bouhorma M., Bentaouit H., Boudhir A., Performance comparison of ad-hoc routing protocols AODV and DSR, International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems, ICMCS '09, pp. 511-514, (2009); Aschenbruck N., Padilla E.G., Martini P., A survey on mobility models for performance analysis in tactical mobile networks, Journal of Telecommunications and Information Technology, 2, pp. 54-61, (2008); Wang Z., Crowcroft J., Quality of service for supporting multimedia applications, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 14, 7, pp. 1228-1234, (1996); Mary W., Kim C., A cost matrix agent for shortest path routing in ad hoc networks, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 33, 6, pp. 646-652, (2010); Kuipers F., Korkmaz T., Krunz M., Van Mieghem P., Performance evaluation of constraint-based path selection algorithms, IEEE Network: The Magazine of Global Internetworking, 18, pp. 16-23, (2004); Alazzawi L., Elkateeb A., Performance evaluation of the WSN routing protocols scalability, Journal of Computer Systems, Networks, and Communications, 2008, (2009); Sharma A., Lakkadwala P., Performance comparison of reactive and proactive routing protocols in Wireless Sensor Network, Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (ICRITO) (Trends and Future Directions), 3rd International Conference on, pp. 1-6, (2014); Rahman J., Hasan M., Islam M., Comparative analysis the performance of AODV, DSDV and DSR routing protocols in wireless sensor network, 2012 7th International Conference on Electrical Computer Engineering (ICECE), pp. 283-286, (2012); Leela R., Thanulekshmi N., Selvakumar S., Multi-constraint Qos unicast routing using genetic algorithm (MURUGA), Applied Soft Computing, 11, 2, pp. 1753-1761, (2011); Heydarian M., Mogavi R.H., A new high performance approach: Merging optimal multicast sessions for supporting multisource routing, The Journal of Supercomputing, 63, 3, pp. 871-896, (2013); Barolli L., Koyama A., Matsumoto K., Apduhan B.O., A Gabased multi-purpose optimization algorithm for QoS routing, AINA, 1, pp. 23-28, (2004); Munetomo M., Designing genetic algorithms for adaptive routing algorithms in the Internet, GECCO'99 Workshop on Evolutionary Telecoms: Past, Present and Future, (1999); Barolli L., Koyama A., Sawada H., Suganuma T., Shiratori N., A New QoS Routing Approach for Multimedia Applications Based on Genetic Algorithms, pp. 289-295, (2002); Abdullah N., Baklizi M., Al-Wesabi O., Abdulqader A., Abdulqader A., Ramadass S., Ahmadpour S., Video delivery based on multi-constraint genetic and tabu search algorithms, International Journal of Computer Science, 9, 2, (2011); Umar U.A., Ariffin M.K.A., Ismail N., Tang S.H., Priority-based genetic algorithm for conflict-free automated guided vehicle routing, Procedia Engineering, 50, pp. 732-739, (2012); Lu T., Zhu J., A genetic algorithm for finding a path subject to two constraints, Applied Soft Computing, 13, 2, pp. 891-898, (2013); Abdullah N., Baklizi M., Ramadas S., Al-Wesabi O., Multiconstrained routing using genetic algorithm, RFID-Technologies and Applications (RFID-TA), 2013 IEEE International Conference, pp. 1-4, (2013); Abdullah N., Al-Wesabi O., Kadhum M.M., Baklizi M., Efficient path selection with priority constraints using genetic algorithm, International Workshop on Graph Algorithms (IWGA2015), pp. 231-241, (2015)","","Zain J.M.; Majid M.A.; Ameedeen M.A.; Arshah R.A.; Azmi Z.R.M.; Mustaffa Z.M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","4th International Conference on Software Engineering and Computer Systems, ICSECS 2015","19 August 2015 through 21 August 2015","Kuantan, Pahang","118307","","978-146736722-6","","","English","Int.

This component consists of use hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and RAM, collectively fulfilling the requirement of simultaneous fast data access and large data distribution to numerous users. However, current hybrid storage systems still pose numerous challenges. The integration and roles of the HDD, SSD, and RAM are relatively weak in terms of optimizing fast access prior to streaming to a large number of simultaneous users. The HDD and SSD exhibit poor data layout and streaming controller in supporting the production of a high number of simultaneous streams. This paper proposes (1) the flash cache hybrid storage system (FCHSS) VOD servers. The FCHSS architecture has no RAM, which is removed and replaced by a flash-based SSD. (2) The new data layout stores thousands of video segments in the HDD and SSD. The streaming management scheme, namely, flash cache-data streaming controller (FC-DSC), is also proposed to support FCHSS. The proposed VOD server-based FCHSS with the FC-DSC shows a 73.53% and 23.71% enhancement in average total response time, and a 35.63% and 298.91% enhancement in throughputs for all request sizes compared with the average of the total response time and throughputs of the hybrid storage system HSS VOD server-and the VOD server-based feedback-based adaptive data migration (FADM). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Flash cache hybrid storage system (FCHSS); Flash cache-data streaming controller (FC-DSC); Hard disk drives (HDDs); I/O response time; Solid-state-drive (SSD); Throughput; Video on demand (VOD)","Controllers; Data reduction; Drives; Flash-based SSDs; Intelligent computing; Random access storage; Response time (computer systems); Storage management; Throughput; Video on demand; Cache data; Hard disk drives; Hybrid storage systems; Solid state drives (SSD); Video on demands (VoD); Hard disk storage","","","","","","","Al-Wesabi O.A., Sumari P., Al-Wesabi M.A., Proxy caching strategies for multimedia distribution, Int.

Many of these have envisaged a chance to establish devoted municipal access networks to assist all kinds of city administration and preserve services needing data connectivity. Organizations unanimously concentrate on sustainability issues with key features of general trends, particularly the combination of the 3Rs (reduce waste, reuse and recycle resources). This paper demonstrates how the incorporation of the Internet of Things (IoT) with data access networks, geographic information systems and combinatorial optimization can contribute to enhancing cities’ administration systems. A waste-gathering approach based on supplying smart bins is introduced by using an IoT prototype embedded with sensors, which can read and convey bin volume data over the Internet. However, from another perspective, the population and residents’ attitudes directly affect the control of the waste management system. The conventional waste collection system does not cover all areas in the city. It works based on a planned scheme that is implemented by the authorized organization focused on specific popular and formal areas. The conventional system cannot observe a real-time update of the bin status to recognize whether the waste level condition is ‘full,’ ‘not full,’ or ‘empty.’ This paper uses IoT in the container and trucks that secure the overflow and separation of waste. Waste source locations and population density influence the volume of waste generation, especially waste food, as it has the highest amount of waste generation. The open public area and the small space location problems are solved by proposing different truck sizes based on the waste type. Each container is used for one type of waste, such as food, plastic and others, and uses the optimization algorithm to calculate and find the optimal route toward the full waste container. In this work, the situations in KSA are evaluated, and relevant aspects are explored. Issues relating to the sustainability of organic waste management are conceptually analyzed. A genetic-based optimization algorithm for waste collection transportation enhances the performance of waste-gathering truck management. The selected routes based on the volume status and free spaces of the smart bins are the most effective through those obtainable towards the urgent smart bin targets. The proposed system outperforms other systems by reducing the number of locations and smart bins that have to be visited by 46% for all waste types, whereas the conventional and existing systems have to visit all locations every day, resulting in high cost and consumption time. © 2022 by the authors.","environmental logistics; IoT; public area; smart city; smart infrastructure; urban","Cities; Geographic Information Systems; Plastics; Recycling; Waste Management; Makkah [Saudi Arabia]; Mecca; Saudi Arabia; plastic; algorithm; GIS; Internet; optimization; public space; sensor; smart city; trucking; waste management; algorithm; Article; attitude to computers; data processing; geographic information system; internet of things; organic waste; population density; process optimization; Saudi Arabia; urban area; waste management; city; procedures; recycling","","Plastics, ","","","University of Hail, UOH, (RG-20 044)","Funding text 1: This research has been funded by the Scientific Research Deanship at the University of Ha’il, Saudi Arabia, through project number RG-20 044.; Funding text 2: We would like to acknowledge the Scientific Research Deanship at the University of Ha’il, Saudi Arabia, for funding this research.

However, the inherent openness of the VANETs wireless communication channel calls for careful scrutiny of its security, privacy and efficiency. This paper proposed a New and Efficient Conditional Privacy-Preserving Authentication (NE-CPPA) scheme to secure the communication in VANETs. NE-CPPA uses the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm to fulfil the security and privacy requirements. The security analysis of the proposed scheme under various attack scenarios are presented. Then, the computation and communication costs analysis is conducted to show its feasibility and robustness. Performance evaluation showed that the NE-CPPA scheme has a lower system overhead in terms of computation and communication costs than existing schemes. Thus, the proposed NE-CPPA scheme is appropriate for securing the deployment and adoption of VANETs. © 2020.

The hybrid storage system, which combines HDDs and SSD in the server, has become popular because of such requirements. The combination of both storage modes is relatively weak in terms of optimising fast access prior and in supporting the production of a high number of simultaneous streams. This paper presents an enhanced hybrid storage system (EHSS)-based VOD server to improve the performance of the VOD server. The design of the EHSS and its streaming management scheme produce high performance and satisfy the performance requirements of a VOD server in terms of I/O throughput and access latency. The experimental results show that the proposed work provides better performance than the VOD server-based FADM because it enhances the average response times for the various scales of intensive workload by 69.89%.

Every node can act as a router and has responsibility to forward packets on behalf of another node towards the destination. Many routing algorithms have been proposed for MANETs. Each algorithm is designed with unique features to deal with challenges of routing in MANETs. This paper improves genetic routing algorithm based on adjacency constraint matrix. The improved version of the genetic routing algorithm is called GARAM. GARAM utilizes the genetic algorithm in term of gene structure and interconnection with the adjacency matrix. It helps to find multipath instead of one single path. The order of the selected paths is based on fitness value. Performance evaluation was carried out to investigate the effect of number of nodes on the efficiency of selected paths. The simulation results show that the GARAM algorithm supports multiple-path routing protocol in MANETs. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

The purpose of using Markov is two folds, the first is to implement DGRED with multiple traffic classes, where in each class may have different priorities and the second is to enhance the mechanism of DGRED in stabilizing the average queue length (aql) between the allocated threshold values of minthreshold and maxthreshold, using variable calculating parameters, which is stored in the utilized states of Markov. The (MMBP-3) is employed to replace the conservative and widely used Bernoulli process (BP) in assessing DGRED method. Accordingly, a three dimensional discrete time Markov chain is provided to implement DGRED algorithm for three traffic classes where each dimension corresponds to a traffic class with its own parameters. The (MMBP-3) is deal with correlation and burstiness in the network traffic. The developed algorithm allows for faster response to the changes in the network, congestion-to-non-congestion and non-congestion-to-congestion, which lead to decrease packet losses and improvement of network performance. The proposed method is evaluated in comparison to the DGRED and other AQM methods, the results reveal that the proposed algorithm provides better performance compared to DGRED, RED, GRED, and Adaptive GRED in relations of delay packet loss, delay and mean queue length. The most appropriate arrival process for DGRED method is IBP for D, mql, PL, and DP while congestion occurs. Though, this process cannot discourse correlation. Thus MMBP-3 is the greatest choice as it detects both correlation and bursty things. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","(RED); Adaptive GRED; Congestion control; MMBP-3; Performance evaluation; Simulation","","","","","","","","Thiruchelvi G., Raja J., A Survey On Active Queue Management Mechanisms, IJCSNS International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 8, (2008);

To smooth the impact of wind energy fluctuations on the power grid and power supply, much research has predicted the wind speed of wind farms to estimate power generation. However, most studies overlook the nonlinear relationship between wind speed and power generation, and data sources are usually limited to one or two wind farms. This study constructs a wind power density prediction model based on the LightGBM and artificial neural network to solve the above problems. Its data collection process does not require meteorological measurement equipment and has good universality, stability, and robustness. LightGBM is used to extract feature information and then train it using an artificial neural network, which has a high tolerance for data loss. The model performance was validated using data from six terrains from 2020 to 2022. While results showed that the average prediction error was 71.68 % less than 2 % and 82.188 % less than 6 %, with an average R2 of 0.9755 and an average correlation coefficient of 0.9875, proving the practical significance of the model that can be used to guide electricity trade. © 2023 The Authors","Artificial neural network; LightGBM; Next hour forecasting; Random forest; Short-term; Wind power density","","","","","","","","Carbon Neutrality in the UNECE Region: Integrated Life-Cycle Assessment of Electricity Sources, (2022); Guezuraga B., Zauner R., Polz W., Life cycle assessment of two different 2 MW class wind turbines, Renew.

Most cryptographic hash functions have been based on the Merkle-Damgård construction, which converts a message with an arbitrary length into a fixed-length hash digest. The problem with the Merkle-Damgård construction is its computation time, which increases gradually as the input size increases when the processes run sequentially. In this paper, we proposed an alternative construction to reduce the computation time and improve the overall hashing efficiency. The proposed method is the Multi-Pipeline Hash Construction (MPHC), which presents overlapping execution between independent block functions. The MPHC runs in parallel on multi-core machines and enhances the hashing performance in terms of speedup and efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the MPHC performs better than the Merkle-Damgård construction, and the security analysis proves that the MPHC produces better-quality hash digests than the Merkle-Damgård construction in terms of the randomness of the digest value. © 2012 ICIC International.","Hash function; Merkle-Damgård construction; Multi-pipeline hash construction (MPHC); Secure hash algorithm (SHA); Speedup","Hash functions; Security of data; Computation time; Cryptographic hash functions; Data integrity; Hashing functions; Input size; Message authentication; Multi-core machines; Multi-pipeline hash construction (MPHC); Secure hash algorithm; Security analysis; Speedup; Pipelines","","","","","","","Merkle R., Secrecy, Authentication, and Public Key Systems, (1979); Merkle R., A certified digital signature, Advances In Cryptology - CRYPTO Proceedings, Lecture Notes In Computer Science, 435, pp. 218-238, (1989); Damgard I., A design principle for hash functions, Proc. of the 9th Annual International Cryptology Conference On Advances In Cryptology, pp. 416-427, (1989); Biham E., Dunkelman O., Framework for iterative hash functions HAIFA, Proc. of the 2nd NIST Hash Functions Workshop, (2006); Liskov M., Constructing Secure Hash Functions From Weak Compression Functions: The Case For Non-Streamable Hash Functions, (2006); Lucks S., A failure-friendly design principle for hash functions, Proc. of the 11th International Conference On the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security, 3788, pp. 474-494, (2005); Gauravaram P., Millan W., Dawson E., Viswanathan K., Constructing secure hash functions by enhancing Merkle-Damgard construction, Proc. of the 11th Australasian Conference (ACISP), 4058, pp. 407-420, (2006); Martin J.W., Essence: A candidate hashing algorithm for the NIST competition, Submission to National Institute of Standards and Technology, (2008); Xiao J., Zou X., Liu Z., Guo X., A novel adaptive interpolation algorithm for image resizing, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 3, 6 A, pp. 1335-1345, (2007); Pongyupinpanich S., Choomchuay S., An architecture for a SHA-1 applied for DSA, Proc. of the 1st Electrical Eng./Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications, and Information Technology Conference, pp. 133-136, (2004); Elkamchouchi H.M., Nasr M.E., Abdelfatah R.I., A new secure and fast hashing algorithm (SFHA-256), Proc. of the 25th IEEE Xplore National Radio Science Conference, pp. 1-8, (2008); Chuah C., Samsudin A., Omega network hash construction, Journal of Computer Science, 5, pp. 965-976, (2009); Stalling W., Cryptography and Network Security Principle and Practices, (2011); Gay O., FIPS 180-2 Hash Algorithms SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 Implementation, (2007); Marsaglia G., The Marsaglia Random Number CDROM Including the Diehard Battery of Tests of Randomness, (1996); Amdahl G., Validity of the single-processor approach to achieving large scale computing capabilities, Proc. of AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference, 30, pp. 483-485, (1967); Gustafson J., Reevaluating Amdahl's law, Communications of the ACM, 31, 5, pp. 532-533, (1988); Camargos A., Batalha R., Martins C., Silva E.J., Soares G.L., Superlinear speedup in a 3-D parallel conjugate gradient solver, IEEE Transactions, 45, 3, pp. 1602-1605, (2009); He J., Yao X., Analysis of scalable parallel evolutionary algorithms, Proc. of the IEEE Congress On Evolutionary Computation, pp. 427-434, (2006); Kusic D., Hoare R., Jones A.K., Fazekas J., Foster J., Extracting Speedup From C-code With Poor Instruction-level Parallelism, Proc. of the 19th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, 15, pp. 2649-26418, (2005)","O.

Generally, the proposed DGRED algorithm depends on the stability of the average queue length at a specific level between allocated minimum and maximum threshold values, with the aim to improve the network performance. The DGRED algorithm is simulated and compared with the most known Active Queue Management Early Detection (RED) algorithm and two of its variants, namely, Gentle RED and Adaptive GRED. This comparison was conducted based on different performance measures, such as mean queue length, throughput, average queuing delay, packet loss, and dropping probability for packets. The comparison aimed to identify the algorithm that offers better performance measurement results under either non-congestion or congestion situation at the router buffers. The acquired results show that the proposed algorithm contributes in providing lesser queue length, delayed queuing, and packet loss probability compared with the existing algorithms when high packet arrival probability appears, that is, (> 0:63). Furthermore, DGRED generates adequate throughput when the packet arrival probability value is high. © 2013 ICIC International.","Adaptive GRED; Congestion control; Gentle random early detection (GRED); Performance evaluation; Random early detection (RED); Simulation","Congestion control (communication); Network performance; Probability; Queueing networks; Queueing theory; Active Queue Management; Adaptive GRED; Average queue lengths; Better performance; Congestion detection; Dropping probability; Mean queue lengths; Packet arrivals; Packet loss probability; Performance evaluation; Performance measure; Queue lengths; Queuing delay; Random Early Detections; Router buffer; Simulation; Algorithms","","","","","","","Thiruchelvi G., Raja J., A survey on active queue management mechanisms, IJCSNS International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 8, (2008); Welzl M., Network congestion control, Proc. of Managing Internet Traffic, (2005); Tanenbaum A.S., Computer Networks, (2002); Lin D., Morris R., Dynamics of random early detection, Proc. of ACM SIGCOMM, pp. 127-137, (1997); Floyd S., Jacobson V., Random early detection gateways for congestion avoidance, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, pp. 397-413, (1993); Floyd S., Recommendations on Using the Gentle Variant of RED, (2000); Baklizi M., Et al., Performance assessment of AGRED, RED and GRED congestion control algorithms, Information Technology Journal, 11, pp. 255-261, (2012); Ababneh J., Et al., Derivation of three queue nodes discrete-time analytical model based on DRED algorithm, Proc. of the 7th International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations, pp. 885-890, (2010); Abdel-jaber H., Et al., Traffic management for the gentle random early detection using discretetime queueing, Proc. of International Business Information Management Conference, pp. 289-298, (2008); Abdel-Jaber H., Et al., Performance evaluation for DRED discrete-time queueing network analytical model, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 31, pp. 750-770, (2008); Abdel-jaber H., Et al., Modelling BLUE active queue management using discrete-time queue, Proc. of 2007 International Conference of Information Security and Internet Engineering, pp. 568-573, (2007); Moareanpour A., Majd V.J., Input-to-state stability in congestion control problem of computer networks with nonlinear links, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 5, 8, pp. 2091-2106, (2009); Chen X., Liu T., Zhao J., A logic-based switching control approach to active queue management for transmission control protocol, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 4, 7, pp. 1811-1820, (2008); Brandauer C., Et al., Comparison of tail drop and active queue management performance for bulk-data and web-like Internet, Proc. of IEEE ISCC 2001, pp. 122-129, (2001); Stanojevic R., Et al., Adaptive tuning of drop-tail buffers for reducing queueing delays, IEEE, Communications Letters, 10, pp. 570-572, (2006); Bitorika A., Et al., A comparative study of active queue management schemes, Proc. of IEEE ICC 2004, Congestion Control Under Dynamic Weather Condition, (2004); Ryu S., Active Queue Management (AQM) Based Internet Congestion Control, (2002); Salim J.H., Et al., Performance evaluation of explicit congestion notification (ECN) in IP networks, RFC 2884, (2000); Chu H.-Y., Tsai K.-H., Chang W.-J., Fuzzy control of active queue management routers for transmission control protocol networks via time-delay affine Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 4, 2, pp. 291-312, (2008); Wu-chang F., Et al., The blue active queue management algorithms, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 10, pp. 513-528, (2002); Floyd S., Et al., Adaptive RED: An algorithm for increasing the robustness of RED's active queue management, AT&T Center for Internet Research, (2001); Aweya J., Et al., A control theoretic approach to active queue management, Computer Networks, 36, pp. 203-235, (2001); Woodward M.E., Communication and Computer Networks: Modelling with Discrete-Time Queues, (1994)","M.

Which deals directly with the databases in which data and information are stored, organized, retrieved, and processed. Therefore, most of its attacks are on databases. Therefore, web applications must be secure enough to prevent access to customs databases, destruction, and theft of bank accounts and transactions. Thus, most SQL injection attacks are carried out through character spacing, as it is the tool used by hackers to find a vulnerability on the web. This paper proposes a new algorithm to prevent hackers from accessing databases early on through the web application without accessing databases. The proposed algorithm is designed to protect the web application from being voluntarily inserted by using a bind parameter, blocking the hacker's address, and rejecting his request when executing the query. Also, this algorithm is designed to work in more than one layer, as it works at the web application and URL levels so that things are sufficiently protected. The comparison was made with the algorithms SQLPMDS, SIUQAPTT, and blind SQL injection, and the results showed that the presented algorithm gave better results based on more than one measure. © Ismail Saritas.

As a network term, congestion usually occurs when the incoming packets exceed the available network resources. This study proposed an Adaptive Gentle Random Early Detection (AGRED) algorithm based on Gentle Random Early Detection (GRED) algorithm in order to detect congestion at router buffer at a preliminary stage and thus enhance the parameter setting of the max threshold and the D max. The AGRED algorithm is simulated and compared with the original GRED and Random Early Detection (RED). The simulation results for the proposed AGRED, RED and GRED algorithms are carried out by varying the variable of packet arrival probability. During congestion, the simulation results reveal that AGRED offers marginally better performance results than RED and GRED, with regard to mean queue length, average queuing delay and packet loss probability due to overflow. Therefore, the AGRED is an effective method in controlling congestion at router buffers of networks. Whereby, improve networks performance. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Active queue management; Discrete-time queue; Packet loss; Performance evaluation; Queuing network","Congestion control (communication); Packet loss; Queueing networks; Active Queue Management; Critical issues; Discrete time queues; Incoming packets; Mean queue lengths; Network resource; Packet arrivals; Packet loss probability; Parameter setting; Performance assessment; Performance evaluation; Queuing delay; Queuing network; Random Early Detections; Rapid development; Router buffer; Algorithms","","","","","","","Ababneh J., Abdel-Jaber H., Thabtah F., Hadi W., Badarneh E., Derivation of three queue nodes discrete-time analytical model based on DRED algorithm, Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations, pp. 885-890, (2010); Abdel-Jaber H., Woodward M., Thabtah F., Al-diabat M., Modelling blue active queue management using discrete-time queue, Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering, pp. 568-573, (2007); Abdel-Jaber H., Woodward M., Thabtah F., Abu-Ali A., Performance evaluation for DRED discrete-time queueing network analytical model, J.
