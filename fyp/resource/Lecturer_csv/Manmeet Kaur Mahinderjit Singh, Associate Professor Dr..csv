This supply-chain environment can only be effective if the partners can trust each other and be collaborative. However, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) involves growing privacy and security concerns in part because humans cannot sense the radio frequency radiation used to read tags and the tags themselves maintain no history of past readings. Counterfeiting in the form of cloned or fraudulent RFID tags is a consequence of a lack of security measures and trust among the partners when RFID technology is used to automate their business transactions. This paper discusses the ways in which privacy and security protection can be maintained in an open-loop RFID supply chain. A cost-based detection of counterfeit tags using different classifiers is presented. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Cloning; Privacy; SCM; Security; Supply chain management","Clone cells; Cloning;

However, WID still faces several challenges and issues while implementing and evaluating in Supply Chain Management technologies. Due to security concern, the SCM data are exposed to active and passive attacks that lead to counterfeiting attacks: fraud and cloned attacks. For an organization data most treasured assets, information sharing between different companies become an issue. This is because different organizations have dfferent role and responsibilities in data management and security policies in their environment. We propose testing and evaluating techniques for access control model policies. Based on findings, we have chosen Role Base Access Control (RBAC) most suitable canddate for an access control model. Furthermore, we have implemented RBAC and Event Condtion Action (ECA) to context-aware security policy based WID SCM in order to tackle counterfeiting attacks. The findings suggest the generation of five main security policies model in thwarting counterfeiting for any WID-enabled supply chain. © Medwell Journals, 2017.","Access control; Context aware policies; Counterfeiting; Rado Frequency Identification (WID); Supply Chain Management (SCM)","","","","","","","","Ausanka-Cmes R., Methods for access control: Advances and limitatiom, (2001); Belokosztolszki A., Role-based access control policy administration, (2004); Derakhshan R., Orlowska M.E., Li X., RFID data management: Challenges and opportunities, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on RFID, pp. 175-182, (2007); Dey A.K., Abowd G.D., Wood A., CyberDesk: A framework for providing self-integrating context-awareservices Knowledge Based Syst, 11, pp. 3-13, (1998); Dey A.K., Abowd G.D., Salber D., A conceptual framework and a toolkit for supporting the rapid prototyping of context-aware applicatiom, Human-Comput.

However, due to its portability and information available through social network, BYOD has become susceptible to information stealing attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack. APT attack uses tricky methods in getting access into the target’s machine and mostly motives and stand as a threat to politics, corporate, academic and even military. Various mitigation techniques have been proposed in tackling this attack but, most of them are relying on available information of the attacks and does not provide data protection. Hence, it is challenging in providing protection against APT attack. In this paper, we will investigate on the available mitigation techniques and its problems in tackling APT attack by looking on the root cause of the attack inside BYOD environment. Lastly, based on the information obtained we will propose a new framework in reducing APT attack. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Access control; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) model; Framework; MLS","Security of data; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Bring your own devices; Control framework; Framework; Mitigation techniques; MLS; Multi-level security; Threat mitigation; Access control","","","","","","","Fischer N., Smolnik S., The impact of mobile computing on individuals, organizations, and society - synthesis of existing literature and directions for future research, IEEE 2013 46Th Hawaii International Conference System Sciences (HICSS), pp. 1082-1091, (2013); Dover S., CBS News, Study: Number of Smartphone Users Tops 1 Billion; La Polla M., Martinelli F., Sgandurra D., A Survey on Security for Mobile Devices, IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 15, 1, pp. 446-471, (2013); Fossi M., Egan G.Y., Haley K., Johnson E., Mack T., Adams T., Blackbird J., Low M.K., Mazurek D., McKinney D., Wood P., Symantec Internet Security Threat Report – Trends for 2010, 16, (2011); Schmidt A., Schmidt H., Batyuk L., Clausen J.H., Camtepe S.A., Albayrak A., Smartphone malware evolution revisited: Android next target?, IEEE 2009 4Th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE), pp. 1-7, (2009); Tankard C., Advanced Persistent Threats and How to Monitor and Deter Them, Network Security, 2011, 8, pp. 16-19, (2011); Sood A.K., Enbody R.J., Targeted Cyberattacks: A Superset of Advanced Persistent Threats, IEEE Security & Privacy, 11, 1, pp. 54-61, (2013); Mustafa T., Malicious data leak prevention and purposeful evasion attacks: An approach to advanced persistent threat (APT) management, 2013 Saudi International Electronics, Communications and Photonics Conference, SIECPC, pp. 1-5, (2013); Virvilis N., Gritzalis D., Trusted computing vs. Advanced persistent threats: Can a defender win this game?, 2013 IEEE 10Th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing (UIC/ATC) Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing, pp. 396-403, (2013); Parmar B., Protecting against spear-phishing, Computer Fraud & Security, 2012, 1, pp. 8-11, (2012); Hipolito J.M., DUQU Uses STUXNET-Like Techniques to Conduct Information Theft, Trendmicro; Storm D., Red October 5-year cyber espionage attack: Malware resurrects itself, Computerworld, (2013); Great Miniduke is Back: Nemesis Gemina and the Botgen Studio, (2013); Morrow B., BYOD security challenges: Control and protect your most sensitive data, Network Security, 2012, 12, pp. 5-8, (2012); Noor M.M., Hassan W.H., Wireless Networks: Developments, Threats and Countermeasures, International Journal of Digital Information and Wireless Communication (IJDIWC), 3, 1, pp. 119-134, (2013); Meadows R., ISACA Global Study: Organizations Not Prepared for Advanced Cyberthreats, Big Gaps in Education and Mobile Security Remain, (2014); Leavitt N., Today’s Mobile Security Requires a New Approach, Computer, 46, 11, pp. 16-19, (2013); The Need for IT to Get in front of the BYOD Problem, (2012); Websense: Advanced Persistent Threats and Other Advanced Attacks: Threat Analysis and Defense Strategies for SMB, Mid-Size, and Enterprise Organizations, (2011); Zhauniarovich Y., Russello G., Conti M., Crispo B., Fernandes E., MOSES: Supporting and Enforcing Security Profiles on Smartphones, IEEE Transactions Dependable and Secure Computing, 11, 3, pp. 211-223, (2014); Jafarian J.H., Amini M., Jalili R., A context-aware mandatory access control model for multilevel security environments, SAFECOMP 2008.

These data are exposed to various types of cyberattacks, one of which is advanced persistent threats (APTs). APTs are stealthy and focus on sophisticated, specific targets. One reason for the detection failure of APTs is the nature of the attack pattern, which changes rapidly based on advancements in hacking. The need for future researchers to understand the gap in the literature regarding APT detection and to explore improved detection techniques has become crucial. Thus, this systematic literature review (SLR) examines the different approaches used to detect APT attacks directed at the network system in terms of approach and assessment metrics. The SLR includes papers on computer, mobile, and internet of things (IoT) technologies. We performed an SLR by searching six leading scientific databases to identify 75 studies that were published from 2012 to 2022. The findings from the SLR are discussed in terms of the literature's research gaps, and the study provides essential recommendations for designing a model for early APT detection. We propose a conceptual model known as the Effective Cyber Situational Awareness Model to Detect and Predict Mobile APTs (ECSA-tDP-MAPT), designed to effectively detect and predict APT attacks on mobile network traffic. © 2023 The Authors","APT malware; Attack behaviour; Intrusion detection system; Machine learning; Network traffic; Situation awareness model","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/ICT07/USM/02/2); Mustansiriyah University","This work is supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with project code FRGS/1/2020/ICT07/USM/02/2.

Several lines of evidence, however, have indicated that lipids account only for the <50% of variability in cardiovascular risk in the United States. Therefore, for better identification of people at high cardiovascular risk, a more effective and complete approach is required. Our understanding of atherosclerosis has shifted from a focal disease resulting in symptoms caused by severe stenosis to a systemic disease distinguished by plaque inflammation with a potential to rupture and thrombosis, turning a substenotic atherosclerotic lesion into a complete occlusive lesion. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is a novel inflammatory biomarker that can provide much needed information about plaque inflammation and plaque stability. Lp-PLA2 is among the multiple biomarkers that have been associated with increased CHD risk. In this present work, we review the evidence from previous studies addressing the effect of different therapies on decreasing Lp-PLA2 and the role of direct Lp-PLA2 inhibitors. This work also briefly reviews the evidence of Lp-PLA2 clinical utility as a potential marker of vascular inflammation and formation of rupture prone plaques. Additionally, we also discuss the implication of available evidence in context of current cardiovascular inflammatory biomarkers recommendations and the evidence from epidemiologic studies addressing the relationship of Lp-PLA2 and risk of cardiovascular disease. © 2009 National Lipid Association.","Cardiovascular disease; Darapladib; HDL-C; Hepatitis-C; Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub>; Plaque rupture","Hepatitis C virus; 1 alkyl 2 acetylglycerophosphocholine esterase; atorvastatin; biological marker; darapladib; enzyme inhibitor; ezetimibe; fluindostatin; lipid; nicotinic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; placebo; pravastatin; rosuvastatin; simvastatin; add on therapy; atherosclerosis; atherosclerotic plaque; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; clinical trial; high risk patient; human; ischemic heart disease; patient identification; priority journal; review; risk assessment; risk reduction; stenosis; systemic disease; United States","","atorvastatin, 134523-00-5, 134523-03-8; darapladib, 356057-34-6; ezetimibe, 163222-33-1; fluindostatin, 93957-54-1; lipid, 66455-18-3; nicotinic acid, 54-86-4, 59-67-6; pravastatin, 81131-74-0; rosuvastatin, 147098-18-8, 147098-20-2; simvastatin, 79902-63-9","","","","","Atkinson Jr. A.J., Colburn W.A., Degruttola V.G., Biomarkers and surrogate endpoints: preferred definitions and conceptual framework, Clin Pharmacol Therapeut, 69, pp. 89-95, (2001); Casas J.P., Shah T., Cooper J., Et al., Insight into the nature of the CRP-coronary event association using Mendelian randomization, Int J Epidemiol, 35, pp. 922-931, (2006); Davey Smith G., Lawlor D.A., Harbord R., Et al., Association of C-reactive protein with blood pressure and hypertension: life course confounding and mendelian randomization tests of causality, Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 25, pp. 1051-1056, (2005); Ridker P.M., Danielson E., Fonseca F.A., Et al., JUPITER Study Group.

Physicians have the capacity to share all of their patients’ information with their colleagues without any permission or concern from the patients. For this reason, it is of utmost importance to design a breast self-examination system that can keep monthly track of self-exam data and communication between patient and physician. To develop such a system, identify the ethical values and trustworthiness as an indicator. Then, the survey will provide the details on ethical values and trustworthiness applicable in the system. Therefore, this research objective on the importance of ethical value and trustworthiness in the healthcare system. The survey on 772 respondents leading to the importance of the ethical value being used in the healthcare system is required. The ethical value of interaction, integrity, confidentiality, protection, caring, and fairness have a significant influence on the healthcare system. The path coefficients are answering Hypothesis I in presenting the positive relationship and significant effect between ethical value and BSE system (P<.001). On the other side, trustworthiness has a significant influence on the healthcare system. The path coefficients are answering Hypothesis II in presenting the positive relationship and significant effect between trustworthiness and the BSE system (P<.001). Finally, the relationship in healthcare between trustworthiness and ethical value is on integrity with honesty and belief. © 2020.

Breast cancer cannot be detected easily in the early stage of the tumor development. This is one of the reasons why patient only seeks help from the doctor when the tumor is already in a critical stage. This research proposes to diagnose the type of lump of breast lump among woman by using data mining algorithm which could help the medical practitioner to diagnose breast lumps without the intervention of surgical biopsy. The dataset used for the research are obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison in the United States of America (USA) which was collected by Dr. William H. Wolberg. Five different algorithms are used to analyze the breast cancer data set is applied to determine the level of accuracy for each algorithm in detecting whether the patient’s breast lump is cancerous or non-cancerous. Overall, ADTree has higher accuracy with missing values and Random Forest has highest ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) of 99.3% without missing values. ROC is the value under curve that use binary classification between true positive rate and false positive rate and examine the output of the classifier. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Breast cancer; Classifier; Data mining","","","","","","","","Ma J., Ahmedin J., Breast Cancer Metastasis and Drug Resistance, (2013); Komen S.G., Facts for Life: What is Breast Cancer?, (2014); (2014); Ann Clark R., Et al., The Biology of Breast Cancer, Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors in New York State, (1997); Kharya S., Using Data Mining Techniques for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Cancer Disease, (2012); Ahmad L.G., Eshlaghy A.T., Poorebrahimi A., Ebrahimi M., Razavi A.R., J.

This traditional system requires the user to fill in their timesheets or sign on the attendance sheet manually. The practice inefficient and ineffective for university's student attendance recording due to, i) lecturer may lose the attendance sheet, ii) student may sign for their friends, iii) student may forget to sign on the attendance sheet, and iv) challenging to monitor attendance rate and analysis. As a result, conventional attendance tracking methods must be replaced with more reliable ones. The attendance rate is important because students can focus and score better results if they attend classes consistently. As such, a mobile app, namely Smart-Hadir, is designed to overcome problems as mentioned above. Smart-Hadir is a smartphone application developed by UMS aimed to record student attendance digitally during a class session. The technology used is slightly different from the existing applications, where Smart-Hadir is not using RFID technology but rather covers NFC, QR code, and beacon technologies. Attendance could be taken either using NFC or QR code displayed on the wall using a projector or scan the available beacon. Lecturers can create class session using the Smart-Hadir anywhere and anytime. Students are then required to take their attendance either scan the QR code, search the beacon, or swiped their student card on the lecturer's phone. The students' attendance will be immediately captured and saved into the database. Lecturers will be able to view the statistic report, identify and e-mail absentees, as well as monitor students' attendance behaviour. A statistical report can be generated. It shows the percentages of students' attendance rate, absent rate, and status. The Smart-Hadir is advantageous as it can be used to capture meeting or event attendance record as well. © 2021.

However, even with the simplicity and security that the technology provide, the adoption of this technology is not widespread. In this paper, we describe the user-friendliness criteria essential for NFC technology through a proposed library system. To determine the criteria of user-friendliness for the technology, we conducted a survey on the understanding and usage of different users that would be exposed to a library system. The survey included questions about the existing library system (OPAC) and their perception of the NFC technology. Based on the results, we managed to identify that the OPAC system is not a userfriendly library system. Further, we have also identified that there are three main user-friendliness criteria deemed necessary by users for an NFC-enabled library system to be more effective than the OPAC system: usability, security and efficiency. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Near-field communication; OPAC system; Radio frequency identification (RFID)","","","","","","","","Steffen R., Preibinger J., Schollermann T., Muller A., Schnabel I., Near Field Communication (NFC) in an Automotive Environment: Use Cases, Architecture and Realization.

Lp-PLA2 activity is correlated with the degree of inflammation in the atherosclerotic plaque. In human blood, approximately 80% of Lp-PLA2 is associated with low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Thus, it is hypothesized that changes in Lp-PLA2 should imitate the changes in the LDL cholesterol. Objective: In this present study, we examined the efficacy of lifestyle intervention and combination lipid-lowering therapy on reducing the Lp-PLA2 levels and determined the relationship between changes in LDL-C and Lp-PLA2. Methods: This retrospective chart review study includes two hundred forty eight patients (58% men and 42% women) who completed the life style intervention in combination with pharmacologic therapy for an average period of 10.5 months. Life style modification included diet and exercise counseling. Combination therapy included omega 3 fish oil (2000 mg/d), extended-release niacin (500-1000 mg/d), ezetimibe (10 mg/d), fenofibrate 160 mg/d and colesevelam HCI (1850 mg/d), as well as statins. The statins used were either simvastatin (20-40 mg/d) or rosuvastatin (5-20 mg/d). Sixty five percent (n = 161) received low to medium doses of simvastatin, whereas 35% (n = 87) received low to medium doses of rosuvastatin. Results: The study revealed a 32.5% reduction in mean Lp-PLA2 values (baseline 181.1 ± 41.5 vs 122.1 ± 28.1 ng/mL after treatment; P < .001). The change observed in LDL-C was 41%, (baseline 126.2 ± 43 vs 73.9 ± 37.7 mg/dL after treatment), which also was significant (P < .001). However, a Pearson correlation test analysis revealed only a weak positive association between changes in Lp-PLA2 and LDL-C (r2 = 0.052, P < .001). Conclusion: Lp-PLA2 is reduced with the use of life style counseling and combination lipid lowering therapy. Results also revealed that changes in Lp-PLA2 may be partially explained by the changes in LDL-C. © 2009 National Lipid Association.","Combination therapy; LDL-C; Low carbohydrate diet; Low saturated fat diet; Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub>; Niacin; Statin","antilipemic agent; apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein B; biological marker; cholesterol; colesevelam; ezetimibe; fenofibrate; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; nicotinic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; phospholipase A2; rosuvastatin; simvastatin; triacylglycerol; adult; aged; article; cholesterol blood level; diet therapy; dyslipidemia; exercise; female; human; lifestyle modification; lipoprotein blood level; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; patient counseling; priority journal; protein blood level; retrospective study; triacylglycerol blood level","","cholesterol, 57-88-5; colesevelam, 182815-43-6, 182815-44-7; ezetimibe, 163222-33-1; fenofibrate, 49562-28-9; nicotinic acid, 54-86-4, 59-67-6; phospholipase A2, 9001-84-7; rosuvastatin, 147098-18-8, 147098-20-2; simvastatin, 79902-63-9","","","","","Minino A.M., Heron M.P., Murphy S.L., Kochanek K.D., Deaths: final data for 2004, Natl Vital Stat Rep, 55, (2007); Kesteloot H., Sans S., Kromhout D., Dynamics of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in Western and Eastern Europe between 1970 and 2000, Eur Heart J, 27, pp. 107-113, (2006); Thom T., Haase N., Rosamond W., Et al., American Heart Association Statistics Committee and Stroke Statistics Subcommittee.

Mobile application plays a crucial role among smartphone users. It has gained enormous support from the smartphone users ranging from young to elder generations. It is very common to download and install desired mobile applications from application store to aid in completing particular tasks with ease. However, this behavior exposes user towards privacy risk as it has become a concern in smartphone usage. In this research, we propose a mathematical model named Privacy Risk Model (PRiMo) that measures the risk score of a user in smartphone usage. We are approaching the privacy issues in mobile applications from the individual's perspective. We conduct studies on different categories of mobile applications to determine the risk posed by the mobile applications. There is no standardization for residual risk. Therefore, by using the proposed model, we are exploring and creating a standardization for residual risk that becomes a benchmark for user to accept and live with that risk. © 2019 The Authors.","Mobile application; Privacy risk score; Residual risk; Sensitive data risk; Sensor","Behavioral research; Data privacy; Information systems; Information use; Mobile computing; Quality of service; Sensors; Smartphones; Standardization; Application stores; Data exposure; Mobile applications; Privacy preservation; Privacy risks; Quality of service model; Residual risk; Sensitive datas; Risk assessment","","","","","Ambient Intelligence Smart Home Automation using, (1001/PKOMP/8014003); University Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work is funded by a Research Grant provided by University Sains Malaysia.

Although the incidence of AMI has been decreasing in the US according to the American Heart Association, heart disease is still the leading cause of mortality in adults. In most cases of AMI and in a majority of cases of SCD, the underlying pathology is acute intraluminal coronary thrombus formation within an epicardial coronary artery leading to total or near-total acute coronary occlusion.

The existing OPAC platform acts as a search engine for reading materials in the library is commonly complicated and not user friendly. The Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is introduced in this project as part of a mobile application. NFC is a set of protocols on portable devices which perform wireless and contact-less short range, two-way communication between compatible devices. Transmission of data between devices is completed over radio waves and magnetic induction with passive NFC devices. As mobile devices, especially smartphones are more commonly utilized by users all around the world including university students, the proposed system would be able to enhance the performance of a library to be more convenient, secure, and more user friendly. Indirectly, the development of this mobile application can improve the visitation rates of students to the library by simplifying the searching, tracking reading materials and borrowing activities. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2018.","Android-based application; Library system; Mobile application; NFC technology; Smart university","Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Radio transmission; Search engines; Wireless telecommunication systems; Library systems; Mobile applications; Nfc technologies; Smart universities; The near field communication (NFC); Transmission of data; Two way communications; University students; Near field communication","","","","","","","Villen-Rueda L., Senso J.A., De Moya-Anegon F., The use of OPAC in a large academic library: A transactional log analysis study of subject searching, J Acad Librarianship, 33, 3, pp. 327-337, (2007); Arshad A., Shafique F., What do users prefer, card catalogue or OPAC?, A Study of Punjab University Library.

This concept, when applied in mobile crowd sensing, enables transfer of sensor data from blockchain clients to edge nodes. Edge nodes perform proof-of-work on sensor data from blockchain clients and append validated data to the chain. With this approach, blockchain can be performed pervasively. However, securing sensitive sensor data in a mobile blockchain (client/edge node architecture) becomes imperative. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated framework for mobile blockchain which ensures key agreement between clients and edge nodes using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman algorithm. Also, the framework provides efficient encryption of sensor data using the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm. Finally, key agreement processes in the framework were analyzed and results show that key pairing between the blockchain client and the edge node is a non-trivial process. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Edge computing; Internet of Things; Mining; Mobile crowd sensing; Sensor data encryption; Smart contract","Blockchain; Edge computing; Internet of things; Privacy-preserving techniques; Agreement problems; Block-chain; Data encryption; Diffie Hellman; Edge computing; Edge nodes; Key agreement; Mobile crowd sensing; Sensor data encryption; Sensors data; Smart contract","","","","","","","Capponi A., Et al., A cost-effective distributed framework for data collection in cloud-based mobile crowd sensing architectures, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing, 2, 1, pp. 3-16, (2017); Biswas K., Muthukkumarasamy V., Securing smart cities using blockchain technology. in High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City, IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS), 2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on.

Open RFID systems can only be effective if the systems can trust each other and be collaborative. The open system environment is also constantly evolving. So the trust and the collaborations need to be constantly maintained to cope with changes. RFID is becoming a ubiquitous computing technology imposing security and privacy threats. Counterfeiting in supply chain management is an attack with cloned andfraud RFID tags in order to gain illegal benefits. In this paper we will extend our previous work on a trust framework and construct a computational model for the trust management. The trust evaluation is built into the process of transactions of the data exchange and authorization in order to facilitate a better data sharing and access control. An example of wine counterfeiting will be presented and we will show how our computational trust model helps in reducingfraud brand of wines in supply chain management (SCM). ©2009 IEEE.","Computational Trust Management (CTM); RFID; Supply Chain Management (SCM); Trust Management (TM)","Access control; Logistics; Open systems; Radio navigation; Sensors; Supply chains; Ubiquitous computing; Wine; Wireless networks; Business workflows; Computational model; Computational trust; Computational trust model; Data exchange; Data Sharing; RF-ID tags; RFID systems; Security and privacy; Trust evaluation; Trust frameworks; Trust management; Ubiquitous computing technology; Supply chain management","","","","","","","Hic A., Michahelles F., Fleisch E., Dual Ownership: Access Management for Shared Item Information in RFlD-enabled Supply Chains, Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops, 2007.

It has unsupported features such as low latency, location awareness, and geographic distribution that are important for a few IoT applications. Fog computing is integrated into IoT to aid these features to increase computing, storage, and networking resources to the network edge. Unfortunately, it is faced with numerous security and privacy risks, raising severe concerns among users. Therefore, this research proposes a contextual risk-based access control model for Fog-IoT technology that considers real-time data information requests for IoT devices and gives dynamic feedback. The proposed model uses Fog-IoT environment features to estimate the security risk associated with each access request using device context, resource sensitivity, action severity, and risk history as inputs for the fuzzy risk model to compute the risk factor. Then, the proposed model uses a security agent in a fog node to provide adaptive features in which the device’s behaviour is monitored to detect any abnormal actions from authorised devices. The proposed model is then evaluated against the existing model to benchmark the results. The fuzzy-based risk assessment model with enhanced MQTT authentication protocol and adaptive security agent showed an accurate risk score for seven random scenarios tested compared to the simple risk score calculations. © 2022 by the authors.

However, IoT networks are still vulnerable to threats, attacks, intrusions, and other malicious activities. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that employ unsupervised learning techniques are used to secure sensitive data transmitted on IoT networks and preserve privacy. This paper proposes a hybrid model for intrusion detection that relies on a dimension reduction algorithm, an unsupervised learning algorithm, and a classifier. The proposed model employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features in a dataset. The K-means algorithm generates clusters that serve as class labels for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Experimental results using the NSL-KDD and the UNSW-NB15 datasets justify the effectiveness of our proposed model in detecting malicious activities in IoT networks. The proposed model, when trained, identifies benign and malicious behaviours using an unlabelled dataset. © 2021.

Trust concerns have been raised and the trustworthiness of social networking sites has been questioned. Currently, the trust in social networks is using the single- faceted approach, which is not well personalized, and doesn't account for the subjective views of trust according to each user, but only the general trust believes of a group of population. From our initial survey, we had found that most people can share their information without any doubts on OSN but they normally do not trust all their friends equally and think there is a need of trust management. By adopting the idea of multi-faceted trust model, a user-centric model that can personalize the comments/photos in social network with user's customized traits of trust is proposed. In this paper, the initial result is analyzed in determining the need to enhance the current trust model within the current social networking.","Multi-faceted model; Online social network (OSN); Privacy; Security; Trust; Trust management","Data privacy; Network security; Security of data; Websites; Online social networks (OSN); Personalizations; Security; Social networking sites; Trust; Trust in social networks; Trust management; User-centric modeling; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Johnston J., Eloff J.H.P., Labuschagne L., Security and human computer interfaces, Computers & Security, 22, 8, pp. 675-684, (2003); Zhang C., Sun J., Zhu X., Fang Y., Privacy and security for online social networks: Challenges and opportunities, Network, IEEE, 24, 4, (2010); Gunatilaka D., A Survey of Privacy and Security Issues in Social Networks, (2011); Brandtzaeg P.B., Liidersa M., Skjetnea J.H., Too many facebook ""friends""?

Higher education institutions also faced the same threat since BYOD has been adopted into their institution. In this paper, a simulation on watering hole attack and spear phishing; comparison between these two APT variants, as well as the survey design based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) are presented. The result of the survey is analyzed using PLS-SEM. The result demonstrated that severity factor and vulnerability factor moderately explained the Protection Behaviour factor; and Protection Behaviour factor is a moderately strong predictor to self-efficacy, but avoidance behavior does not predict self-efficacy directly. Based on this result, a set of security policy for hindering watering hole and spear phishing attack is designed and implemented. The new policy will then be adapted to the university e-learning portal. © 2018 The Authors.","Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD); Cyber Crime; Smartphone; Watering Hole","Crime; Education; Information systems; Surveys; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Bring your own devices; Cyber-crimes; Higher education institutions; Protection motivation theory; Security strategies; Vulnerability factors; Watering Hole; Computer crime","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) No : 203/PKOMP/6711424 of under the Universiti Sains Malaysia and Government of Malaysia.","Bichsel J., Dahlstrom E., Ecar Study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology, (2014); Bann L.L., Singh M.M., Samsudin A., Trusted security policies for tackling advanced persistent threat via spear phishing in byod environment, Procedia Computer Science, 72, pp. 129-136, (2015); Zulkei Z., Mahinderjit-Singh M., Malim N., AdvancedPersistentThreatMitigationUsingMultiLevelSecurity AccessControlFramework, Vol. 9158 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 90-105; Herath T., Rao H.R., Protection motivation and deterrence: A framework for security policy compliance in organisations, European Journal of Information Systems, 18, 2, pp. 106-125, (2009); Dang-Pham D., Pittayachawan S., Comparing intention to avoid malware across contexts in a byod-enabled Australian university: A protection motivation theory approach, Computers & Security, 48, pp. 281-297, (2015); Vance A., Siponen M., Pahnila S., Motivating is security compliance: Insights from habit and protection motivation theory, Information & Management, 49, 3, pp. 190-198, (2012); Pillay A., Diaki H., Nham E., Senanayake S., Tan G., Deshpande S., Does Byod Increase Risks or Drive Benefits?; La Polla M., Martinelli F., Sgandurra D., A survey on security for mobile devices, IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 15, 1, pp. 446-471, (2013); Krombholz K., Hobel H., Huber M., Weippl E., Advanced social engineering attacks, Journal of Information Security and Applications, 22, pp. 113-122, (2015); Spear-phishing Email: Most Favored Apt Attack Bait (Research Paper), (2012); Rogers R.W., A protection motivation theory of fear appeals and attitude change, The Journal of Psychology, 91, 1, pp. 93-114, (1975); Boer H., Seydel E.R., Protection Motivation Theory; Guel M.D., Information Security Policy Templates, (2010); CISCO, Byod in Education; the Cisco Bring-Your-Own-Device Solution for Education: Getting Mobile Devices Simply and Securely Connected; Emery S., Factors for Consideration When Developing A Bring Your Own Device (Byod) Strategy in Higher Education, (2012); Kline R.B., Book review: Psychometric theory, Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment, 17, 3, pp. 275-280, (1999); Damballa, Advanced Persistent Threats (Apt): A Brief Description; Roche X., Httrack Website Copier-Free Software Oine Browser (Gnu Gpl), (2007); Google, Google Url Shortener (N.d.); Kee C.K., Security policy roadmap-process for creating security policies, Sans Institute Electronic Library Available Online at Sourced on the 29th, Citeseer; Ladle D., Bring Your Own Device Policy Nottingham Trent University 1.0, 6, (2012)","M.M.

One attack that occurs is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). Attackers can manipulate a device’s behavior, applications, and services. Such manipulations lead to signification of a deviation from a known behavioral baseline for smartphones. In this study, the authors present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to provide a survey of the existing literature on APT defense mechanisms, find research gaps, and recommend future directions. The scope of this SLR covers a detailed analysis of most cybersecurity defense mechanisms and cutting-edge solutions. In this research, 112 papers published from 2011 until 2022 were analyzed. This review has explored different approaches used in cybersecurity and their effectiveness in defending against APT attacks. In a conclusion, we recommended a Situational Awareness (SA) model known as Observe–Orient–Decide–Act (OODA) to provide a comprehensive solution to monitor the device’s behavior for APT mitigation. © 2022 by the authors.

The existence of e-learning does contribute in the field of education field such as in the university because its improve the education quality and distributing and sharing of teaching material efficiently. However, due to the open-network in which e-learning tools resides, it is prone to various security attacks. In this paper, we will classify e-learning technology security based attacks into classification via active and passive attacks. Next, two major attacks which is the SQL injection attack and session hijacking is explored in-depth. Case study for each attack to investigate the vulnerabilities in e-learning system and mechanism of solutions to tackle this attack is also presented. An evaluation of the proposed solutions against the X.800 security architecture is done at the end of the study. © 2014 IEEE.","E-learning; Security; Session Hijacking; SQL injection; X.800 security architecture","E-learning; Network architecture; Network security; Wide area networks; E-learning technology; Education quality; Security; Security Architecture; Session Hijacking; SQL injection; Sql injection attacks; Teaching materials; Learning systems","","","","","","","Bojanc R., Blazic B.J., An economic modelling approach to information security risk management, International Journal of Information Management, 28, 5, pp. 413-422, (2008); Ngai E.W.T., Poon J.K.L., Chan Y.H.C., Empirical examination of the adoption of WebCT using TAM, Computers & Education, Elsevier, 48, pp. 250-267, (2007); Elissa K., Title of Paper if Known; Machado M., Tao E., Blackboard vs moodle: Comparing user experience of learning management systems, 37th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, (2007); Kumar S., Dutta K., Investigation on security in lms moodle, International Journal of Information Technology and Knowledge Management, 4, 1, pp. 233-238, (2011); Al-Ajlan A., Zedan H., Why moodle 12th IEEE international workshop on future trends of distributed computing systems, IEEE Computer Society, (2008); Al-Ibrahim M., Are our educational technology systems secured, International Journal for E-Learning Security (IJeLS), 1, 3-4, (2011); Ahuja A., Arora P., Singh S., Srivastava S., Kandasamy S., Preventing SQL injection attacks using Blowfish and RSA, Computer Science and Engineering, Elixir Comp.

APT attack has several variants of attacks such social engineering techniques via spear phishing, watering hole and whaling. APTGuard exhibits the ability to predict spear phishing URLs accurately using ensemble learning that combines decision tree and neural network. The URL is obtained from the SMS content received on the smart phones and sent to the server for filtering, classifying, logging and finally informing the administrator of the classification outcome. APTGuard can predict and detect APT from spear phishing but it does not have the ability of automated intervention on the user receiving the spear phishing URL. As a result, APTGuard is capable to extract the features of the URL and then classify it accordingly using ensemble learner which combines decision tree and neural network accurately. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Advanced persistent Threat (APT); Data mining; Ensemble learning; Neural network; Spear-phishing","Android (operating system); Computer crime; Decision trees; Fisheries; Forecasting; Information filtering; Neural networks; Smartphones; Advanced persistent Threat (APT); Android smartphone; Apt attacks; Ensemble learning; Social engineering; Spear phishing; Data mining","","","","","USM-Maxis; Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (304/PKOMP/650804/M151)","This work is supported by USM-Maxis Grant No: 304/PKOMP/650804/M151","Cyber Defense: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and Insider Threat, (2012); Tankard C., Advanced persistent threats and how to monitor and deter them, Network Security, 2011, 8, pp. 16-19, (2011); Anatomy of an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) Attack, (2016); Sood A.K., Enbody R.J., Targeted cyberattacks: A superset of advanced persistent threats, IEEE Security & Privacy, 11, 1, pp. 54-61, (2013); Lab K., Kaspersky Lab and Synerscope Join Forces to Battle Cyberthreats with Big Data Analytics; Krebsonsecurity; Best Defense against Spear-Phishing; Sans-Information Security Resources; Sans-Information Security Resources; Lin C.-H., Et al., Efficient Spear-Phishing Threat Detection Using Hypervisor Monitor, (2015); Research D., The Impact of Mobile Devices on Information Security: A Surveys of IT Professionals, Dimensional Research, (2013); Chen P., Desmet L., Huygens C., A Study on Advanced Persistent Threats. in IFIP International Conference on Communications and Multimedia Security, (2014); Mohammad R.M., Thabtah F., McCluskey L., Intelligent rule-based phishing websites classification, IET Information Security, 8, 3, pp. 153-160, (2014); Anatomy of an APT Attack: Step by Step Approach; Basnet R.B., Sung A.H., Liu Q., Rule-based phishing attack detection, Proceedings of the International Conference on Security and Management-Sam, (2011)","B.L.J.

Many of these devices rely on personal identification numbers (PIN) as a form of user authentication. One of the main concerns in the use of mobile devices is the possibility of a breach in security and privacy if the device is seized by an outside party. Threats can possibly come from friends as well as strangers. Smart devices can be easily lost due to their small size, thereby exposing details of users’ private lives. User behavior authentication is designed to overcome this problem by utilizing user behavioral techniques to continuously assess user identity. This study proposed a behavioral data profiling technique that utilizes data collected from the user behavior application to verify the identity of the user in a continuous manner. By utilizing a combination of analytical hierarchy process and correlation coefficient method, the best experimental results were obtained by verifying the identity of six types of user behaviors to determine the different behaviors. Based on the results, this study proposes a new authentication technique that enables verification of a user’s identity through their application usage in a transparent manner. Behavioral data profiling is designed in a modular manner that will not reject user access based on a single application activity but on several consecutive abnormal application usages to balance the trade-off between security and usability. The proposed framework is evaluated using a PIN-based technique and achieved an overall 95% confidence level. Behavioral data profiling provides a significant improvement in the security afforded to the device and user convenience. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Correlation coefficient; Decision-making; Security of smartphone; User behavior","Authentication; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Smartphones; Abnormal applications; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Authentication techniques; Correlation coefficient; Correlation coefficient method; Personal identification number; Security and usabilities; User behaviors; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Guo C., Wang H.J., Zhu W., Et al., Smart-phone attacks and defenses, Hotnets, (2004); Leavitt N., Malicious code moves to mobile devices, IEEE Comput, 33, 12, pp. 16-19, (2000); Dagon D., Martin T., Starner T., Mobile phones as computing devices: The viruses are coming!, IEEE Pervasive Comput, 3, 4, pp. 11-15, (2004); Li Q., Clark G., Mobile security: A look ahead, IEEE Secur.

Furthermore, RFID data nature characteristics faces the issues likes RFID just carry simple information, in-flood of data, inaccuracy data from RFID readers and difficulties to track spatial and place. We propose to use clustering algorithms in order to detect counterfeit in supply chain management. We will apply various clustering algorithms to analyzed and determine every attribute in the dataset structure pattern. Based on evaluation that have done, we found that Farthest First is the best algorithm for 1000 (small data) and 10000 (bigger data). However, the values of false negative in data still quite high and it is dangerous if RFID scanner misread the cloned or fraud tags become genuine tags. Hence, we applied cost algorithms to reduce false negative values.","Clustering algorithms; Counterfeiting; Radio Frequency Identification (RFID); Supply Chain Management (SCM); Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA)","Algorithms; Chains; Cloning; Crime; Electromagnetic waves; Information management; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Radio waves; Supply chain management; Counterfeiting; False negatives; Knowledge analysis; Radio frequencies; RFID-enabled supply chains; Simple informations; Supply chain managements (SCM); Wireless devices; Clustering algorithms","","","","","","","Mahinderjit-Singh M., Li X., Li Z., A cost-based model for risk management in rfid-enabled supply chain applications, Supply Chain Management, pp. 201-236, (2011); Singh M.M., Li X., Li Z., Security and privacy protection in RFID-enabled supply chain management, International Journal of Radio Frequency Identification Technology and Applications, 3-4, pp. 294-318, (2011); Mahinderjit-Singh M., Li X., Trust in RFID-enabled supply-chain management, International Journal of Security and Networks, 5, 2, pp. 96-105, (2010); Derakhshan R., Orlowska M.E., Li X., RFID Data Management: Challenges and Opportunities, (2007); Gao X., Xiang Z., Wang H., Shen J., Huang J., Song S., An Approach to Security and Privacy of RFID System for Supply Chain, (2004); Chao C.-C., Yang J.-M., Jen W.-Y., Determining technology trends and forecasts of RFID by a historical review and bibliometric analysis from 1991 to 2005, Technovation, 27, 5, pp. 268-279, (2007); Mehrjerdi Y.Z., RFID-enabled supply chain systems with computer simulation, Assembly Automation, 29, 2, pp. 174-183, (2009); Michael K., McCathie L., The Pros and Cons of RFID in Supply Chain Management, (2005); Han J., Gonzalez H., Li X., Klabjan D., Warehousing and Mining Massive RFID Data Sets, (2006); Mirowski L., Hartnett J., Deckard: A system to detect change of RFID tag ownership, International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 7, 7, pp. 89-98, (2007); Lehtonen M., Michahelles F., Fleisch E., Probabilistic Approach for Location-based Authentication, (2007); Bagirov A., Rubinov A., Soukhoroukova N., Yearwood J., Unsupervised and supervised data classification via nonsmooth and global optimization, Top, 11, 1, pp. 1-75, (2003); Singh M.M., Teen L.M., RFID-enabled Supply Chain Simulator for Counterfeiting Attack Detection, (2014); Sikander J., RFID Enabled Retail Supply Chain, (2007); Moon T.K., The expectation-maximization algorithm.

However, female patients often feel reluctant and embarrassed about meeting physicians in person to discuss their intimate body parts, and prefer to use social media for such interactions. Indeed, the number of patients and physicians interacting and seeking information related to breast cancer on social media has been growing. However, a physician may behave inappropriately on social media by sharing a patient's personal medical data excessively with colleagues or the public. Such an act would reduce the physician's trustworthiness from the patient's perspective. The multifaceted trust model is currently most commonly used for investigating social media interactions, which facilitates its enhanced adoption in the context of breast self-examination. The characteristics of the multifaceted trust model go beyond being personalized, context-dependent, and transitive. This model is more user-centric, which allows any user to evaluate the interaction process. Thus, in this study, we explored and evaluated use of the multifaceted trust model for breast self-examination as a more suitable trust model for patient-physician social media interactions in breast cancer screening. Objective: The objectives of this study were: (1) to identify the trustworthiness indicators that are suitable for a breast self-examination system, (2) design and propose a breast self-examination system, and (3) evaluate the multifaceted trustworthiness interaction between patients and physicians. Methods: We used a qualitative study design based on open-ended interviews with 32 participants (16 outpatients and 16 physicians). The interview started with an introduction to the research objective and an explanation of the steps on how to use the proposed breast self-examination system. The breast self-examination system was then evaluated by asking the patient to rate their trustworthiness with the physician after the consultation. The evaluation was also based on monitoring the activity in the chat room (interactions between physicians and patients) during daily meetings, weekly meetings, and the articles posted by the physician in the forum. Results: Based on the interview sessions with 16 physicians and 16 patients on using the breast self-examination system, honesty had a strong positive correlation (r=0.91) with trustworthiness, followed by credibility (r=0.85), confidence (r=0.79), and faith (r=0.79). In addition, belief (r=0.75), competency (r=0.73), and reliability (r=0.73) were strongly correlated with trustworthiness, with the lowest correlation found for reputation (r=0.72). The correlation among trustworthiness indicators was significant (P<.001). Moreover, the trust level of a patient for a particular physician was found to increase after several interactions. Conclusions: Multifaceted trustworthiness has a significant impact on a breast self-examination system. Evaluation of trustworthiness indicators helps to ensure a trustworthy system and ethical interaction between a patient and physician. A new patient can obtain a consultation by referring to the best physician according to preference of other patients. Patients can also trust a physician based on another patient's recommendation regarding the physician's trust level. The correlation analysis further showed that the most preferred trustworthiness indicator is honesty.  © 2020 Rajes Khana, Manmeet Mahinderjit Singh, Faten Damanhoori, Norlia Mustaffa.","Breast cancer; Breast self-examination; Health care system; Multifaceted trust; Social media; Trust; Trustworthiness","","","","","","","","Bray F, Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Siegel RL, Torre LA, Jemal A., Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries, CA Cancer J Clin, 68, 6, pp. 394-424, (2018); Pusat Data Dan Informasi Kementrian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia, (2015); Longe JL, The Gale encyclopedia of cancer: a guide to cancer and its treatments, (2005); Roth MY, Elmore JG, Yi-Frazier JP, Reisch LM, Oster NV, Miglioretti DL., Self-detection remains a key method of breast cancer detection for U.S. women, J Womens Health (Larchmt), 20, 8, pp. 1135-1139, (2011); Miller AB, Baines CJ., The role of clinical breast examination and breast self-examination, Prev Med, 53, 3, pp. 118-120, (2011); Juanita J, Piyanuch J, Umaporn B., BSE practice and BSE self-efficacy among Nursing Students in Aceh, Indonesia, Nurse Media J Nurs, 3, 1, pp. 557-568, (2013); Hassan LM, Mahmoud N, Miller AB, Iraj H, Mohsen M, Majid J, Et al., Evaluation of effect of self-examination and physical examination on breast cancer, Breast, 24, 4, pp. 487-490, (2015); Sujindra E, Elamurugan T., Knowledge, attitude, and practice of breast self-examination in female nursing students, Int J Educ Psychol Res, 1, 2, (2015); Modahl M, Tompsett L, Moorhead T., Doctors, Patients & Social Media, (2011); Thompson LA, Dawson K, Ferdig R, Black EW, Boyer J, Coutts J, Et al., The intersection of online social networking with medical professionalism, J Gen Intern Med, 23, 7, pp. 954-957, (2008); Hale TM, Pathipati AS, Zan S, Jethwani K., Representation of health conditions on Facebook: content analysis and evaluation of user engagement, J Med Internet Res, 16, 8, (2014); Attai DJ, Cowher MS, Al-Hamadani M, Schoger JM, Staley AC, Landercasper J., Twitter Social Media is an Effective Tool for Breast Cancer Patient Education and Support: Patient-Reported Outcomes by Survey, J Med Internet Res, 17, 7, (2015); Denecke K, Bamidis P, Bond C, Gabarron E, Househ M, Lau AYS, Et al., Ethical Issues of Social Media Usage in Healthcare, Yearb Med Inform, 10, 1, pp. 137-147, (2015); Fisher J, Clayton M., Who gives a tweet: assessing patients' interest in the use of social media for health care, Worldviews Evid Based Nurs, 9, 2, pp. 100-108, (2012); Fox S., The Social Life of Health Information, (2011); White M, Dorman S., Receiving social support online: implications for health education, Health Educ Res, 16, 6, pp. 693-707, (2001); Kemp S., Digital in 2018: World?s internet users pass the 4 billion mark; Brown J, Ryan C, Harris A., How doctors view and use social media: a national survey, J Med Internet Res, 16, 12, (2014); Chretien KC, Kind T., Social media and clinical care: ethical, professional, and social implications, Circulation, 127, 13, pp. 1413-1421, (2013); Lagu T, Kaufman EJ, Asch DA, Armstrong K., Content of weblogs written by health professionals, J Gen Intern Med, 23, 10, pp. 1642-1646, (2008); Chretien KC, Farnan JM, Greysen SR, Kind T., To friend or not to friend?

This paper discusses a readability issues in privacy policies and how privacy scholars approach the issue. The paper also compares and analyzes research results on readability measurement of privacy policies and divides them into two categories according to different perspective. The perspective includes readability measurement from reader's perspective and readability measurement from privacy policies text content’s perspective. Our finding shows that website providers should give consumers better control regarding their information and give them more freedom in privacy policies. Only then will consumers become liberated from the burden of choosing between 2 unspeakable options. A legally binding document on the privacy policy can be written, that will also be clear and simple to read. © 2020 SERSC.","Information privacy; Privacy; Privacy Policies; Readability; Security","","","","","","","","Acquisti A., Gross R., ).

Trust needs to be facilitated into OSNs, to provide users with the necessary tools and much desired freedom to express their subjective views of trust just like in the offline world. In this paper, we identify a number of privacy and security issues as well as challenges of trust within the context of OSN.

Diet influences serum lipoproteins and total cholesterol concentration has been known for years. Numerous dietary strategies have been proposed that claimed to be best for the reducing the coronary heart disease risk. Initially, the national dietary recommendation was mainly focused on a reduction in fat intake. In common man's mind, the word ""dietary fat"" was embedded as synonymous with obesity and heart disease, where as the word ""low fat"" and ""fat free"" were taken as synonymous with heart health. This lead to a huge switch over to the consumption of fat free or low fat foods rich in high amounts of refined carbohydrates and sugar. However, paradoxically, such dietary recommendations over the years resulted in the increased prevalence of unintended health consequences like obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are known to increase the risk for coronary heart disease. Thus, indicating that the replacement of fats with carbohydrates to reduce heart disease was based on little scientific evidence and much less attention was given to the expected degree of risk reduction. It is now also increasingly appreciated that different fats have different health effects and total fat intake does not increase cardiovascular disease risk. For instance, results from many epidemiological and controlled clinical trials have indicated that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fats is more effective in reducing the cardiovascular disease risk than simply reducing total fat consumption. In this chapter, we discuss the epidemiological evidence and dietary intervention controlled studies regarding the relationship of fats, carbohydrates and risk of coronary heart disease with particular emphasis on, "" Is a low saturated fat, low carbohydrate diet a strategy to reduce coronary heart disease risk""? © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Quintao E., Grundy S.M., Ahrens Jr E.H., Effects of dietary cholesterol on the regulation of total body cholesterol in man, J.

Various APT attack vectors exist, including social engineering techniques such as spear phishing, watering holes, SQL injection, and application repackaging. Various sensors and services are essential for a smartphone to assist in user behavior that involves sensitive information. Resultantly, smartphones have become the main target of APT attacks. Due to the vulnerability of smartphone sensors, several challenges have emerged, including the inadequacy of current methods for detecting APTs. Nevertheless, several existing APT solutions, strategies, and implementations have failed to provide comprehensive solutions. Detecting APT attacks remains challenging due to the lack of attention given to human behavioral factors contributing to APTs, the ambiguity of APT attack trails, and the absence of a clear attack fingerprint. In addition, there is a lack of studies using game theory or fuzzy logic as an artificial intelligence (AI) strategy for detecting APT attacks on smartphone sensors, besides the limited understanding of the attack that may be employed due to the complex nature of APT attacks. Accordingly, this study aimed to deliver a systematic review to report on the extant research concerning APT detection for mobile sensors, applications, and user behavior. The study presents an overview of works performed between 2012 and 2023. In total, 1351 papers were reviewed during the primary search. Subsequently, these papers were processed according to their titles, abstracts, and contents. The resulting papers were selected to address the research questions. A conceptual framework is proposed to incorporate the situational awareness model in line with adopting game theory as an AI technique used to generate APT-based tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and normal TTPs and cognitive decision making. This framework enhances security awareness and facilitates the detection of APT attacks on smartphone sensors, applications, and user behavior. It supports researchers in exploring the most significant papers on APTs related to mobile sensors, services, applications, and detection techniques using AI. © 2023 by the authors.","cyber cognitive situational awareness (CCSA); game theory; Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL); MITRE framework; spear phishing; user behavior","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/ICT07/USM/02/2)","This work is supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with project Code: FRGS/1/2020/ICT07/USM/02/2.","Berrada G., Cheney J., Benabderrahmane S., Maxwell W., Mookherjee H., Theriault A., Wright R., A baseline for unsupervised advanced persistent threat detection in system-level provenance, Future Gener.

The modeling method is an empirical formula for measuring individual actor's level of involvement in terrorism crime. Terrorists are gaining ground virtually in the most nation of the world. This has become a global challenge as the attacks have recorded millions of deaths of innocent people, incapacitated people, and destroyed properties. In addition, the attacks rendered most communities and countries economically dormant and create a complex crisis among the people. In the research approach, the mathematical model developed is used to detect person's involvement in terrorism. Furthermore, the mathematical model result can be used to predict or calculate the outcome of the dependent parameter from the varying independents. In conclusion, the research objectives were achieved as there was a record of 0.26495 or 26.495% prediction on the overall test which determined the levels of optimization and improvement. Thus, we recommend that people's profiling analysis has a significant contribution to terrorist detecting if integrated into the system as a solution to terrorist attacks. © 2018 Newswood Limited.

To date, there are various types of attendance systems that are applying different technologies such as biometrics, tokens and sensors such as RFID. The latest is by applying near-field communication (NFC), a sensor within the smartphone has been used as a mean for recording attendances. The aim of this paper is to list out the possible security attacks against NFC (Near Field Communication) enabled systems by focusing on a student-based attendance system. A brief overview over NFC technology and discussion on various security attacks against NFC in different media is presented. Overall, an attendance system is compromised mainly by tag swapping, tag cloning and manipulation of data occurring on the NFC device and operational server. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Attendance system; Mitigations; Near Field Communication (NFC); Security attack","Artificial intelligence; Mobile telecommunication systems; Students; Attendance systems; Mitigations; Nfc technologies; Security attacks; Security challenges; Student-based; Tag swapping; The near field communication (NFC); Near field communication","","","","","","","Ozdenizci B., Aydin M., Coskun V., Kerem O.K., NFC Research Framework: A Literature Review and Future Research Directions; Madlmayr G., Langer J., Scharinger J., Kantner C., NFC Devices: Security and Privacy, The Third International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security; Francis L., Hancke G., Mayes K., Markantonakis K., Practical NFC peer-to-peer relay attack using mobile phones, Rfidsec 2010.

However, there are several drawbacks to this approach, one of which is the risks resulted from the occurrence of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). The goal of APT is to exfiltrate and leak important and sensitive corporate information through exploitation of vulnerabilities within BYOD environment. This paper addresses the APT issue via spear phishing attacks within BYOD environment, through the mediation provided by security policies. The devising of Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security policies using ACPT includes the implementation of environment attributes along with the specification of proposed policy rules for organizations is proven to be the most suitable policy mechanism for BYOD environment. Guidelines in mitigating APT via spear phishing are briefly discussed as well. © 2015 The Authors.","Access Control Policy Tool (ACPT); OWASP risk rating methodology; Security policy; Spear Phishing","Computer crime; Data handling; Information systems; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Security systems; Access control policies; Bring your own devices; Corporate information; Mandatory access control; Policy mechanisms; Risk ratings; Security policy; Spear phishing; Access control","","","","","","","Mahinderjit Singh M., Et al., Security Attacks Taxonomy on Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD) Model, International Journal of Mobile, Network, Communication and Telematics (IJMNCT), (2014); Pillay A., Diaki H., Nham E., Senanayake S., Tan G., Deshpande S., Does BYOD Increase Risks or Drive Benefits?; Li F., A Detailed Analysis of An Advanced Persistent Threat Malware; Advanced Persistent Threats and Other Advanced Attacks White Paper, (2011); Leavitt N., Todays Mobile Security Requires a New Approach, IEEE Computer Society Press Los Alamitos, (2013); Advanced Persistence Threats: A Decade in Review, (2011); Kim S., Cho D., Yeo S., Secure Model against APT in m-Connected SCADA Network, International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, 2014, (2014); Wrinkler V.J.R., Data Security in Cloud Computing - Part 3 Cloud Data Protection Methods; Coyne E., Weil T.R., ABAC and RBAC: Scalable, flexible, and auditable access management, IT Professional, 15, 3, pp. 0014-16, (2013); Muthukumaran D., Schiffman J., Hassanm M., Sawani A., Rao V., Jaeger T., Protecting the Integrity of Trusted Applications in Mobile Phone Systems, Security and Communication Networks, Security Comm.

As the adoption of WT accelerates and a new level of functionality is introduced, it could potentially open the door to new threats to sensitive information and activities. The study shows that both passive attacks (eavesdropping on the wireless communication) and active attacks (man-in-the-middle attack and replay attack) can be successfully launched by exploiting the security vulnerability of the wearable such as lack of user authentication. Hence, a strong user authentication is required to create trust relationships between users and services and protect users’ data. In this research, a novel authentication protocol using enhanced out-of-band (e-OOBA) two-factor biometric authentication for wearable devices is introduced. The new authentication scheme is known as out-of-band biometrics authentication (OOB-BA) is capable to provide better security and minimize information leakage. The security measurements on this scheme are evaluated and benchmarked. One main finding from security analysis demonstrate that OOB-BA is able to mitigate the security risks such as impersonation attacks leading to stand as an alternative authentication model to be used in future WT adoption. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biometric; out-of-band; security vulnerabilities and attacks; two-factor authentication; Wearable technology","Biometrics; Network security; Risk assessment; Security systems; Wearable technology; Authentication protocols; Biometric authentication; Biometrics authentication; Man in the middle attacks; Out of band; Security vulnerabilities; Two factor authentication; Wireless communications; Authentication","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8014003)","This work was supported by University Sains Malaysia [grant number: 1001/PKOMP/8014003].","Tehrani K., Michael A.; (2015); Barr S.J., Shin E., Kinghorn R., Et al.; Al-Muhtadi J., Mickunas D., Campbell R.; McAdams E., Krupaviciute A., Gehin C., Et al.; Di Pietro R., Mancini L.V., Security and privacy issues of handheld and wearable wireless devices, Commun ACM, 46, 9, pp. 74-79, (2003); Uddin M., Salem A., Nam I., Et al.; Riverra J., Meulen R.V.D.; Madakam S., Ramaswamy R., Tripathi S., Internet of things (IoT): a literature review, J Comput Commun, 3, 5, pp. 164-173, (2015); Sachs G.; Ghosal P.; Agrawal S., Das M.L.; Zhao K., Ge L.; Priyanka E.A.M.; Gimhae G.-N., Six human factors to acceptability of wearable computers, Int J Multimedia Ubiquitous Eng, 8, 3, pp. 103-114, (2013); Beal V.C., (2015); Sanger D.E., Perlroth N.; Page C.; Cyr B., Horn W., Miao D., Et al., Security analysis of wearable fitness devices (fitbit), (2014); Hale M.L., Et al.; Rogers M.; Clausing E., Schiefer M., Morgenstern M., Internet of things: security evaluation of nine fitness trackers.

RFID supply chain performance can be enhanced by integrating RFID functions into the web service paradigm. However, the use of RFID involves growing privacy and security concerns, in part because the lack of RFID tag capacity places the whole supply-chain loop at risk of security such as product counterfeiting. In this paper, we tackle the security and privacy challenges in RFID by using context-aware web service technology. By employing a seven-layer trust framework, we design the functionalities to comply with web service architecture. In order to address the security and privacy problems, we also use the context parameters such as location and time to model the situations of RFID tags. A complete case of RFID-enabled supply chain in an EPCglobal network using context-aware web services is provided to tackle the RFID security and privacy challenges.

Six-Sigma is a quality improvement approach that aims to reduce the number of defects up to 3.4 parts per million. In the last three decades, it helped several companies to enhance the capability of their processes and to increase the level of quality of their product or service. This case study based research deals with application of DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) methodology of Six-Sigma to reduce the machine downtime for process improvement. The tools and techniques used during the analysis are Process Mapping (SIPOC Diagram), Process Flow Chart, Process Capability Analysis, Histogram, Pareto Chart, Pie Chart, Cause and Effect Diagram, Brainstorming, Affinity Diagram and ANOVA. The results of this study show that sigma value has improved from 2.79-2.85 Sigma. This study also highlighted the five critical problems (reasons) of downtime which are, i.e., electricity problem, shortage of material, quality issues, machine fault and reactive maintenance. The valuable principles and practices of Six-Sigma will do well by continuously refining the organizational culture. Time and commitment both are required and compulsory to bring change in cultural before they are strongly implanted into the organization. I do assure that this research study will provide opportunities to the organizations for the better implementation of Six-Sigma projects. © Medwell Journals, 2016.","Organizational culture; Process improvement; Project management; Quality; Six-Sigma","","","","","","","","Al-Sagheer A., Applying Six-Sigma to achieve enterprise sustainability: preparations and aftermath of Six-Sigma projects, J.

However, advanced persistent threats (APTs) pose a significant danger to the current contemporary way of life, and effective APT detection and defense are vital. Game theory is one of the most sought-after approaches adopted against APTs, providing a framework for understanding and analyzing the strategic interactions between attackers and defenders. However, what are the most recent developments in game theory frameworks against APTs, and what approaches and contexts are applied in game theory frameworks to address APTs? In this systematic literature review, 48 articles published between 2017 and 2022 in various journals were extracted and analyzed according to PRISMA procedures and our formulated research questions. This review found that game-theory approaches have been optimized for the defensive performance of security measures and implemented to anticipate and prepare for countermeasures. Many have been designed as part of incentive-compatible and welfare-maximizing contracts and then applied to cyber–physical systems, social networks, and transportation systems, among others. The trends indicate that game theory provides the means to analyze and understand complex security scenarios based on technological advances, changes in the threat landscape, and the emergence of new trends in cyber-crime. In this study, new opportunities and challenges against APTs are outlined, such as the ways in which tactics and techniques to bypass defenses are likely to evolve in order to evade detection, and we focused on specific industries and sectors of high interest or value (e.g., healthcare, finance, critical infrastructure, and the government). © 2023 by the authors.","attacks; behavior; cybersecurity; mobile; network security; smartphone; systematic review; trend","","","","","","Entertainment Science; International Research Center; Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, JAIST; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/ICT07/USM/02/2)","This work is supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with project Code: FRGS/1/2020/ICT07/USM/02/2.

The mobile device flexibility has encouraged users to turn their mobile devices into primary hubs for storing information. This paper adopts the classical CW-Lite security models as the framework and the human behavioral patterns as the context. The selected behavioral aspects refer to mobile application and mobility, deployed as major characteristics that determine security control decisions. This proposed paper requires the application of human behavioral context on mobile phones. The solution involves the novel use of behavioral aspects to improve the security of mobile phones. Two important scenarios are incorporated: analytic hierarchy process (AHP) mobile application and AHP mobility. The proposed methodology is superior because it can detect the change in the user behavior in comparison with an intruder. The applied intelligent human behavioral context on the CW-Lite model shows the advantages of AHP in detecting the changes in the user behavior and in authenticating the identity of the main user. These advantages ensure reliability and security of the phone. © 2015 The Authors.","Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for decision making; CW-Lite security model; User authentication","Analytic hierarchy process; Authentication; Cellular telephones; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Information systems; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Social sciences; Telephone sets; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Behavioral patterns; Mobile app; Mobile applications; Security controls; Security model; User authentication; User behaviors; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Liu Z., Hong Y., Pi D., A large-scale study of web password habits of chinese network users, Journal of Software, 9, 2, pp. 293-297, (2014); Liu T., Bahl P., Chlamtac I., Mobility modeling, location tracking, and trajectory prediction in wireless atm networks, Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on, 16, 6, pp. 922-936, (1998); Bajaj R., Ranaweera S.L., Agrawal D.P., Gps: Location-tracking technology, Computer, 35, 4, pp. 92-94, (2002); Song C., Qu Z., Blumm N., Barabasi A.-L., Limits of predictability in human mobility, Science, 327, 5968, pp. 1018-1021, (2010); Phithakkitnukoon S., Horanont T., Di Lorenzo G., Shibasaki R., Ratti C., Activity-aware map: Identifying human daily activity pattern using mobile phone data, Human Behavior Understanding, Springer, pp. 14-25, (2010); Bigun J., Fierrez-Aguilar J., Ortega-Garcia J., Gonzalez-Rodriguez J., Combining biometric evidence for person authentication, Advanced Studies in Biometrics, Springer, pp. 1-18, (2005); Dinh H.T., Lee C., Niyato D., Wang P., A survey of mobile cloud computing: Architecture, applications, and approaches, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 13, 18, pp. 1587-1611, (2013); Brosso I., La Neve A., Adaptive Security Policy Using User Behavior Analysis and Human Elements of Information Security, (2012); Barnes-Holmes D., Barnes-Holmes Y., Cullinan V., Relational frame theory and skinner's verbal behavior: A possible synthesis, The Behavior Analyst, 23, 1, (2000); Shankar U., Jaeger T., Sailer R., Toward automated information-flow integrity verification for security-critical applications, NDSS, (2006); Muthukumaran D., Schiffman J., Hassan M., Sawani A., Rao V., Jaeger T., Protecting the integrity of trusted applications in mobile phone systems, Security and Communication Networks, 4, 6, pp. 633-650, (2011); Saaty T., The Analytic Hierarchy Process (Ahp) for Decision Making, (1980); Jusoh Y.Y., Chamili K., Pa N.C., Yahaya J.H., Open source software selection using an analytical hierarchy process (ahp), American Journal of Software Engineering and Applications, 3, 6, pp. 83-89, (2014); Sharma M.J., Moon I., Bae H., Analytic hierarchy process to assess and optimize distribution network, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 202, 1, pp. 256-265, (2008)","","Bordea G.","Elsevier","Intelligent Control Technology Association; Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science (SIAT-CAS); The Society of Digital Information and Wireless Communications (SDIWC)","3rd Information Systems International Conference, 2015","16 April 2015 through 18 April 2015","Shenzhen","123178","18770509","","","","English","Procedia Comput.

Despite its opportunities and advantages over traditional wireless sensor networks, mobile crowd sensing still faces security and privacy issues, among other challenges. Specifically, the security and privacy of sensitive location information of users remain lingering issues, considering the ""on"" and ""off"" state of global positioning system sensor in smartphones. To address this problem, this paper proposes ""SenseCrypt"", a framework that automatically annotates and signcrypts sensitive location information of mobile crowd sensing users. The framework relies on K-means algorithm and a certificateless aggregate signcryption scheme (CLASC). It incorporates spatial coding as the data compression technique and message query telemetry transport as the messaging protocol. Results presented in this paper show that the proposed framework incurs low computational cost and communication overhead. Also, the framework is robust against privileged insider attack, replay and forgery attacks. Confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation are security services offered by the proposed framework.","data annotation; data compression; Internet of Things; message queuing telemetry transport protocol; mobile crowd sensing; security and privacy; signcryption","","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","14248220","","","32526843","English","Sensors (Basel)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086354703"

Methods: This was a single-center, multiple-user trial. Four hundred and two patients undergoing possible or definite percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were randomized 1:1 to an 18-gauge versus a 21-gauge needle. Patients and personnel pulling the sheaths and performing the follow-up were blinded. The primary end point was a composite of access bleeding. Events were tabulated following sheath removal, ≤24 h after the procedure and at the follow-up (at 1-2 weeks). End points were blindly adjudicated. Results: The event rate overall was 12.4% and did not differ significantly between groups, although the 21-gauge needle was found to reduce events by more than one third. An exploratory subgroup analysis of prespecified variables indicated that: patients who did not undergo PCI or elective procedures, female patients and those with a final sheath size of ≤6 Fr all had a significant or near-significant reduction of complications with Micropuncture. Conclusions: Although no significant differences between the use of the 18- and 21-gauge needles were observed, there was a 50-75% reduction with Micropuncture in several subgroups. The study was terminated prematurely. Access site complications may be reduced by the use of the 21-gauge needle, particularly when the risk of bleeding is not high. Further multicenter data will be required to confirm these hypothesis-generating observations. © 2014 S.

This supply-chain environment can only be effective if the partners can trust each other and be collaborative. Besides that, counterfeiting is a challenging issue in RFID Supply-Chain Management (SCM). On the basis of the analysis of traditional trust framework in SCM, this paper proposes a seven-layer RFID trust framework. An example of integration of our trust framework with SCM systems is presented. Taxonomy of cloning threats and solutions is also presented.

The relationship between the environmental and human factors of this model is not well investigated in the smart home domain. Moreover, the difficulties on collecting feedback of personal thermal sensation, especially neutral comfort, and the requirements of data size can lead to the failure of thermal comfort system to fulfill the individual's comfort preference. In this paper, we present an incomplete supervised learning method for an enhanced PTC model to be more personalized to predict real-Time personal thermal sensation in Cyber-Physical Human Centric System. In particular, the psychological parameters are always available for the continuous satisfactory control of a heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in a timely manner. In the enhanced PTC model, we propose a personalized predictive classifier (PPC), which uses a learning algorithm from incomplete supervision to predict the personal thermal sensation. We also explore the PPC that uses two cascaded Random Forest classifiers can result a better performance and a faster learning speed in the implementation of energy efficient thermal comfort control (EETCC) system to improve individual's thermal comfort level while optimizing the HVAC energy consumption at the same time. Through the experiment and evaluation studies, we conclude that the enhanced PTC model with PPC is able to offer psychological parameters inference to a continuous satisfactory control system in smart homes. © 2022 IEEE.","Cyber-Physical Systems; Personal Thermal Comfort; Smart Homes; Supervised Learning Method","Automation; Cyber Physical System; Decision trees; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Forecasting; HVAC; Learning algorithms; Supervised learning; Thermal comfort; Cyber physicals; Data size; Home domain; Human-centric; Personal thermal comfort; Satisfactory control; Smart homes; Supervised learning methods; Thermal comfort models; Thermal sensations; Intelligent buildings","","","","","","","Lim Y., Ooi S.E., Makino Y., Teo T.K., Alfred R., Tan Y., Implementation of energy efficient thermal comfort control for cyber-physical home systems, J. of Comput. and Theoretical Nanoscience, 12, 11, pp. 11530-11534, (2017); Fanger P.O., Thermal Comfort: Analysis and Applications in Environmental Engineering, Copenhagen: Danish Technical Press, (1970); Liu S., Schiavon S., Prasanna Das H., Jin M., Spanos C.J., Personal thermal comfort models with wearable sensors, Building and Environment, 162, (2019); Harper R., Inside the Smart Home, (2003); Lee E.A., The past, present and future of cyber-physical systems: A focus on models, Sensors, 15, 3, pp. 4837-4869, (2015); Fang Y., Lim Y., Ooi S.E., Zhou C., Tan Y., Study of human thermal comfort for cyber-physical human centric system in smart homes, Sensors, 20, 2, (2020); Kim J., Zhou Y., Schiavon S., Raftery P., Brager G., Personal comfort models: Predicting individuals? thermal preference using occupant heating and cooling behavior and machine learning, Building and Environment, 129, pp. 96-106, (2018); Matsumoto S., ECHONET: A home network standard, IEEE Pervasive Computing, 9, 3, pp. 88-92, (2010); Myers J.L., Well A.D., Research Design and Statistical Analysis, 2nd Ed.

Security warning is designed to warn the users such as notify, inform and advice users about the consequence effect of an action. However, computer user s tend to ignore security warning due to the lack of attentions, did not understand the meaning of the warnings, difficulties on the technical jargon used, lack of motivation and users become habituated to security warning. Therefore, a survey was mounted online utilising 156 participants to investigate and to understand further general understanding of user's perceptions on security warnings. This paper describes two main findings utilising Chi-Square and Cramer's V test. The findings suggested that in all three scenarios, the results were not statistically significant. However, results portrayed in Cramer's V test were in a better outlook. The result indicates on the need to look closely on each variable involves within the study sampling to improve the security warnings. © 2018 The Authors.","Chi Square; Cramer's V Test; Human Computer Interaction; Security Warning; Usability; Usable Security","Information systems; Surveys; Chi Square; Computer users; End users; Security warning; Technical jargon; Usability; Usable security; User's perceptions; Human computer interaction","","","","","","","Zaaba Z.F., Enhancing Usability Using Automated Security Interface Adaption (Asia), (2014); Bravo-Lillo C.A., Improving Computer Security Dialogs: An Exploration of Attention and Habituation, (2014); Microsoft,Warning Messages, (2015); Wu M., Miller C.R., Garfinkel S.L., Do Security Toolbars Actually Prevent Phishing Attacks, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference of Human Factors in Computing System, pp. 601-610, (2006); Seifert C., Welch I., Komisarczuk P., Effectiveness of Security by Admonition: A Case Study of Security Warnings in A W Eb Browser Setting, (2006); Sharek D., Swofford C., Wogalter M., Failure to Recognize Fake Internet Pop Up Warning Message, Proceeding of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 52nd Annual Meeting, pp. 557-580, (2008); Sunshine J., Egelmen S., Almuhimedi H., Atri N., Cranor L.F., Crying Wolf: An empirical study of ssl warning effectiveness, Proceedings of the 18th Conference on USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 229-416, (2009); Egelmen S., Trust Me: Design Patterns for Constructions Trustworthy Trust Indicators, (2009); Furnell S.M., Jusoh A., Katsabas A., The challenge of understanding and using security: A survey of end -users, Computer and Security, the International Source of Innovation for the Innovation Security and IT Audit Pr Ofessional, (2006); Zaaba Z.F., Teo K.B., Examination on usability issues of security warning dialogs, Journal of Multidisciplinary Engineering Science and Technology, 2, 6, pp. 1337-1345, (2015); Raja F., Hawkey K., Hsu S., Wang K.L.C., Beznosov K., A brick wall, a lock door and a bandit: A physical metaphor for firewall warnings, Proceedings of the Seventh Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 1-20, (2011); Brusoloni J.C., Villamarin-Salomon R., Improving security decision with polymorphic and audited dialogs,  Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 76-85, (2007); Anderson B.B., Kirwan C.B., Jenkins J.L., Eargle D., Howard S., Vance A., How polymorphic warning reduce habituation in the brain: Insights from fMRI study, Processing of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems; Krol K., Moroz M., Sasse M.A., Don't work.

It significantly improves users’ experience during sensing activities since their active involvement in the labeling process is reduced. An unsupervised learning technique such as clustering can be used to automatically annotate sensor data. However, the lingering issue with clustering is the validation of generated clusters. In this paper, we adopted the k-means clustering algorithm for annotating unlabeled sensor data for the purpose of detecting sensitive location information of mobile crowd sensing users. Furthermore, we proposed a cluster validation index for the k-means algorithm, which is based on Multiple Pair-Frequency. Thereafter, we trained three classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Naïve Bayes) using cluster labels generated from the k-means clustering algorithm. The accuracy, precision, and recall of these classifiers were evaluated during the classification of “non-sensitive” and “sensitive” data from motion and location sensors. Very high accuracy scores were recorded from Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers while a fairly high accuracy score was recorded from the Naïve Bayes classifier. With the hybridized machine learning (unsupervised and supervised) technique presented in this paper, unlabeled sensor data was automatically annotated and then classified. © 2018 by the authors.","Activity recognition; Clustering; Data security; Multivariate data; Sensitive data","Location; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Security of data; Smartphones; Support vector machines; Activity recognition; Automatic annotation; Clustering; K-Means clustering algorithm; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Location information; Multivariate data; Sensitive datas; Clustering algorithms","","","","","","","Capponi A., Fiandrino C., Kliazovich D., Bouvry P., Giordano S.A., Cost-effective distributed framework for data collection in cloud-based mobile crowd sensing architectures, IEEE Trans.

Accordingly, it is specifically designed to impersonate a legitimate security alerting function (e.g., notify, warn and advice) to a user about the consequence effect of an action. However, most of the computer users tend to ignore those security warnings conveying the same message over and over again. This eventually leads to habituation. Considering the fact that there is a significant lack of focus been paid to address this issue, the main objective of this paper is to describe and summarize the related studies on users’ habituation to the security warnings. This paper presents a systematic literature review to explore the current key issues, challenges and the possible solutions related to habituation effects in security warnings. It is expected that this paper could contribute to a more complete understanding of the habituation effects in security warnings and eventually bring benefits to the research communities or general publics. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Habituation; security; usability; usable security; warning","Computer science; Information science; Habituation; security; usability; Usable security; warning; Security of data","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6313287)","This work was supported by the short-term grant from the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [304/PKOMP/6313287].","Ahmad R., Improving computer security warnings, a mental model approach in higher educations, (2015); Akhawe D., Felt A.P., Alice in Warningland: A large-scale field study of browser security warning effectiveness, Proceeding of the 22nd UNISEX Security Symposium, pp. 257-272, (2013); Anderson B.B., Kirwan C.B., Jenkins J.L., Eargle D., Howard S., Vance A., How polymorphic warning reduce habituation in the brain: Insights from fMRI study, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 2883-2892, (2015); Anderson B.B., Vance A., Kirwan B., Eargle D., Users aren’t (necessarily) Lazy: Using NeuroIS to explain habituation to security warnings, (2014); Bravo-Lillo C., Cranor L.F., Downs J., Komanduri S., Reeder R.W., Schechter S., Sleeper W., Your attention please: Designing security-decision UIs to make genuine risk harder to ignore, Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS), (2013); Bravo-Lillo C., Cranor L.F., Downs J.S., Komanduri S., Bridging the gap in computer security warnings: A mental model approach. security and privacy, IEEE, 9, 2, pp. 18-26, (2011); Bravo-Lillo C., Cranor L.F., Downs J.S., Komanduri S., POSTER: What is still wrong with security warnings: A mental model approach, Proceeding of the Sixth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, (2011); Bravo-Lillo C.A., Improving computer security dialogs: An exploration of attention and habituation, (2014); Brustoloni J.C., Villamarin-Salomon R., Improving security decision with polymorphic and audited dialogs, Proceeding of the 3rd Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 76-85, (2007); Camp J., Asgharpour F., Liu D., Experimental evaluations of expert and non-expert computer users mental model of security risks, (2008); Craik K.J.W., The nature of explanation, Cambridge University Press, Philosophy, 19, 73, pp. 173-174, (1943); Dourish P., Anderson K., Privacy, security… and risk and danger and secrecy and trust and identity and morality and power: Understanding collective information practices, Report No. UCI-ISR-05-1, (2004); Edward W.K., Poole S.E., Stoll J., Security automation considered harmful?, Proceedings of the Workshop on New Security Paradigms, pp. 33-42, (2007); Egelmen S., Trust me: Design patterns for constructions trustworthy trust indicators, (2009); Egelmen S., Cranor L.F., Jason J., You’ve been warned: An empirical study of the effectiveness of web browser phishing warnings, The 26th Annual CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing System, (2008); Think outside the box, habituation: The “Get Used to It Concept”, (2011); Fagan M., Khan M.M.H., Why do they do what they do?

After a thorough root-cause analysis based on the Fault Tree Analysis and critical examination of the delayed functioning mechanism, the corrective actions were implemented. Further, the reliability requirements and the delay functioning requirements were met completely during developmental trials. Failures during developmental trials reveal that root cause for defects is due to human error, insufficient quality process, inadequate training and failure in addressing reliability aspects during design stage, etc. To conclude, the lesson learnt from the study was that the stringent reliability analysis of the product should be done, during initial design stage of the product, by identifying potential failure modes of the product and by addressing them prudently. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Failure; Fault tree analysis; Reliability improvement; Root-cause analysis; Single-shot device","Environmental testing; Fault tree analysis; Maintainability; Product design; Quality control; Reliability analysis; Component assembly; Design stage; Fault tree analyses (FTA); Quality process; Reliability demonstration; Reliability improvement; Root cause analysis; Single-shot; Single-shot device; Water immersion; Failure (mechanical)","","","","","","","Bain L.J., Engelhardt M., Reliability Test Plans for One-Shot Devices Based on Repeated Samples.

It is important that health care organizations are equipped with reliable software and statistical tools to analyze the vast amount of available data that can aid in the early detection of breast cancer. This paper demonstrates how the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) Methodology can be enlisted to filter such data in order to select the major attributes identified as significant factors in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Following this methodology, five classifiers will be tested out by using the WEKA software and the accuracy rate of each classifier applied to the dataset of breast cancer will be observed. These are Naive Bayes, random forest, decision tree, ZeroR and OneR. The accuracy rate of each as applied to the dataset of breast cancer markers was observed. Based on these trials, the Naive Bayes classifier has been selected as the best data mining method.","Attributes; Breast cancer; Naive Bayes classifier; WEKA","Algorithms; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Competition; Decision trees; Diseases; Filtration; Information management; Innovation; Learning systems; Regional planning; Software testing; Statistical mechanics; Attributes; Breast Cancer; Classification algorithm; Early detection of breast cancer; Healthcare organizations; Knowledge discovery in database; Naive Bayes classifiers; WEKA; Data mining","","","","","","","Abdullah N.A., Wan Mahiyuddin W., Muhammad N.A., Ali Z.M., Ibrahim L., Ibrahim Tamim N., Survival rate of breast cancer patients in Malaysia: A population-based study, Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 14, pp. 4591-4594, (2013); Americancancersociety, Cancer Facts & Figures 2015, IJIKM, (2015); Ban K.A., Godellas C.V., Epidemiology of breast cancer, Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America, 23, pp. 409-422, (2014); Bellaachia A., Guven E., Predicting breast cancer survivability using data mining techniques, Age, 58, pp. 10-110, (2006); Bin Othman M.F., Yau T.M.S., Comparison of different classification techniques using WEKA for breast cancer, 3rd Kuala Lumpur International Conference on Biomedical Engineering 2006, pp. 520-523, (2007); Bonney W., Applicability of business intelligence in electronic health record, Procedia-social and Behavioral Sciences, 73, pp. 257-262, (2013); Bouckaert R.R., Properties of Bayesian belief network learning algorithms, Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 102-109, (1994); Buntine W., Theory refinement on Bayesian networks, Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 52-60, (1991); Cancercouncilnsw, Understanding Breast Cancer a Guide for People with Cancer, (2014); Chaudhuri S., Dayal U., Narasayya V., An overview of business intelligence technology, Communications of the ACM, 54, pp. 88-98, (2011); Cios K.J., Moore G.W., Uniqueness of medical data mining, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 26, pp. 1-24, (2002); Demsar J., Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple data sets, The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 7, pp. 1-30, (2006); Fayyad U., Piatetsky-Shapiro G., Smyth P., From data mining to knowledge discovery in databases, AI Magazine, 17, (1996); Fernandes A.S., Alves P., Jarman I.H., Etchells T.A., Fonseca J.M., Lisboa P.J., A clinical decision support system for breast cancer patients, Emerging Trends in Technological Innovation, (2010); Grossman D., Domingos P., Learning Bayesian network classifiers by maximizing conditional likelihood, Proceedings of the Twenty-first International Conference on Machine Learning, (2004); Han J., Kamber M., Pei J., Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques: Concepts and Techniques, (2011); Hu R., Medical data mining based on association rules, Computer and Information Science, 3, (2010); Jakkampudi C., Robust Bayesian Classifier, (1999); Kohavi R., Provost F., Glossary of terms, Machine Learning, 30, pp. 271-274, (1998); Kunkle D., Zhang D., Cooperman G., Mining frequent generalized itemsets and generalized association rules without redundancy, Journal of Computer Science and Technology, 23, pp. 77-102, (2008); Mikut R., Reischl M., Data mining tools, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 1, pp. 431-443, (2011); Norris A., Current trends and challenges in health informatics, Health Informatics Journal, 8, pp. 205-213, (2002); Powers D.M., Evaluation: From Precision, Recall and F-measure to ROC, (2011); Salama G.I., Abdelhalim M., Zeid M.A.-E., Breast cancer diagnosis on three different datasets using multi-classifiers, Breast Cancer (WDBC), 32, (2012); Scuse D., Reutemann P., Weka experimenter tutorial for version 3-5-5, University of Waikato, (2007); Stattrek, Chi-square Test for Independence, (2015); Wahid M., Breast Cancer, (2007); Yip C., Bhoo P.N., Teo S., A review of breast cancer research in Malaysia, The Medical Journal of Malaysia, 69, pp. 8-22, (2014)","","Soliman K.S.","International Business Information Management Association, IBIMA","","26th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Innovation Management and Sustainable Economic Competitive Advantage: From Regional Development to Global Growth, IBIMA 2015","11 November 2015 through 12 November 2015","Madrid","121845","","978-098604195-2","","","English","Proc.

Tor protect its user privacy against surveillance and censorship using strong encryption and obfuscation techniques which makes it extremely difficult to monitor and identify users' activity on the Tor network. It also implements strong defense to protect the users against traffic features extraction and website fingerprinting. However, the strong anonymity also became the heaven for criminal to avoid network tracing. Therefore, numerous of research has been performed on encrypted traffic analyzing and classification using machine learning techniques. This paper presents survey on existing approaches for classification of Tor and other encrypted traffic. There is preliminary discussion on machine learning approaches and Tor network. Next, there are comparison of the surveyed traffic classification and discussion on their classification properties. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.","Encrypted traffic monitoring; Machine learning; Security; Survey; Tor","","","","","","","","Dingledine R., Mathewson N., Syverson P., Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router,, SSYM'04 Proc. 13th Conf.

Most of the current research on mobile organizers highlights that most users rely on the application as an effective tool to manage their daily activities especially among university students. A mobile organizer application is software that acts as a personal assistant for users to help them manage their time and activities. From a Malaysian context, the usage of these applications among university students has not been explored in-depth. The aim of this paper is to initially explore the current usage of mobile organizers within a Malaysian university specifically Universiti Sains Malaysia. There are a number of requirements that a mobile organizer application should fulfil, in order to be effective for users. In order to identify these requirements, an initial survey was conducted in order to identify these requirements, which, would then be incorporated into the development of a mobile organizer suitable for Malaysian university students. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Applications; Mobile organizers; Software","","","","","","","","Cisco Visual Networking Index: Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2013-2018, (2014); Zulkefly S.N., Baharudin R., Mobile phone use amongst students in a university in Malaysia: its correlates and relationship to psychological health, European Journal of Scientific Research, 37, 2, pp. 206-218, (2009); Vavoula G.N., Sharples M., KLeOS: a personal, mobile, knowledge and learning organisation system, Paper presented at the IEEE International Workshop on Wireless and Mobile Technologies in Education, (2002); Balakrishnan V., Raj R.G., Exploring the relationship between urbanized Malaysian youth and their mobile phones: A quantitative approach, Telematics and Informatics, 29, 3, pp. 263-272, (2012); Mirisaee S.H., Zin A.M., A Framework for Context-Aware University Mobile Organizer, (2009); Bolton R.N., Parasuraman A., Hoefnagels A., Migchels N., Kabadayi S., Gruber T., Loureiro Y.K., Solnet D., Understanding Generation Y and their use of social media: a review and research agenda, Journal of Service Management, 24, 3, pp. 245-267, (2013); Al Tunaiji A., Zemerly M.J., MUSO: An Mlearning & University Student Organizer platform, (2010); Population Distribution and Basic Demographic Characteristics, Department of Statistics Malaysia, (2010); Badroddin S., Pakih S., Indikator Pengajian Tinggi Malaysia 2011-2012, (2012); Jumlah Enrolmen Pelajar Antarabangsa Di Institusi Pengajian Tinggi (IPT) Mengikut Negara Asal, Tahun 2003-2009, (2009); Vavoula G.N., Sharples M., Requirements for the design of lifelong learning organisers, pp. 23-26, (2002); Mirisaee S.H., Zin A.M., Determining IT students problems in an university environment and proposing a solution by a wireless organizer, Paper presented at the International Symposium on Information Technology, pp. 26-28, (2008); Mirisaee S.H., Zin A.M., A Context-Aware Mobile Organizer for University Students, Journal of Computer Science, 5, 12, pp. 898-904, (2010); Hanson V.L., Age and web access: the next generation.

The utilization of NFC technology in U-Learning concept will help to improve accessibility and encourage collaborative learning methods in the education sector. In this paper, we conduct a study to investigate eleven (11) adoptions factors of U-Learning with NFC and ranking them using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. We also utilized Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Technology Readiness (TR), and combination of TAM and TR (TRAM) as theoretical framework. We have identified TRAM as the best tool based on literature review and utilized the theory to propose an NFC-Enabled Ubiquitous Technology model. The model was utilized to design a questionnaire for survey about user acceptance. Results from the online survey were analyzed using AHP in an absolute measurement approach method. Results from AHP show that optimism is the most influencing factor in adoption of U-Learning using NFC technology followed by innovativeness and accessibility. Finally, this paper contributes in designing an NFC research model. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.","Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP); Multi criteria decision making (MCDM); Ubiquitous learning (U-Learning); Virtual learning","","","","","","","","Ebner M., Maierhuber M., Near Field Communication-Which Potentials Does NFC Bring for Teaching and Learning Materials?, International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM), 7, 4, pp. 9-14, (2013); Zahrani M.S., The benefits and potential of innovative ubiquitous learning environments to enhance higher education infrastructure and student experiences in Saudi Arabia, Journal of Applied Sciences(Faisalabad), 10, 20, pp. 2358-2368, (2010); Hoic-Bozic N., Mornar V., Boticki I., A blended learning approach to course design and implementation, IEEE transactions on education, 52, 1, pp. 19-30, (2009); Chen Y.S., Kao T.C., Sheu J.P., Chiang C.Y., A mobile scaffolding-aid-based bird-watching learning system, In Wireless and Mobile Technologies in Education, 2002.

To reflect a website's, service's, or app's privacy policies, they're frequently used as a beginning step for researchers investigating the reliability of stated data regulations, user comprehension of policy, or user control methods. It's challenging to collect information about privacy practices from Internet resources like websites and mobile applications for analysis because of the wide variations in the structure, presentation, and content. Most computer privacy studies attempt to test new methods for detecting, classifying, and analyzing computer privacy content. However, numerous papers have been published to promote research activities, and no trace of any bibliometric analysis work on computer privacy demonstrates research trends. By conducting a thorough analysis of computer privacy studies, it searches the Scopus database, which contains over 2000 papers published between 1976 and 2020. Using the bibliometric analysis technique, this study examines research activity in Europe, South America, and other continents. This work investigated the number of papers published, citations, research area, keywords, institutions, topics, and researchers in detail. An overview of the research efforts is followed by listing the words into a classification of computer privacy analysis tools, emphasizing the significance of a computer privacy research study. According to the investigation findings, there are numerous significant implications of research efforts in Europe compared to other continents. Finally, we summarize the review findings for each part by highlighting potential future research directions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE.","Bibliometric analysis; Computer privacy; IoT computer privacy; Privacy; Security","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2023/ICT07/USM/02/1)","The Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia supported this research for the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with Project Code: FRGS/1/2023/ICT07/USM/02/1.

Existing researches have shown that new systems require novice users to spend an amount of time to get to know the technology. Near Field Communication (NFC) is an emerging technology, which offers an enhanced interaction for users by simplifying data transfers, secured payment transaction access and many more. In this paper, we looked into a number of widely used acceptance models such as the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theory Planned Behavior (TPB) and, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to identify the theory that is best suited as an assessment tool of the user acceptance to the NFC technology. We have identified UTAUT as the best tool based on literature and utilized the theory to develop a questionnaire for the user acceptance survey. Our results indicates, factors such as social influence and facilitating condition affected the users' technology acceptance for NFC where most respondents are willing to use the technology if they had the chance to do so. © 2015 IEEE.","Near Field Communication; Technology Acceptance Model; Unified Theory of Acceptance and Usage of Technology","Data transfer; Economic and social effects; Electronic money; Industrial management; Mobile telecommunication systems; Surveys; Emerging technologies; Facilitating conditions; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; The near field communication (NFC); The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Theory of reasoned action; Unified theory; Near field communication","","","","","","","Steffen R., Preiinger J., Schollermann T., Muller A., Near Field Communication (NFC) in an automative environent, Second International Workshop on Near Field Communication, pp. 15-20, (2010); Dillon A., Morris M., User acceptance of information and technology: Theories and models, Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 31, pp. 3-32, (1996); Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly, 13, pp. 319-340, (1989); Venkatesh V., Davis F.D., A theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model: Four longitudinal field studies, Management Science, 2, pp. 186-204, (2000); Venkatesh V., Creation of favorable user perceptions: Exploring the role of intrinsic motivation, MIS Quarterly, 2, pp. 239-260, (1999); Venkatesh V., User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view, MIS Quarterly, 27, 3, pp. 425-478, (2003); Fishbein M., Ajzen I., Believe, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior:An Introduction to Theory and Research, (1975); Au S., Parameswaran N., Problem solving with attitude and the theory of reasoned action, IEEE/WIC International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology IEEE, pp. 1-4, (2003); Teh P., Ahmed P.K., MOA and TRA in social Commerce: An intergrated model, Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management Singapore IEEE, pp. 1375-1378, (2011); Sogani S., Muduganti R., Hexmoor H., Davis F., Introducing agent based implementation of the theory of reasoned action: A case study in user acceptance of computer technology, KIMAS International Conference IEEE, pp. 507-510, (2005); Ajzen I., Constructing A Theory of Planned Behavior Questionnaire, pp. 1-12, (2006); Lin T.C., Hsu M.H., Kuo F.Y., Sun P.C., An intention Model-based study of software piracy, 32nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences IEEE, (1999); Lu Y., Zhou T., Wang B., Exploring Chinese user' acceptance of instant messaging using the theory of planned behavior, the technology acceptance model, and the flow theory, Computer in Human Behavior, 25, pp. 29-39, (2009); Lin J., Chan H.C., Wei K.K., Understanding competing web application platforms : An extended theory of planned behavior and its relative model, Engineering Management, 58, (2011); Wu Y., Tao Y., Yang P., Using UTAUT to explore the behavior of3G mobile communication users, Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM) Singapore IEEE, pp. 209-212, (2007); Gao T., Deng Y., A study on users' acceptance behavior to mobile E-books application based on UTAUT model, ICSESS3rd International Conference Beijing IEEE, (2012)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2nd International Symposium on Technology Management and Emerging Technologies, ISTMET 2015","25 August 2015 through 27 August 2015","Langkawi","118506","","978-147991723-5","","","English","Int.

Employees, however, have been exposed to different security risks because of working from home. Moreover, the rapid global spread of COVID-19 has increased the volume of data generated from various sources. Working from home depends mainly on cloud computing (CC) applications that help employees to efficiently accomplish their tasks. The cloud computing environment (CCE) is an unsung hero in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. It consists of the fast-paced practices for services that reflect the trend of rapidly deployable applications for maintaining data. Despite the increase in the use of CC applications, there is an ongoing research challenge in the domains of CCE concerning data, guaranteeing security, and the availability of CC applications. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first paper that thoroughly explains the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CCE. Additionally, this paper also highlights the security risks of working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021.

These technologies are a portion of wireless communication technology. Even though NFC technologies benefit in various field, but it’s still exposed to multiple type of privacy attacks and threat as well since the communication occur in an open environment. The filtering technique been perform on the tag in order to get access to the embedded information. As solution based on tag filtering techniques, existing NFC filtering, Intent filtering has merged together with Bloom filtering from RFID technology. This help in term of elimination the duplicate tag and verify the receiving tag. Meanwhile, as a content protection to NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) message been transmitted through the communication channel, Advance Encryption Standard (AES) 128bit has been implemented on the NDEF message. AES provide solution to encrypt the NDEF message which has been communicated. Bloom filtering performed the hashing operation using MD5 technique as a verification of registered user to the NFC system. While the default Intent filtering direct the user to the selected invocation as registered on the tag after the Bloom filtering verification. Besides that, implementation of AES cryptographic in NDEF message, took approximately about 80 trillion years++ to crack the key using brute force attack. Communication of two legitimate entities is secured with AES encryption. Hence, secured user validation or filtering with encrypted message, prevent the possibility for MITM attacker to retrieve sensitive or personal information. The overall framework provide a better security solution compare to the existing framework. © 2017 ASTES Publishers.

Decrement in security within clouds contributes to a loss of clients-confidence, lack of control and loss of trustworthiness in cloud service providers. Loss of control occurs when clients lose their control over their own resources in the hand of service provider. As lack of authentication and access control placed by providers, loss of control contributes to greater security concern. In this research, a novel trust framework is proposed which focus on tackling the loss of central concern by granting back control to the cloud clients in ensuring their service provider environments fully secure and trustworthy. Secondly, the trust model also functions in ensuring that both client and service providers transaction follows set of security mechanism in place. The results proved that both trust need to be enforced is any cloud. Thus the proposed trust model contributes as a mean to solve the security challenges known as loss of control. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Access control; Authentication; Cloud computing; Loss of Control; Trust","Access control; Authentication; Computer science; Network security; Cloud service providers; Loss of control; Security and privacy; Security challenges; Security mechanism; Service provider; Trust; Trust frameworks; Cloud computing","","","","","","","Dillon T., Et al., Cloud computing issues and challenges, 24th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications, Perth, WA, (2010); Wang Z., Security and privacy issues within the cloud computing, International Conference on Computational and Information Sciences, Chengdu, China, (2011); Lar S.-U., Et al., Cloud computing privacy &Security global issues, challenges, &Mechanisms, 6th International ICST Conference on Communications and Networking in China (CHINACOM 2011), Harbin, (2011); Ko R.K.L., Et al., TrustCloud a framework for accountability and trust in cloud computing, World Congress on Services 2011, pp. 584-588, (2011); Winkler V., Data Security in Cloud Computing-Part 3: Cloud Data Protection Methods; Jensen J., Federated identity management challenges, Seventh International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, (2012); Lum J.J., Implemanting Zero-Knowledge Authentication with Zero Knowledge (ZKA-wzk), (2010); Lin C., Varadharajan V., A hybrid trust model for enhancing security in distributed systems, The Second International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, ARES 2007, pp. 35-42, (2007); Firdhous M., Et al., Trust management in cloud computing a critical review, International Journal on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions, 4, 2, pp. 24-36, (2011); Mahinderjit-Singh M., Li X., Computational model for trust management in rFID supply chains, IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems, MASS 2009, Macau, pp. 734-740, (2009); Zhang P., Et al., Survey of trust management on various networks, 2011International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems, Seoul, pp. 219-226, (2011)","","","Springer Verlag","","5th FTRA International Conference on Computer Science and its Applications, CSA 2013","18 December 2013 through 21 December 2013","Danang","104420","18761100","978-364241673-6","","","English","Lect.

The behaviour of granting permissions requested by apps might expose the Android smartphone user to privacy risks. The existing works lack a formalized mathematical model that can quantify user and system applications risks. No multifaceted data collector tool can also be used to monitor the collection of user data and the risk posed by each application. A benchmark of the risk level that alerts the user and distinguishes between acceptable and unacceptable risk levels in Android smartphone user does not exist. Hence, to address privacy risk, a formalized privacy model called PRiMo that uses a tree structure and calculus knowledge is proposed. An App-sensor Mobile Data Collector (AMoDaC) is developed and implemented in real life to analyse user data accessed by mobile applications through the permissions granted and the risks involved. A benchmark is proposed by comparing the proposed PRiMo outcome with the existing available testing metrics. The results show that Tools & Utility/Productivity applications posed the highest risk as compared to other categories of applications. Furthermore, 29 users faced low and acceptable risk, while two users faced medium risk. According to the benchmark proposed, users who faced risks below 25% are considered as safe. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed work is 96.8%. © 2021 by the authors.

The current literature lacks effective solutions for this issue. In this study, the negative impacts of SMS spam were thoroughly analysed, and the existing techniques for SMS spam detection were investigated through two experiments. The first experiment was performed to test and compare the current data mining and cost-sensitive techniques, whereas the second experiment was conducted to test the performance of the proposed technique. Based on the experimental results of the first phase, the most optimal non-cost classifier is a Bayesian network classifier, which is well behaved under the cost-sensitive classifier and obtained the lowest rate of false negative and an acceptable false positive rate. The proposed strategy achieves the best performance in terms of false negative SMS spam classification, obtaining the smallest total expenses and highest precision amongst the compared strategies. © 2020","Cost-sensitive modelling; Data mining technique; Mobile device; Spam text","Bayesian networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Bayesian network classifiers; Cost-sensitive; Effective solution; False negatives; False positive rates; Short messaging service; Spam classification; Spam detection; Data mining","","","","","","","Ahmed I., Guan D., Chung T.C., Sms classification based on naive Bayes classifier and apriori algorithm frequent itemset, Int J Mach Learn Comput, 4, 2, (2014); Almeida T., Hidalgo J.M.G., Silva T.P., Towards SMS spam filtering: results under a new dataset, Int J Infor Sec.

However, the reputations of LBS application have raised some privacy and security issues such as location tracked by third parties and creation of fake reviews and events through Sybil attack. Fake events on LBS such as congestion, accidents or police activity affect routes users and fake reviews caused nuisances and decreases trust towards this technology. The current trust model in LBS is single faceted and not personalized. The concept of both trust and distrust are essential criteria of any trust management model to measure the reliability of LBS applications. This paper explores the relationship between trust models and the distrust concept in LBS. By deriving a representation of the multi-faceted model and balance theory conceptualized in a MiniLBS prototype, trust in this technology is quantified. By adopting matrix factorization and probability algorithms on the survey results, the relationship between distrust and trust is further examined and tested. The result obtained from the experiment was nearly zero, the smallest one was 3.0253 × 10-95, and the largest value was only 4.967 × 10-43. The results show that distrust is not a negation of trust. Another crucial finding suggests that balance theory within distrust in the LBS trust model can enhance the trust management model in LBS and indirectly cater issues rise from fake event problem. © 2019 by the authors.","Internet of Things (IoT); Multi-faceted model; Security; Social network service (SNS); Trust","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PNAV/631627)","This research was supported by the Bridging Research Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) No: 304/PNAV/631627.This research received no external funding.","Yun H., Dongho H., Choong C.L., Understanding the use of location-based service applications: Do privacy concerns matter?, J.

Age society often suffers from common problems such as Alzheimer's disease that disrupts their daily life. Moreover, it restricted their activity area, safety and freedom in their daily life. Hence, a tracking system is good for their relatives or guardian to track their location and path. When the population of aged society increases and the number of elders being lost increases, current tracking and monitoring systems are unable to satisfy the needs of the community. Hence, a smart tracking and monitoring system that automatically tracks and monitor these elderly person is required. INdoor-OuTdoor Elderly CAring SystEm (NOTECASE) is a real-time tracking and monitoring system that utilizes the RFID, Wi-Fi, and Global Location Positioning System (GPS) aim to track and monitor the aged society, both within indoors and outdoors environment.

However, Salsa20/7 is broken and Salsa20/12 is not as safe as before. Therefore, Salsa20 must completely perform all of the four rounds of encryption to achieve a good diffusion in order to resist the known attacks. In this paper, a new variant of Salsa20 that uses the chaos theory and that can achieve diffusion faster than the original Salsa20 is presented. The method has been tested and benchmarked with the original Salsa20 with a series of tests. Most of the tests show that the proposed chaotic Salsa of two rounds is faster than the original four rounds of Salsa20/4, but it offers the same diffusion level. © 2015 KIPS.","Chaos theory; Cryptography; Differential attacks; Hash function; Logistic map; Salsa20; Stream cipher","Chaos theory; Diffusion; Hash functions; Chaotic logistic maps; Differential attacks; Logistic maps; Salsa20; Stream Ciphers; Cryptography","","","","","","","De Canniere C., Preneel B., Trivium,"" in New Stream Cipher Designs, pp. 244-266, (2008); Bernstein D.J., The Salsa20 family of stream ciphers, New Stream Cipher Designs, pp. 84-97, (2008); Mukherjee P., An overview of eSTREAM ciphers, Centre of Excellence in Cryptology, (2013); Crowley P., Truncated differential cryptanalysis of five rounds of Salsa20, The eSTREAM Project, (2005); Aumasson J.P., Fischer S., Khazaei S., Meier W., Rechberger C., New features of Latin dances: analysis of Salsa, ChaCha, and Rumba, Fast Software Encryption, pp. 470-488, (2008); Fischer S., Meier W., Berbain C., Biasse J.F., Robshaw M.J., Non-randomness in eSTREAM candidates Salsa20 and TSC-4, Progress in Cryptology-INDOCRYPT 2006, pp. 2-16, (2006); Stewart I., Does God Play Dice?, The Mathematics of Chaos, (2002); Devaney R.L., An Introduction to Chaotic Dynamical Systems, (2003); Bernstein D.J., Salsa20 design, (2005); Forre R., The Hénon attractor as a keystream generator, Abstracts of EuroCrypt'91, pp. 76-81, (1991); Verma O.P., Nizam M., Ahmad M., Modified multi-chaotic systems that are based on pixel shuffle for image encryption, Journal of Information Processing Systems, 9, 2, pp. 271-286, (2013); Frey D.R., Chaotic digital encoding: an approach to secure communication, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II, 40, pp. 660-666, (1993); Hasan A.M.N., Design and simulation of a modified perturbed digital chaotic signal generator for secure data communication, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Interaction Sciences: Information Technology, Culture and Human (ICIS'09), pp. 918-922, (2009); Wang X., Zhang J., Zhang W., Chaotic keystream generator using coupled NDFs with parameter perturbing, Cryptology and Network Security, pp. 270-285, (2006); Li S., Mou X., Cai Y., Pseudo-random bit generator based on couple chaotic systems and its applications in stream-cipher cryptography, Progress in Cryptology, pp. 316-329, (2001); Matthews R., On the derivation of a ""chaotic"" encryption algorithm, Cryptologia, 13, 1, pp. 29-42, (1989); Kanso A., Smaoui N., Logistic chaotic maps for binary numbers generations, 40, pp. 2557-2568, (2009); Pareek N.K., Patidar V., Sud K.K., Discrete chaotic cryptography using external key, Physics Letters A, 309, 1, pp. 75-82, (2003); Goldreich O., Levin L.A., A hard-core predicate for all one-way functions, Proceedings of the 21st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC'89), pp. 25-32, (1989)","A.

The drawback of this conventional method is the loss of time in jotting down the attendance, leading to human error and cheating issues and the inability of capturing and storing the attendance record for other essential university activities. In this project, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-enabled Smart Attendance Management System (RFID-SAMS) will be designed to cater to the limitation of the conventional attendance system. The RFIDSAMS system function to enrolled students and staff data and course related information, record and monitor students’ attendance and their movement during any courses attended. Its ability to uniquely identify each person based on their RFID tag type of ID card make the process of taking the attendance easier, faster and secure as compared to conventional method. The uniqueness of RFID-SAMS is the capability to detect any duplication RFID event readings and miss readings. In addition, this system has been enhanced to cater the latest ubiquitous technology such as the mobile devices, which are Window Phone and Windows Surface RT. The overall system provides an efficient, accurate and portability solution and work well for the real-life attendance environment within the university. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Attendance system; RFID; Smartphone; Tablet; Web page; Windows phone; Windows surface","Students; Telephone sets; Websites; Attendance management systems; Attendance records; Attendance systems; Conventional methods; System functions; Tablet; Ubiquitous technology; Windows phones; Radio frequency identification (RFID)","","","","","","","Abd Wahab M.H., Abdul Kadir H., Mohd Yusof M.N., Sanudin R., Tomari M.R., Class attendance system using active RFID: A review, Compilation of Papers, 2, pp. 9-21, (2009); Arulogun O.T., Olatunbosun A., Fakolujo O.A., Olaniyi O.M., RFID-based students attendance management system, Int J Sci Eng Res 4(2):1-9.

During mobile sensing, data mostly contain sensitive information of users such as their real-time location. When such information are not effectively secured, users’ privacy can be violated due to eavesdropping and information disclosure. In this paper, we demonstrated the possibility of unauthorized access to location information of a user during sensing due to the ineffective security mechanisms in most sensing applications. We analyzed 40 apps downloaded from Google Play Store and results showed a 100% success rate in traffic interception and disclosure of sensitive information of users. As a countermeasure, a security scheme which ensures encryption and authentication of sensed data using Advanced Encryption Standard 256-Galois Counter Mode was proposed. End-to-end security of location and motion data from smartphone sensors are ensured using the proposed security scheme. Security analysis of the proposed scheme showed it to be effective in protecting Android based sensor data against eavesdropping, information disclosure and data modification. © 2018, Nsikak P.

Accordingly, it is specifically designed to impersonate a legitimate security alerting function (e.g., notify, warn, and advice) to a user about the consequence effect of an action. However, most of the computer users tend to ignore those security warnings conveying the same message over and over again. This eventually leads to habituation. Considering the fact that there is a significant lack of focus paid to address this issue, the main objective of this article is to describe and summarize the related studies on users’ habituation to the security warnings. This article presents a systematic literature review to explore the current key issues, challenges, and the possible solutions related to habituation effects in security warnings. It is expected that this article could contribute to a more complete understanding of the habituation effects in security warnings and eventually bring benefits to the research communities or general publics. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Habituation; security; usability; usable security; warning","Security of data; 'current; Computer users; Habituation; Key Issues; Security; Security warning; Systematic literature review; Usability; Usable security; Warning; Conveying","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6313287)","This work was supported by a short-term grant from the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [304/PKOMP/6313287].","Ahmad R., Improving computer security warnings, a mental model approach in higher educations, MSc Thesis, (2015); Akhawe D., Felt A.P., Alice in warningland: A large-scale field study of browser security warning effectiveness, Proceeding of the 22nd UNISEX Security Symposium, pp. 257-272, (2013); Amran A., Zaaba Z.F., Singh M.M., Marashdih A.W., Usable security: Revealing end-users comprehensions on security warnings, Procedia Computer Science, 124, pp. 624-631, (2017); Anderson B.B., Kirwan C.B., Jenkins J.L., Eargle D., Howard S., Vance A., How polymorphic warning reduce habituation in the brain: Insights from fMRI study, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 2883-2892, (2015); Anderson B.B., Vance A., Kirwan B., Eargle D., Users aren’t (necessarily) lazy: Using neurois to explain habituation to security warnings, IS Security and Privacy, (2014); Bravo-Lillo C., Cranor L.F., Downs J., Komanduri S., Reeder R.W., Schechter S., Sleeper W., Your attention please: Designing security-decision UIs to make genuine risk harder to ignore, In Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS), (2013); Bravo-Lillo C., Cranor L.F., Downs J.S., Komanduri S., Bridging the gap in computer security warnings: A mental model approach. security and privacy, Ieee, 9, 2, pp. 18-26, (2011); Bravo-Lillo C., Cranor L.F., Downs J.S., Komanduri S., POSTER: What is still wrong with security warnings: A mental model approach, In Proceeding of the Sixth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, (2011); Bravo-Lillo C.A., Improving computer security dialogs: An exploration of attention and habituation, PhD Thesis)., (2014); Brustoloni J.C., Villamarin-Salomon R., Improving security decision with polymorphic and audited dialogs, Proceeding of the 3rd Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 76-85, (2007); Camp J., Asgharpour F., Liu D., Experimental evaluations of expert and non-expert computer users mental model of security risks, (2008); Craik K.J.W., The nature of explanation Philosophy, 19, 73, pp. 173-174, (1943); Privacy, Security … and Risk and Danger and Secrecy and Trust and Identity and Morality and Power: Understanding Collective Information Practices.

For digitalisation enhancing innovations in developing countries and poverty presents unique challenges. E-commerce in layman's term refers to the activity of buying and selling over the Internet. Many young entrepreneurs and individual Islamic businesses have a website set up to catch up to technology and to advertise or promote their products. However, young entrepreneurs do not employ an e-commerce solution. This paper aims to develop simplicity to create an e-commerce store to allow and to sell products over the Internet. In addition, young entrepreneurship development from an Islamic perspective. The proposed solution includes extracting the product information available to the user and then set up a generic secure e-commerce prototype aim to store information from existing non-e-commerce website selling products. The prototype designed in this provides standard features of a common online store, shopping cart and payment solutions. A mobile version of the online store is also designed for further easing the process of purchasing products for the customer as mobile computing is on the rise and people are getting more and more reliable on their smartphone to perform various tasks. This paper emphasises the need for young entrepreneurs to understand digitalisation as an integral part of the dynamic business sustainability nexus and the new global business equation.

Based on the research, there is a lack of understanding for APT derived from user behavior. User behavior can be defined as a user action performed on digital systems with or without malicious intent that leads to APT attacks. As a result, most Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) detection solutions failed to provide completeness and mitigate APT attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes a Mobile Advanced Persistent Threat detection based on a Device Behavior (SHOVEL) framework. This paper demonstrates how user behavior impacts Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) via social engineering attacks such as Spear phishing, watering hole, Repackaging the application, SQL injection, and Malware attacks. The proposed APT detection framework is a novel technique in the fight against APT that presents decision-making as self-adaptive, auto-predictive, and auto-reflective. Furthermore, it complies with Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) to protect sensitive information. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Attack tree; MITRE ATT&CK; Risk management (RM); Situational awareness (SA); Tactic technique and procedure (TTP); Threat modeling; Zero-trust model","Behavioral research; Decision making; Malware; Attack tree; MITRE ATT&CK; Risk management; Risks management; Situational awareness; Tactic technique and procedure; Threat modeling; Trust models; Zero-trust model; Risk management","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, under Grant FRGS 203.PKOMP.6711931.","Zulkefli Z., Mahinderjit Singh M., Sentient-based access control model: A mitigation technique for advanced persistent threats in smartphones, J Inf Sec Appl, 51, (2020); Tatam M., Shanmugam B., Azam S., Kannoorpatti K., A Review of Threat Modelling Approaches for Apt-Style Attacks, (2021); Alfred R., Lim Y., Asri A., Ibrahim A., Anthony P., Lect Notes Electric Eng, (2018); Al-Shaer R., Spring J.M., Christou E., Learning the Associations of MITRE ATT&CK Adversarial Techniques, (2020); Nguyen P.H., Turkay C., Andrienko G., Andrienko N., Thonnard O., Zouaoui J., Understanding user behaviour through action sequences: From the usual to the unusual, IEEE Trans Visual Comput Graph, 25, pp. 2838-2852, (2019); McGough A.S., Wall D., Brennan J., Theodoropoulos G., Ruck-Keene E., Arief B., Gamble C., Fitzgerald J., van Moorsel A., Alwis S., Insider threats: Identifying anomalous human behaviour in heterogeneous systems using beneficial intelligent software (Ben-ware), MIST 2015—proceedings of the 7Th ACM CCS International Workshop on Managing Insider Security Threats, Co-Located with CCS, 2015, pp. 1-12, (2015); Zulkefli Z., Singh M.M., Malim N.H.A.H., Advanced persistent threat mitigation using multilevel security—access control framework, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics, pp. 90-105, (2015); Of Breaches are Caused by Human Error, (2021); The Role of Human Error in Successful Cyber Security Breaches, (2021); Sonderen T (2019) a Manual for Attack Trees; Sanchez P.M.S., Valero J.M.J., Celdran A.H., Bovet G., Perez M.G., Perez G.M., A survey on device behavior fingerprinting: Data sources, techniques, application scenarios, And Datasets, (2020); Sharmeen S., Huda S., Abawajy J.H., Ismail W.N., Hassan M.M., Malware threats and detection for industrial mobile-IoT networks, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 15941-15957, (2018); Grobler M., Gaire R., Nepal S., User, usage and usability: Redefining human centric cyber security, Front Big Data, 4, (2021); Hadlington L., Human factors in cybersecurity; examining the link between [3_T D $ D I F F] internet addiction, impulsivity, attitudes towards cybersecurity, and risky cybersecurity behaviours, Heliyon, 3, (2017); Stealth Mango & Tangelo Selling Your Fruits to Nation State Actors, (2018); Vo N.N.Y., Liu S., He X., Xu G., Multimodal mixture density boosting network for personality mining, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics, pp. 644-655, (2018); McBride M., Carter L., Warkentin M., Exploring the Role of Individual Employee Characteristics and Personality on Employee Compliance with Cybersecurity Policies, (2012); Cycraft Classroom MITRE ATT&CK versus Cyber Kill Chain versus Diamond Model by Cycraft Technology Corp Cycraft Medium, (2021); Webb J., Ahmad A., Maynard SB, (2016); Yan X., Wang H., Survey on zero-trust network security, Artificial Intelligence and Security (6Th International Conference, ICAIS 2020 Hohhot, China, July 17–20, 2020, pp. 50-60, (2020); Ahmad A., Maynard S.B., Desouza K.C., Kotsias J., Whitty M.T., Baskerville R.L., Cybersecurity incident response in organizations: An exploratory case study and process model of situation awareness, Comput Secur, 101, (2021); Wang W., Zhao M., Gao Z., Xu G., Xian H., Li Y., Zhang X., Constructing features for detecting android malicious applications: Issues taxonomy and directions, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 67602-67631, (2019); Pragmatic Thinking Novice Vs Expert-Dzone Agile, (2021); Albladi S., Weir G., Personality Traits and Cyber-Attack Victimisation: Multiple Mediation Analysis, (2017)","T.

This study provides an empirical model to detect individual terrorist using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profiling. In the research design and analysis approach, four metric values of DNA materials guanine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine form a dataset were assigned to a sample of a hundred people and tested using regression analysis. The tests were conducted to generate a mathematical model that minimizes errors in the experiment. After model evaluations and validations, the result shows 99.43% detection rate accuracy. The model was used to measure the weight of individual involvement in crime such as cybercrime, and terrorism as presented by the people’s DNA test. The result from this study performs better when compared with the recent studies of other state-of-the-art techniques such as text analysis, machine learning algorithms, data mining, high efficiency video coding detection and statistical mixture models identification. Therefore, we proposed an empirical model using DNA profiling for identifying individuals involved in terrorism to enable empirical evidence in a forensic investigation. © IAEME Publication.","Crime detection; Empirical model; Individual DNA profiling; Terrorism","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","We thank the School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Penang, Malaysia.

The challenge of the growing ageing population is health and social care services. As the population lives longer, the costs of institutional care rises and elderly who not able live independently in their own homes without caregivers. Moreover, it restricted their activity area, safety and freedom in their daily life. Hence, a tracking system is worthy for their caregivers to track their real-time location with efficient. Currently tracking and monitoring systems are unable to satisfy the needs of the community. Hence, Indoor-Outdoor Elderly Secure and Tracking care system (IOET) proposed to track and monitor elderly. This Mobile Crowdsensing type of system is using indoor and outdoor positioning system to locate elder which utilizes the RFID, NFC, biometric system and GPS aim to secure the safety of elderly within indoors and outdoors environment. A mobile application and web-based application to be designed for this system. This system able to real-time tracking by combining GPS and NFC for outdoor coverage where ideally in smart city. In indoor coverage, the system utilizes active RFID tracking elderly movement. The system will prompt caregiver wherever elderly movement or request by using the notification service which provided the real-time notify.

Exploration of cybercrime challenges, especially the preventions and detections of the cybercrime should be investigated by composing all the stakeholders and players of a cybercrime issue. In this paper; an exploration of several cybercrime stakeholders is done. It is argued that cybercrime is a systemic threat and cannot be tackled with cybersecurity and legal systems. The architectural model proposed is significant and should become one of the considered milestones in designing security control in tackling cybercrime globally. © 2019 The Authors.","Big data; Cyberspace; Internet of things (IoT); Routine activity theory; Systemic","Big data; Information systems; Information use; Internet of things; Architectural modeling; Cyber security; Cyberspaces; Hard problems; Internet of Things (IOT); Routine activity theories; Security controls; Systemic; Computer crime","","","","","University Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia","This research is funded by a RUI Grant no: 1001/PKOMP/8014003 which was awarded by University Sains Malaysia (USM).","Kim W., Jeong O.R., Kim C., So J., The dark side of the internet: Attacks, costs and responses, Information Systems, 36, 3, pp. 675-705, (2011); Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime, (2013); Brar H.S., Kumar G., Cybercrimes: A proposed taxonomy and challenges, Journal of Computer Networks and Communications, (2018); Morgan S., Cybercrime Damages $6 Trillion by 2021, (2017); Identity Fraud Hits All Time High with 16.7 Million U.S. Victims in 2017, According to New Javelin Strategy & Research Study; Jaishankar K., Space transition theory of cyber crimes, Crimes of the Internet, pp. 283-301, (2008); Leukfeldt E.R., Yar M., Applying routine activity theory to cybercrime: A theoretical and empirical analysis, Deviant Behavior, 37, 3, pp. 263-280, (2016); Martin N., Rice J., CyberCrime: Understanding and addressing the concerns of stakeholders, Computers & Security, 30, 8, pp. 803-814, (2011); Tee K., Current Laws Inadequate to Deal with Cross-Border Cybercrimes, (2018); Solms B.V., Information security — A multidimensional discipline, Computers & Security, 20, 6, pp. 504-508, (2001); Singh M.M., Chan C.W., Zulkefli Z., Security and privacy risks awareness for bring your own device (BYOD) paradigm, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA), 8, 2, (2017); Pius Owoh N., Mahinderjit Singh M., Zaaba Z.F., Automatic annotation of unlabeled data from smartphone-based motion and location sensors, Sensors, 18, (2018); Zulkefli Z., Mahinderjit Singh M., Malim N.H.A.H., Advanced persistent threat mitigation using multi level security - Access control framework, Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2015, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 9158, (2015); Kilpatrick H., The Threats Artificial Intelligence Poses to Cybersecurity, (2018); Scheneir B., Chapter 7: The human factor, Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in A Networked World, (2000); Bekker A., Buried under Big Data: Security Issues, Challenges, Concerns, (2018); Clarke R.V., Felson M., Routine activity and rational choice, Advances in Criminology Theory, 5, (1993); Felson M., Crime and Everyday Life: Insight and Implications for Society, (1994); Bandura A., Social Learning Theory, (1977); Volti R., Ogburn W.F., Social change with respect to culture and original nature, Technology and Culture, 45, 2, pp. 396-405, (2004); Goldsmith A., Brewer R., Digital drift and the criminal interaction order, Theoretical Criminology, 19, 1, pp. 112-130, (2015); Top 10 Technology Highlights of 2009, (2009); Richmond S., Barnett E., Warman M., Top 10 Technology Highlights of 2010, (2010); Richmond S., Warman M., Williams C., Barnett E., Technology Trends of 2011: Year in Review, (2011); Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia Indonesia, (1976); Joint Communique of the Fourth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crime (AMMTC), (2004); ASEAN ICT Masterplan 2015 Completion Report, (2015); ASEAN Telecommunications and IT Ministers Meeting (TELMIN), (2016); ASEAN Regional Forum Statement on Cooperation in Fighting Cyber Attack and Terrorist Misuse of Cyberspace, (2006); Paedophile Richard Huckle Who Abused Malaysian Children Jailed for Life, (2016); Richard Huckle: Malaysian Police 'Weren'T Given Enough Info' on British Paedophile; Gottfredson M., Hirschi T., A General Theory of Crime, (1990); Lindley J., Coulton P., Coope R., Informed by design, Living in the Internet of Things: Cybersecurity of the IoT - 2018, pp. 1-12, (2018)","M.M.

The APT attack has several attacks, such as social engineering techniques via spear phishing, SQL injection, malware, and watering hole. A smartphone contains many sensors and services, which are essential in supporting user activities that could comprise sensitive information. Therefore, a smartphone has become the primary goal of attackers to carry out Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks. Many challenges occurred due to the vulnerability of smartphone sensors and services, security framework, and ineffectiveness of methods for detecting APT. Although there are many APT solutions designed and implemented, they fail to provide a comprehensive solution. The reason is due to the lack of APT attack profiles or fingerprinting. Fingerprinting of attacks follows a step by steps of TTP. As a result, this paper proposes an FORMAP framework based on the correlation between MITRE Framework and the attack tree. This framework contributes in improving the security awareness that supports detecting an APT attack on smartphones. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Advanced persistent threat (APT); Attack tree; MITRE ATTACK; Mobile sensors; Tactics techniques and procedures (TTP); Threat modeling","Forestry; Malware; Mobile security; Advanced persistent threat; Attack tree; Detection framework; Exfiltration; MITRE ATTACK; Mobile sensors; Smart phones; Tactic technique and procedure; Threat detection; Threat modeling; Smartphones","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, under Grant FRGS 203.PKOMP.6711931.","Chuan B.L.J., Singh M.M., Shariff A.R.M., APTGuard: Advanced persistent threat (APT) detections and predictions using android smartphone, Lect Notes Electr Eng, 481, pp. 545-555, (2019); Al-Shaer R., Spring J.M., Christou E., Learning the Associations of MITRE ATT&CK Adversarial Techniques, (2020); Sood A.K., Enbody R.J., Targeted cyberattacks: A superset of advanced persistent threats, IEEE Secur Priv, 11, 1, pp. 54-61, (2013); Gervasi O., Et al., Computational science and its applications, ICCSA 2015: 15Th International Conference Banff, AB, Canada Proceedings, Part IV, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subser.

Objective The study was performed to identity imaging parameters in non-gated chest CT that differentiate Group 2 from non-Group 2 pulmonary hypertension. Methods Among 158 patients who underwent right heart catheterization for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension, 112 had sufficient data and chest CT for review. Invasive hemodynamic data and numerous variables obtained from axial CT images (maximum diameters of main, right, left pulmonary arteries, ascending aorta, main pulmonary artery to ascending aorta diameter ratio, right atrial diameter, left atrial area and right ventricular size) were collected. CT variables were validated against hemodynamic data to identify parameters that would allow to differentiate pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (Group 2) from non-Group 2 pulmonary hypertension. Results Based on right heart catheterization data, we identified 53 patients with Group 2 pulmonary hypertension, 50 patients with non-Group 2 pulmonary hypertension, and 9 subjects with no pulmonary hypertension. In patients with a dilated pulmonary artery (n = 84), the ROC curve for left atrial area (area under the ROC curve 0.76 ± 0.06) independently distinguished patients with Group 2 pulmonary hypertension (n = 42) from patients with non-Group 2 pulmonary hypertension (n = 42). A dilated left atrium (>20 mm2) in combination with a normal right ventriuclar size had a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 94% for Group 2 pulmonary hypertension. Conclusions In patients with a dilated pulmonary artery on chest CT, left atrial area and right ventricular dimensions may aid to diagnose pulmonary hypertension and to distinguish underlying cardiac disease from other causes. © 2016","Axial chest CT;

These traits include hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose intolerance, endothelial dysfunction, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and generalized and upper body fat redistribution. This cluster is often referred to as insulin resistance syndrome. The progression of insulin resistance to diabetes mellitus parallels the progression of endothelial dysfunction to atherosclerosis leading to cardiovascular disease and its complications. In fact, insulin resistance assessed by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) has shown to be independently predictive of cardiovascular disease in several studies and one unit increase in insulin resistance is associated with a 5.4% increase in cardiovascular disease risk. This review article addresses the role of insulin resistance as a main causal factor in the development of metabolic syndrome and endothelial dysfunction, and its relationship with cardiovascular disease. In addition to this, we review the type of lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy that could possibly ameliorate the effect of insulin resistance and reverse the disturbances in insulin, glucose and lipid metabolism. © 2010 Italian Federation of Cardiology.","adipokines; cardiovascular risk; insulin resistance; metabolic syndrome; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors; thialidazone","Adiponectin; Animals; Atherosclerosis; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; Endothelium, Vascular; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Inflammation; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Leptin; Lipids; Metabolic Syndrome X; Risk Factors; Risk Reduction Behavior; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; biguanide derivative; chromium; chromium chloride; chromium picolinate; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; fibric acid derivative; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; lipid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; metformin; omega 3 fatty acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonist; pioglitazone; protein kinase C inhibitor; rimonabant; rosiglitazone; ruboxistaurin; sibutramine; sitagliptin; tetrahydrolipstatin; triacylglycerol; troglitazone; very low density lipoprotein; vildagliptin; abdominal discomfort; anorexia; atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; blood pressure; body weight; carbohydrate diet; cholesterol blood level; clinical trial; depression; diarrhea; diet; dizziness; drug withdrawal; endothelial dysfunction; endothelium; glucose metabolism; heart death; heart failure; heart infarction; human; inflammation; insulin metabolism; insulin resistance; lactic acidosis; lifestyle modification; lipid metabolism; lipodystrophy; liver toxicity; metabolic syndrome X; mood disorder; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pathogenesis; physical activity; review; side effect; smoking; smoking cessation; weight reduction","","alpha tocopherol, 1406-18-4, 1406-70-8, 52225-20-4, 58-95-7, 59-02-9; ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; chromium, 14092-98-9, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3; chromium chloride, 10049-05-5, 39345-92-1; chromium picolinate, 14639-25-9; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; insulin, 9004-10-8; lipid, 66455-18-3; metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; pioglitazone, 105355-27-9, 111025-46-8; rimonabant, 158681-13-1, 168273-06-1; rosiglitazone, 122320-73-4, 155141-29-0; ruboxistaurin, 169939-93-9, 169939-94-0; sibutramine, 106650-56-0; sitagliptin, 486460-32-6, 654671-78-0; tetrahydrolipstatin, 96829-58-2; troglitazone, 97322-87-7; vildagliptin, 274901-16-5; Adiponectin, ; Blood Glucose, ; Hypoglycemic Agents, ; Insulin, ; Leptin, ; Lipids, ","orlistat","","","","Reaven G.M., Lecture B., 1988 Role of insulin resistance in human disease, Diabetes, 37, pp. 1595-1607, (1988); Rutter M.K., Meigs J.B., Sullivan L.M., D'Agostino Sr. R.B., Wilson P.W., Insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, and incident cardiovascular events in the Framingham Offspring Study, Diabetes, 54, pp. 3252-3257, (2005); Hanley A.J., Williams K., Stern M.P., Haffner S.M., Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in relation to the incidence of cardiovascular disease: The San Antonio Heart Study, Diabetes Care, 25, pp. 1177-1184, (2002); Facchini F.S., Hua N., Abbasi F., Reaven G., Insulin resistance as a predictor of age-related diseases, J Clin Endocrinol, 86, pp. 3574-3578, (2001); Zethelius B., Lithell H., Hales C.N., Berne C., Insulin sensitivity, proinsulin and insulin as predictors of coronary heart disease.

E-learning is known as a learning tool which based on technology to deliver learning material electronically through computer network. The involvement of the students and the lecturers in the existing learning system is not interactive as they use it as a medium to deliver notes and receive notes only. The traditional attendance system which passes the attendance sheet around the class or by calling names is also not productive and time consuming to process the data into attendance statistics. Therefore, an interactive learning system embedded with NFC attendance system using NFC enabled smartphone known as NFC Interactive LEarning System (NILES) is proposed to take attendances and lecturers can conduct their classes in a more interactive way in school, college or university through the usage of social media and blended learning tools. The proposed solution can provide a convenient and portable classroom learning system to the universities and colleges to improve the interaction learning process among students and reduce the workload of lecturers in processing the attendance statistics.

However, issue arises when cyberbullies are able to reach their victims through these social media platforms. There are different types of cyberbullying and like traditional bullying; it causes victims to feel overly selfconscious, increases their tendency to self-harm and generally affects their mental state negatively. Such situations occur due to security issues such as user anonymity and the lack of content restrictions in some social networks or web forums. In this paper, we highlight the existing solutions, which are Intrusion Prevention System and Intrusion Detection System from a number of researchers. However, even with such solutions, cyberbullying acts still occurs at an alarming rate. As such, we proposed an alternative solution that aims to prevent cyberbullying activities at a younger age, e.g., young children. The application would provide an alternative method to preventing cyberbullying activities among the younger generations in the future. © 2017 KIPS.","Cyberbullying; Digital etiquette; Intrusion detection system;

Despite its opportunities and advantages over traditional wireless sensor networks, mobile crowd sensing still faces security and privacy issues, among other challenges. Specifically, the security and privacy of sensitive location information of users remain lingering issues, considering the “on” and “off” state of global positioning system sensor in smartphones. To address this problem, this paper proposes “SenseCrypt”, a framework that automatically annotates and signcrypts sensitive location information of mobile crowd sensing users. The framework relies on K-means algorithm and a certificateless aggregate signcryption scheme (CLASC). It incorporates spatial coding as the data compression technique and message query telemetry transport as the messaging protocol. Results presented in this paper show that the proposed framework incurs low computational cost and communication overhead. Also, the framework is robust against privileged insider attack, replay and forgery attacks. Confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation are security services offered by the proposed framework. © 2020 by the authors.

In human blood, Lp-PLA2 is predominately associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL). This study examines the ability of lifestyle modification (diet and exercise) and combination lipid therapy to reduce Lp-PLA2 levels while also determining the relationship between changes in LDL cholesterol and Lp-PLA2. Thirty dyslipidemic patients who received lifestyle intervention and combination lipid therapy for an average of 6 months were included in these analyses (mean age, 60.9 years); 40% had stable angiographically established coronary artery disease, 40% had the metabolic syndrome, and 70% were men. Drug therapy included omega-3 fish oil, extended-release niaccolesevelam hydrochloride, and a fixed combination of 10-mg ezetimibe and 40-mg simvastatin. The study revealed a 33% reduction in mean Lp-PLA2 values (baseline 224.9±47.5 vs posttreatment 149.5±35.5 ng/mL; P<.001). Significant changes in mean LDL cholesterol from baseline (127.9±49.3 vs posttreatment 65.2±32.1 mg/dL; P<.001) were also observed. However, regression analysis revealed only a weak positive relationship between changes in LDL cholesterol and Lp-PLA2 mass (R2=0.29; P<.01).Thus, Lp-PLA2 mass is significantly reduced with lifestyle and combination lipid therapy. Changes in Lp-PLA2 were only partially explained by the changes observed for LDL cholesterol. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase; Allylamine; Anticholesteremic Agents; Azetidines; Biological Markers; Cholesterol, LDL; Drug Therapy, Combination; Dyslipidemias; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Female; Humans; Inflammation; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Niacin; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Simvastatin; Statistics as Topic; Vitamin B Complex; 1 alkyl 2 acetylglycerophosphocholine esterase; colesevelam; ezetimibe plus simvastatin; hypocholesterolemic agent; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; nicotinic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; adult; aged; angiography; article; clinical article; controlled study; coronary artery disease; dietary intake; dyslipidemia; enzyme activity; exercise; female; human; lifestyle modification; male; metabolic syndrome X; outcome assessment; patient counseling; priority journal; regression analysis; statistical significance; treatment outcome","","colesevelam, 182815-43-6, 182815-44-7; nicotinic acid, 54-86-4, 59-67-6; 1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase, 3.1.1.47; Allylamine, 107-11-9; Anticholesteremic Agents, ; Azetidines, ; Biological Markers, ; Cholesterol, LDL, ; Fatty Acids, Omega-3, ; Niacin, 59-67-6; Simvastatin, 79902-63-9; Vitamin B Complex, 12001-76-2; colesevelam, 182815-44-7; ezetimibe, 163222-33-1","","","","","Garza C.A., Montori V.M., McConnell J.P., Et al., Association between lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 and cardiovascular disease: a systemic review, Mayo Clin Proc, 82, pp. 159-165, (2007); Falk E., Shah P.K., Fuster V., Coronary plaque disruption, Circulation, 92, 3, pp. 657-671, (1995); Hakkinen T., Luoma J.S., Hiltunen M.O., Et al., Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2), platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, is expressed by macrophages in human and rabbit atherosclerotic lesions, Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 19, pp. 2909-2917, (1999); Kolodgie F.D., Burke A.P., Taye A., Et al., Lp-PLA2 is highly expressed in macrophages of coronary lesions prone to rupture, (2004); MacPhee C.H., Moores K.E., Boyd H.F., Et al., Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, generates two bioactive products during the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein: use of a novel inhibitor, Biochem J, 338, pp. 479-487, (1999); Elisaf M., Tselepis A.D., Effect of hypolipidemic drugs on lipoprotein associated platelet activating factor acetlyhydrolase.

Smart home normally is used to fine-tune human’s daily life. However, the main problem is when different devices such as sensors and electrical appliances produced by different manufacturers being used in a smart home. Each device produced by different manufacturer might come with their own set of communication protocol. Therefore, it is important to have a standardized communication protocol for interconnecting and remotely controlling those devices to ensure data can be transmitted to each other. This project aims to present the Smart Home using MEMS Sensor and Ambient Intelligence (SAHOMASI) where in this paper, a standardized communication protocol is proposed to overcome the above problem.

The authors sought to determine its prevalence and association with certain comorbid conditions in a Veterans Affairs population. This cross-sectional study utilized demographic and clinical data from 17,466 patients. Chi-square or t test was used for comparing groups with and without RH. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent associations. Overall, the prevalence of RH was 9%, and 13% of all hypertensive patients met criteria for RH. After adjusting for confounding variables, RH was significantly associated with older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.007), higher body mass index (OR, 1.04), Framingham score (OR, 1.14), and coexisting coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, erectile dysfunction, and metabolic syndrome (OR, 1.3, 1.32, 1.29, 2.88, 2.13, 1.2, 1.12, and 1.2, respectively; all P<.05). Our results indicate a complex interplay of certain comorbid conditions among patients with RH and suggest the need for multifaceted interventions in this high-risk population to prevent cardiovascular events. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antihypertensive Agents; Body Mass Index; California; Cardiovascular Diseases; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Resistance; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Risk Factors; Statistics as Topic; Veterans; antihypertensive agent; age; aged; Article; body mass; cerebrovascular disease; chronic kidney disease; comorbidity; congestive heart failure; coronary artery disease; cross-sectional study; demography; diabetes mellitus; disease association; erectile dysfunction; Framingham risk score; high risk population; human; major clinical study; metabolic syndrome X; peripheral vascular disease; priority journal; resistant hypertension; transient ischemic attack; veteran; Cardiovascular Diseases; comorbidity; drug resistance; female; hypertension; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; risk factor; statistical model; statistics; United States; very elderly","","Antihypertensive Agents, ","","","","","Williams B., Hypertension and the ""J-curve., J Am Coll Cardiol, 54, pp. 1835-1836, (2009); (2014); Egan B.M., Zhao Y., Axon R., US trends in prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, 1988-2008, JAMA, 303, pp. 2043-2050, (2010); Calhoun D.A., Jones D., Textor S., Et al., Resistant hypertension: diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment.
