Designing an accurate and effective pre-crash system to avoid front and back crashes or mitigating crash severity is the priority goal of any vehicle safety system. To improve crash prediction, vehicle context is collected to analyze the severity of a crash based on safe avoidance time between two vehicles. This work proposes a real time crash prediction based on TGFD Crash Severity Factor model for Periodic Safety Message dissemination protocol in VANET. Simulation results show promising improvements for dissemination of PSMs to the vehicles for prevention of road accidents in highway scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.","Collision avoidance; Crash prediction; Safety message dissemination; Vanet","Collision avoidance; Forecasting; Highway accidents; Information dissemination; Roads and streets; Safety factor; Vehicles; Crash avoidance; Crash prediction; Crash severity; Prevention of road accidents; Safety message disseminations; Vanet; Vehicle safety; Vehicle safety systems; Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","","MAXIS-USM, (304/PKOMP/650804/M151)","This research work is fully funded by a MAXIS-USM research grant (304/PKOMP/650804/M151)","Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015, (2015); McDonald M., Keller H., Klijnhout J., Mauro V., Hall R., Spence A., Fakler O., Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe: Opportunities for Future Research, (2006); Leondes C.T., Intelligent knowledge-based systems: Business and technology in the new millennium, Springer Science & Business Media, (2010); Hartenstein H., Laberteaux K., VANET: Vehicular Applications and Inter-networking Technologies, 1, (2009); Fadilah S.I., Shariff A.R.M., A time gap interval for safe following distance (TGFD) in avoiding car collision in wireless vehicular networks (VANET) envi-ronment, Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation (ISMS), 2014 5th International Conference on, pp. 683-689, (2014); Sperling D., Pike S., Chase R., Will the transportation revolutions improve our lives-or make them worse, Three Revolutions, pp. 1-20, (2018); Liu Z., Ge H., Cheng R., KdV-Burgers equation in the modified continuum model considering the effect of friction and radius on a curved road, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, (2018); Dargay J., Gately D., Income's effect on car and vehicle ownership, worldwide: 1960-2015, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 33, 2, pp. 101-138, (1999); Schafer A., Victor D.G., The future mobility of the world population, Transpor-tation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 34, 3, pp. 171-205, (2000); Gerla M., Kleinrock L., Vehicular networks and the future of the mobile internet, Computer Networks, 55, 2, pp. 457-469, (2011); Peden M., World Report on Road Traffic Injury Preventio Motorola Semiconductor Data Manual, Motorola Semiconductor Products Inc, (2004); Minderhoud M.M., Bovy P.H., Extended time-tocollision measures for road traffic safety assessment, Accident Analysis & Prevention, 33, 1, pp. 89-97, (2001); (2009); Godbole D., Sengupta R., Misener J., Kourjanskaia N., Michael J., Benefit evaluation of crash avoidance systems, Transportation Research, 1621, 1, pp. 1-9, (1998)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","89th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, VTC Spring 2019","28 April 2019 through 1 May 2019","Kuala Lumpur","149083","15502252","978-172811217-6","IVTCD","","English","IEEE Veh Technol Conf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068986443"

However, several issues due to the dynamic nature of VANETs disrupt the efficiency of safety message dissemination. Clustering is a common solution applied to overcome VANET challenges. If a Cluster Head is exposed to accidents, it would lose its role and disband the cluster. When re-clustering happens frequently, a greater amount of overhead is produced. This work presents a modified version of the original Safe Clustering Algorithm (M-SCA) whereby safety distance is applied in the cluster maintenance stage to extend the cluster phase. NS2 simulation is conducted to measure the performance of the proposed scheme under QoS parameters, emergency message inter-arrival time, and overhead. © 2017 IEEE.","cluster; safety distance; VANET","Alarm systems; Highway accidents; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Cluster; Cluster-heads; Clusterings; Collision warning system; Cooperative collision warning; Dynamic nature; Safety distances; Safety message disseminations; VANET; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Clustering algorithms","","","","","","","Almalag M.S., Olariu S., Weigle M.C., Tdma cluster-based mac for vanets (tc-mac), World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM), 2012 IEEE International Symposiumon A, pp. 1-6, (2012); AlMheiri S.M., AlQamzi H.S., MANETs andVANETs clustering algorithms: A survey, GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCCCE), 2015 IEEE 8th, pp. 1-6, (2015); Aissa M., Arafah B., Henchiri M., Safe Clustering Algorithm in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks; Balon N., Introduction to Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks and the BroadcastStorm Problem; Basu P., Khan N., Little T.D., A mobility basedmetric for clustering in mobile ad hoc networks, Distributedcomputing Systems Workshop, 2001 International Conference on, pp. 413-418, (2001); Cha S.H., A survey of broadcast protocols for vehicular ad-hocnetworks, SmartCR, 4, 4, pp. 246-255, (2014); Fadilah S.I., Rahman A., A Novel Adaptive Time Gap BasedCongestion Control for Vehicular Ad Hoc Network, (2006); Fadilah S.I., Shariff A.R.M., A time gap intervalfor safe following distance (tgfd) in avoiding car collision in wireless vehicular networks (vanet) environment, IntelligentSystems, Modelling and Simulation (ISMS), 2014 5th InternationalConference on, pp. 683-689, (2014); Goonewardene R.T., Ali F.H., Stipidis E.L.I.A.S., Robust mobility adaptive clustering scheme with support for geographicrouting for vehicular ad hoc networks, IET Intelligent TransportSystems, 3, 2, pp. 148-158, (2009); Gupta N., Prakash A., Tripathi R., Adaptive beaconing in mobility aware clustering based mac protocol for safety messagedissemination in vanet, Wireless Communications and MobileComputing, 2017, (2017); Jiang D., Taliwal V., Meier A., Holfelder W., Herrtwich R., Design of 5.9 GHz DSRC-based vehicular safety communication, IEEEWireless Communications, 13, 5, (2006); Khan A.A., An Evolutionary Game Theoretic Approach for Stableclustering in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) (Doctoraldissertation), (2015); Kuklinski S., Wolny G., Density based clustering algorithm for VANETs, Testbeds and Research Infrastructures for the Development of Networks &Communities and Workshops, 2009.TridentCom 2009. 5th International Conference on, pp. 1-6, (2009); Kumar V., Mishra S., Chand N., Applications of VANETs: Present &future, Communications and Network, 5, 1, (2013); Moustafa H., Senouci S.M., Jerbi M., Introduction tovehicular networks, Vehicular Networks, 1, (2009); Najafzadeh S., Ithnin N.B., Abd Razak S., Broadcasting in connected and fragmented vehicular ad hoc networks, InternationalJournal of Vehicular Technology, 2014, (2014); Nguyen V., Kim O.T.T., Dang D.N.M., Kim S.S., Hong C.S., Application of the lowest-ID algorithm in cluster-basedTDMA system for VANETs, Information Networking (ICOIN), 2015International Conference on, pp. 25-30, (2015); Rawashdeh Z.Y., Mahmud S.M., Media accesstechnique for cluster-based vehicular ad hoc networks, VehicularTechnology Conference, 2008.

As COVID-19 is still highly infectious despite the availability of vaccines, the implementation of contactless Internet of Things (IoT) technology should be encouraged to minimize the need for medical staff to perform daily health checks and thus prevent them from being directly infected during checking. This research aims to develop an effective method to monitor quarantined individuals regarding their vital signs, such as body temperature, heart rate, and oxygen level. A contactless self-monitoring tool integrated with a stages algorithm is developed to monitor these quarantined individuals with the help of IoT technology. It can provide a consistent platform for patients or users to transfer information or data through networks, including personalized healthcare domains. COV-SMT is an effective tool to streamlet the overall process of taking measurements from quarantined individuals. It integrates multiple sensors into one tool while providing a better overall picture with its graphical presentation to help patients and medical staff better understand their health conditions. © 2023, International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies.

While simulation tools provide a simple and inexpensive method to gain an understanding of algorithms and protocols in MANET research, its reliability and accuracy in representing real systems and contexts are critically limited. Thus, this paper unveils the ToMRobot, created with low budget using ordinary remote control (RC) car coupled with a few low cost electronic components, to serve as a fully functional MANET testbed. Provided in this paper are practical knowhow to model and produce ToMRobot from scratch specifically targeted to facilitate less technical savvy MANET researchers. Despite being really economical, significantly inexpensive to create, highly customizable with flexible option that allows researchers to upgrade by utilizing components such as Arduino and Cubieboard2 from technologies that can be sourced from open hardware, ToMRobot still maintains all aspects of MANET rudimentary structures. It is hoped that the guidelines contained within this paper will help MANET researchers to build robots that can be used in their future MANET testbeds, which will in turn ultimately increase the number of MANET researchers who choose testbeds as their evaluation tool. © 2018 IEEE.","MANET detailed; Mobile Ad hoc Network; real mobility; real-testbed","Budget control; Costs; Grid computing; Remote control; Technology transfer; Testbeds; Algorithms and protocols; Evaluation tool; Low-cost electronics; Low-cost robots; MANET detailed; Manet testbed; Open hardware; Rudimentary structures; Mobile ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Lenders V., Wagner J., May M., Analyzing the impact of mobility in ad hoc networks, Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Multi-Hop Ad Hoc Networks: From Theory to Reality, REALMAN '06, pp. 39-46, (2006); Amjad K., From simulation to testbed: An, indoor MANET performance analysis study, Antennas and Propagation Conference (LAPC 2012) Loughborough, pp. 1-4, (2012); Benmoshe B., Berliner E., Dvir A., Performance monitoring framework for Wi-Fi MANET, 2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC 2013), pp. 4463-4468; Cuervo E., Gilbert P., Wu B., Cox L., CrowdLab: An architecture for volunteer mobile testbeds, 2011 Third International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS 2011, pp. 1-10, (2011); Do V.T.M., Landmark L., Kure O., Testbed-based performance evaluation of a connectionless multicast protocol for MANETs, 2014 11th International Symposium on Wireless Communications Systems (ISWCS 2014), pp. 276-281, (2014); Hiyama M., Kulla E., Oda T., Ikeda M., Barolli L., Experimental results, of a MANET testbed in a mixed environment considering horizontal and vertical topologies, 2012 IEEE 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA 2012), pp. 884-889, (2012); Kulla E., Sakamoto S., Ikeda M., Barolli L., Xhafa F., Kamo B., Evaluation of a MANET, testbed for central bridge and V-shape bridge scenarios using BATMAN routing protocol, 2013 Eighth International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA 2013), pp. 199-205, (2013); Kulla E., Ikeda M., Oda T., Barolli L., Xhafa F., Takizawa M., Multimedia transmissions, over a MANET Testbed: Problems and Issues, 2012 Sixth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems (CISIS 2012), pp. 141-147, (2012); Messeguer R., Ochoa S.F., Pino J.A., Medina E., Navarro L., Royo D., Neyem A., Building real-World Ad-Hoc networks to support mobile collaborative applications: Lessons learned, Groupware: Design, Implementation, 5784, pp. 1-16, (2009); Panaousis E.A., Drew G., Millar G.P., Ramrekha T.A., Politis C., A Testbed Implementation for Securing OLSR in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, (2010); Rensfelt O., Hermans F., Gunningberg P., Larzon L.A., Bjornemo E., Repeatable experiments with mobile nodes in a relocatable WSN testbed, Comput.

The standards from European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) for Intelligent Transport System (ITS) provide necessary upper-layer specifications for safety message dissemination between vehicles using Cooperative Aware Messages (CAM) and Decentralized Event Notification Message (DENM). Besides, mobile radio technology of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) in Release-14 comes with two modes of communication, which is mode 3 and mode 4 to support vehicle to vehicle communications. The relationship between vehicle time gap, speed, and UE transmit power significantly impacts the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and throughput. With higher vehicle moving speeds, longer safe distances must be kept in ensuring safety. However, at longer safe distances, we have proven that communication may be lost because CAM messages cannot be exchanged successfully. As a result, no vehicle safety can be guaranteed using V2V communication. This may get worse in urban or cities environment where interference is dominant. Simulation results provide evidence that variable distance between vehicles cannot be ignored to ensure vehicle safety with successful message communication among them © 2022.

Drivers control the vehicle directly or supervise the situation according to information displayed on the instrument panel. Different from the time-headway and traditional braking models, this paper aims to propose a new safety indicator called time gap interval for safe following distance (TGFD) which incorporates vehicle dynamics and driver behavior factors that includes the time component to broadcast and propagate suitable safety messages in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) environment. This simulation-based safety indicator could analyze the capability of a vehicle in a car-following situation to safely stop without hitting the vehicle in front when an emergency brake is applied by considering the proper reaction time of the driver of the following. Results from this simulation study indicate that the TGFD is more comprehensive safety indicator for safety analysis. © 2014 IEEE.","Collision Avoidance; Safe Distance; Time Gap; VANET","Collision avoidance; Intelligent systems; Traffic control; Vehicles; Dynamic cooperation; Safe distance; Safety indicator; Simulation studies; Time gap; VANET; Vehicle dynamics; Wireless vehicular networks; Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Brackstone M., McDonald M., Car-following: A historical review, Transportation Research Part F, 2, 4, pp. 181-196, (1999); Gipps P.G., A behavioural car-following model for computer simulation, Transportation Research Part B, 15, 2, pp. 105-111, (1981); Werling M., Kaempchen N., Wollherr D., Buss M., Lanebased safety assessment of road scenes using Inevitable Collision States, Proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV '12), pp. 31-36, (2012); Adell E., Varhelyi A., Fontana M.D., The effects of adriver assistance system for safe speed and safe distance- A real-life field study, Transportation Research Part C, 19, 1, pp. 145-155, (2011); Kannan S., Thangavelu A., Kalivaradhan R.B., An intelligent driver assistance system (I-DAS) for vehicle safety modelling using ontology approach, International Journal of UbiComp, 1, 3, pp. 15-29, (2010); Biral F., Da Lio M., Saroldi A., Tango F., Bertolazzi E., Supporting drivers in keeping safe speed and safe distance: The SASPENCE subproject within the European framework programme 6 integrating project PReVENT, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 11, 3, pp. 525-538, (2010); Wu Y., Xie J., Du L., Hou Z., Analysis on trafficsafety distance of considering the deceleration of the current vehicle, InProceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Computing Technology and Automation (ICICTA '09), pp. 491-494, (2009); Luo Q., Xun L., Cao Z., Huang Y., Simulation analysis and study on car-following safety distance model based on braking process of leading vehicle, InProceedings of the of 9th World Congress OnIntelligent Control and Automation (WCICA'11), pp. 740-743, (2011); Ayres T.J., Li L., Schleuning D., Young D., Preferred timeheadway of highway drivers, Proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Proceedings, pp. 826-829, (2001); Touran A., Brackstone M.A., McDonald M., A collision model for safety evaluation of autonomous intelligent cruise control, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 31, 5, pp. 567-578, (1999); Tordeux A., Lassarre S., Roussignol A.N.D.M., An adaptive t ime-g a p car-following model, Transportation Research Part B : Methodological, 44, 8-9, pp. 1115-1131, (2010); Lin T., Hwang S., Green P., Effects of time-gap settings of adaptive cruise control (acc) on driving performance and subjective acceptance in a bus driving simulator, Safety Science, 47, 5, pp. 620-625, (2009); Karim M.R., Et al., Minimum safe time gap (MSTG) as a new safety indicator incorporating vehicle and driver factors, Proceedings of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 9, (2013); McGee, Et al., Highway Design and Operation Standards Affected by Driver Characteristics, 2, (1983)","","Al-Dabass D.; Sauli Z.; Zakaria Z.","IEEE Computer Society","","5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation, ISMS 2014","27 January 2014 through 29 January 2014","Langkawi","117206","21660662","978-147993857-5","","","English","Proc. - Int.

This has profoundly disrupted the hands-on lab face-to-face learning process that is harder to be moved online. Virtual simulation lab could be the answer and its use in many courses has been extensively studied. However, it is relatively little studied when it comes to land surveying courses. The purpose of the study is to explore the learning effectiveness of virtual surveying field lab for blended open distance learning (ODL) students at Wawasan Open University (WOU) in the time of Covid-19. This study used a mixed-method that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches to get a fuller picture and deeper meaning of learning behavior while using descriptive and inferential statistical methods in SPSS platform. Respondents were selected using the purposive sampling method. Survey questionnaires were designed and distributed to students before and after lab simulation class. Instructors were interviewed after the lab simulation class. Students' learning results for the surveying course were compared with the past-year examination results at pre-Covid-19 times before the virtual simulator was introduced. Both qualitative and quantitative data set were collected and analyzed. The findings revealed that the virtual simulator has enhanced students' learning interest and efficiency for surveying course in a ODL setting. Both students and instructors have responded positively towards the virtual simulator learning experiences. Students' achievement in the final examination amid Covid-19 was better than pre-Covid-19 performance. It is recommended that the virtual simulator shouldn't be a replacement to physical instrument but as a complement. © 2022.

We present in this paper a cooperative and fully distributed congestion control approach, based on time gap, to adaptively control the PSM generation rate. Using the measured time gap of the neighbor vehicles in the same lane, the periodic safety message (PSM) generation rate is controlled in order to reduce the congestion, keeping the safety of the vehicles intact. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Congestion control; Safety; Time gap; VANET","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6313023)","The authors would like to acknowledge Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for supporting this work under USM Short term Grant Scheme No. 304/PKOMP/6313023.","Morgan Y.L., Notes on DSRC & WAVE Standards Suite: Its Architecture, Design, and Characteristics, Commun.

Vehicle to vehicle communications (V2V) is the pivotal enabler in 5G-V2X by allowing the exchange of Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) over the Physical Sidelink Shared Channel (PSSCH). In this paper, we modeled the performance of the 5G V2V PSSCH capacity limits based on different CAM payload sizes and vehicle densities using M/G/1 queuing theory and Newton Raphson (N-R) method. Results proved that 5G V2V cell capacity demands is in the order of multiple Gbps. PSSCH message should be kept below 1500 bytes to ensure moderate capacity demands below 1 Gbps limit. For any given practical 5G V2V system vehicle densities, size of CAM data payload and generation times will influence capacity limits. System capacity increase with increasing PSSCH message sizes and number of vehicles arriving into the system, with PSSCH message sizes being the more dominant contributor. Average capacity growth is larger in the 1000 to 1500 bytes region of about 130% as compared to higher PSSCH message size regions. The results ultimately presents important understanding on the relation between different CAM payload sizes and the resultant PSSCH message sizes, and their impact on total system capacities. © 2023 THE AUTHORS","5G V2V Sidelink; CAM packet size; Capacity limit; M/G/1; Newton Raphson; PSSCH","5G mobile communication systems; Cams; Cooperative communication; Numerical methods; Vehicle safety; Vehicle to Everything; 5g V2V sidelink; Capacity limit; Channel's capacity; Cooperative awareness message packet size; M/G/1; Newton raphson; Newton-Raphson's method; Packet size; Physical sidelink shared channel; Shared channel; Vehicle to vehicle communications","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2014/ICT03/USM/02/1)","Acknowledgment to “ Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with Project Code: FRGS/1/2014/ICT03/USM/02/1 ”.","Scarlet D., The 5G Evolution, J.

Many simulations in VANET develop only message dissemination protocol without considering the safe time needed between moving vehicles and these are rather inaccurate for safety preventions because communications without an effective time gap between vehicles could still lead to collisions. Passenger vehicles avoidance time can be associated with L0-L2 and L3-L5 levels of autonomy, dependent on either human-induced deceleration braking or full automated system braking. Two passenger vehicle avoidance time models have been proposed. The results obtained shows marked differences in the needed avoidance time for safe vehicle braking to avoid a crash. A delay of 4s is suggested to maintain a suitable avoidance time between leading and following vehicles for CAVs in urban and highway roads. © 2019 IEEE.","Autonomous; Avoidance time; CAV; TGFD; VANET","Accidents; Automation; Autonomous vehicles; Automated systems; Autonomous; Autonomous vehicle technologies; Avoidance time; Message dissemination; Passenger vehicles; TGFD; VANET; Vehicle to vehicle communications","","","","","University of Southern Maine, USM, (304/PKOMP/650804/M151)","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research work is fully funded by a USM research grant (304/PKOMP/650804/M151).","Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018, (2018); Violence W.H.O.D.O., Prevention I., Violence W.H.O., Prevention I., Global Status Report on Road Safety: Time for Action, (2009); Singh H., Dhattarwal S., Pattern and distribution of injuries in fatal road traffic accidents in Rohtak (haryana), JIAFM, 26, pp. 20-23, (2004); Suriyapaiboonwattana K., Pornavalai C., Chakraborty G., An adaptive alert message dissemination protocol for vanet to improve road safety, 2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, pp. 1639-1644, (2009); Cheng H.T., Shan H., Zhuang W., Infotainment and road safety service support in vehicular networking: From a communication perspective, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 25, pp. 2020-2038, (2011); Bishop R., Intelligent vehicle applications worldwide, IEEE Intelligent Systems and Their Applications, 15, pp. 78-81, (2000); Kumar S.S., Vehicular ad hoc network, World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, International Journal of Computer, Electrical, Automation, Control and Information Engineering, 8, pp. 627-630, (2014); Hartenstein H., Laberteaux L., A tutorial survey on vehicular ad hoc networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 46, (2008); ElBatt T., Goel S.K., Holland G., Krishnan H., Parikh J., Cooperative collision warning using dedicated short range wireless communications, Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks, pp. 1-9, (2006); Li W., Wu J., Ma X., Zhang Z., On reliability requirement for bsm broadcast for safety applications in dsrc system, 2014 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium Proceedings, pp. 946-950, (2014); Mejri M.N., Ben-Othman J., Hamdi M., Survey on vanet security challenges and possible cryptographic solutions, Vehicular Communications, 1, pp. 53-66, (2014); Eze E.C., Zhang S., Liu E., Vehicular ad hoc networks (vanets): Current state, challenges, potentials and way forward, 2014 20th International Conference on Automation and Computing, pp. 176-181, (2014); Reuse F.-B., Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, (2018); Society of Automative Engineers; Abe M., Vehicle Handling Dynamics: Theory and Application, (2015); Cervero R., Linking urban transport and land use in developing countries, Journal of Transport and Land Use, 6, pp. 7-24, (2013); Delpiano R., Herrera J.M., Coeymans J.A., Characteristics of lateral vehicle interaction, Transportmetrica A: Transport Science, 11, pp. 636-647, (2015); Ranney T.A., Psychological factors that influence car-following and car-following model development, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 2, pp. 213-219, (1999); Rothery R.W., Car following Models, (1992); May A.D., Traffic Flow Fundamentals, 7632, (1990); Gipps P.G., A behavioural car-following model for computer simulation, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 15, pp. 105-111, (1981); Braskstone M., McDonald M., Car Following: A Historical Review, Transportation Research Part F. 2, (2000); Fadilah S.I., Shariff A.R.M., A time gap interval for safe following distance (tgfd) in avoiding car collision in wireless vehicular networks (vanet) environment, Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation (ISMS), 2014 5th International Conference on, pp. 683-689, (2014); Green M., How long does it take to stop?

In the emerging global economy, e-business has increasingly become a necessary component of business strategy and a strong catalyst for economic development. In near future, vehicles may be equipped with short-range radios capable of communicating with other vehicles and highway infrastructure using a VANET. Mobile Advertisement is a location-aware dissemination solution built on top of a vehicular ad-hoc network. We envision a network of 802.11p that dynamically disseminate data to clients running on the car's smart device. The approach can be considered an alternative to the static advertisement billboards and can be useful to business companies wanting to dynamically advertise their products and offers to people driving their car. The clients can subscribe to information based on specific topics. We present design solutions that use RSU in 802.11p network for transmitting messages to wireless-enabled devices equipped on vehicles. We also present implementation details for the evaluation of the proposed solution using a simulator designed for VANET application. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Advertisements dissemination; CCH utilization; VANET; VCAD","","","","","","","","Web gives birth to banner ads, (2010); Google annual report, (2011); Batista P.J., Sacasas R., Telemarketing and the TCPA: Let the seller beware, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 31, 1, pp. 97-98, (2003); IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report-Full Year, (2011); Harteinstein H., Labertaux K.P., VANET Vehicular Applications and Inter-Networking Technologies, (2010); Lind R., Et al., The Network Vehicle-a glimpse into the future of mobile multi-media, (1999); Abboud K., Zhuang W., Modeling and analysis for emergency messaging delay in vehicular ad hoc networks, Proceedings of the IEEE GLOBECOM, (2009); Toor Y., Muhlethaler P., Laouiti A., de La Fortelle A., Vehicle ad hoc networks: applications and related technical issues, IEEE Commun.

The evolution of 5G V2X enhances the physical layer of LTE V2X in terms of resource allocation, frame structure, and many more. The amendments in the physical layer are to enable the exchange of safety and advanced driving services within a geographical area. The introduction of 25 use cases in the 3GPP Release 15 standard with different quality of service (QoS) requirements and high demand for data rates makes it possible for the enhancements. Delivering the services of the established use cases becomes a challenge in 5G-V2V communication. Release 14 and release 15 mark the evolution of LTE V2X, while Release 16 highlights 3GPP advancements for 5G V2X NR services, and Release 17 focuses on future enhancements with the applications of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study examines sidelink communication, resource allocation for LTE V2V and 5G-V2V, and NR V2X enablers such as Network Slicing (NS) and Machine Learning (ML) with recent capacity studies on V2V employing the two 5G enablers. In 5G-V2V Sidelink communication, Physical Sidelink Shared Channel (PSSCH) is responsible for broadcasting various messages using release 14 and release 16 waveforms. The capacity of PSSCH to broadcast the 5G services, such as Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM), Decentralized Environmental Messages (DENM), Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) contents for environmental perception, and sensor DATA applications for driving intention, becomes a challenge. This study considered this challenge by providing a mathematical model of the capacity of V2V and V2I links in the 5G V2X network for mode selection using the Poisson point process and Poisson line process within a circular region. © 2022 Lavoisier.

The system is aimed at reducing fatal crashes caused by driver’s drowsiness and distraction. For drowsiness, the system operates by analysing eye blinks and yawn frequency of the driver while for distraction, the system works based on the head pose estimation and eye tracking. The alarm will be triggered if any of these conditions occur. Main part of the implementation of this system will be using python with computer vision, while Raspberry Pi, which is uniquely designed, for the hardware platform and the speaker for alarming. In short, this driver drowsiness monitoring system can always monitor drivers so as to avoid accidents in real time. © 2022.

The hop-count is derived by identifying the next-hop node that has the minimum distance to the sink node. Meanwhile, the node-degree is obtained through the vehicle ID of each neighbouring nodes in its radius. All the nodes or vehicles in VANETs context were assumed to be equipped with an OnBoard Unit (OBU) that will periodically send beacon messages to other nodes around the transmission range area. From the simulation results, it is found that the HDbR protocol is suitable to be used in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) as it produces high network throughput and minimum end-to-end delay. Thus it is comparable to existing protocol such as AODV when it was evaluated in various speeds scenario. © 2013 IEEE.","hop-count; node-degree; routing protocol; VANETs","Routing protocols; Vehicle transmissions; End to end delay; High network throughput; Hopcount; Neighbouring nodes; node-degree; Transmission ranges; VANETs; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Spaho E., Barolli L., Mino G., Xhafa F., Kolici V., Vanet simulators: A survey on mobility and routing protocols, Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA), International Conference, pp. 1-10, (2011); Shariff A.R.M., A Novel Topology Dependent Model for Hop-by-Hop Routing Using Static Metrics, (2007); Perkins C., Royer E., Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector rout-ing, Mobile Computing Systems and Applications.

Although, these devices have been replaced the traditional wired systems and contribute in solving the high cost of such systems, there are drawbacks been emerged. The major disadvantages are the range limitation of Bluetooth module and the line of sight problem of IrDa device. A ZigBee is low cost and low power consumption wireless technology. It has a higher connectivity range than Bluetooth and doesn’t have line of sight problem. In this paper, an application model using ZigBee wireless remote controlling and data acquisition device as well as the use of internet connection to enable the device to be used worldwide is presented. Such system has several benefits such as portable, long wireless range, low power consumption, low cost and can be used worldwide using internet.
