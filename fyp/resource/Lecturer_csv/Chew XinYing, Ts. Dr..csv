However, due to its complexity and uncertainty, how to effectively perform real-time prediction is an important challenge. This paper proposes a smart grid real-time prediction model based on the attention mechanism of convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with bi-directional long and short-term memory BiLSTM.The model has stronger spatiotemporal feature extraction capability, more accurate prediction capability and better adaptability than ARMA and decision trees. The traditional prediction models ARMA and decision tree can often only use simple statistical methods for prediction, which cannot meet the requirements of high accuracy and efficiency of real-time load prediction, so the CNN-BiLSTM model based on Bayesian optimisation has the following advantages and is more suitable for smart grid real-time load prediction compared with ARMA and decision tree. CNN is a hierarchical neural network structure containing several layers such as a convolutional layer, pooling layer and fully connected layer. The convolutional layer is mainly used for extracting features from data such as images, the pooling layer is used for the dimensionality reduction of features, and the fully connected layer is used for classification and recognition. The core of CNN is the convolutional operation, a locally weighted summation operation on the input data that can effectively extract features from the data. In the convolution operation, different features can be extracted by setting different convolution kernels to achieve feature extraction and classification of data. BiLSTM can capture semantic dependencies in both directions. The BiLSTM structure consists of two LSTM layers that process the input sequence in the forward and backward directions to combine the information in both directions to obtain more comprehensive contextual information. BiLSTM can access both the front and back inputs at each time step to obtain more accurate prediction results. It effectively prevents gradient explosion and gradient disappearance while better capturing longer-distance dependencies. The CNN-BiLSTM extracts features of the data and then optimises them by Bayes. By collecting real-time data from the power system, including power, load, weather and other factors, our model uses the features of CNN-BiLSTM to deeply learn real-time load data from smart grids and extract key features to achieve future load prediction. Meanwhile, the Bayesian optimisation algorithm based on the model can optimise the model’s hyperparameters, thus improving the model’s prediction performance. The model can achieve accurate prediction of a real-time power system load, provide an important reference for the dispatch and operation of the power system, and help optimise the operation efficiency and energy utilisation efficiency of the power system.

Data analytics paved the way for a significant number of research and development in various fields including medicine and vaccine development, DNA analysis, artificial intelligence and many more. Data plays a very important role in providing the required results and helps in making critical decisions and predictions. However, ethical and legislative restrictions sometimes make it difficult for scientists to acquire data. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, data was very limited due to privacy and regulatory issues. To address data unavailability, data scientists usually leverage machine learning algorithms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to augment data from existing samples. Today, there are over 450 algorithms that are designed to re-generate or augment data in case of unavailability of the data. With many algorithms in the market, it is practically impossible to predict which algorithm best fits the problem in question, unless many algorithms are tested. In this study, we select the most common types of GAN algorithms available for image augmentation to generate samples capable of representing a whole data distribution. To test the selected models, we used two unique datasets, namely COVID-19 CT images and COVID-19 X-Ray images. Five different GAN algorithms, namely CGAN, DCGAN, f-GAN, WGAN, and CycleGAN, were selected and applied to the samples to see how each algorithm reacts to the samples. To evaluate their performances, Visual Turing Test (VTT) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) were used. The VTT result shows that a human expert can accurately distinguish between different samples that were produced. Hence, CycleGAN scored 80% in CT image dataset and 77% in X-Ray image dataset. In contrast, the FID result revealed that CycleGAN had a high convergence and therefore generated high quality and clearer images on both datasets compared to CGAN, DCGAN, f-GAN, and WGAN. This study concluded that the CycleGAN model is the best when it comes to image augmentation due to its friendliness and high convergence.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

In addition, the strength of the relationship between these factors and the perception of ethics of social commerce platforms was determined by the mediating role of the perceived risk of ethical violations. To this end, this study complements academic literature by integrating structural equation modeling (SEM) and multi criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques. In order to complete the strategic decisive solution, this study uses a survey to collect data from customers of rural communities in Malaysia and Turkey. The results demonstrate that perceived risk of ethical violations has a partial mediating role in the relationship between dependent variables and the perception of ethics of social commerce platforms for Malaysia and Turkey. Benchmarking and ranking customers from best to worst based on the perception of ethics of social commerce would identify customers with a high perception of the ethics of social commerce platforms and motivate them as opinion leaders of such platforms. Contrarily, social commerce platforms can treat worst-ranked customers with caution and strive to turn a negative perception into positive ethics. Besides, the cross-cluster study at the level of Asia and Europe would contribute to the literature to identify insights into the differences and similarities between the Asian and European contexts based on multiple and diverse cultures regarding social commerce ethics of rural communities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Ethics of Social Commerce; Multi-Criteria Decision Making; Perceived Risk of Ethical Violations; Rural Communities; Social Support","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315616)","This work is funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia, Short Term Grant [Grant Number: 304/PKOMP/6315616], for the Project entitled “New Coefficient of Variation Control Charts based on Variable Charting Statistics in Industry 4.0 for the Quality Smart Manufacturing and Services”.

The fact that the ratio of the majorities is higher than the minorities will lead to misleading results as conventional machine learning algorithms were designed on the assumption of equal class distribution. The purpose of this study is to build a hybrid data preprocessing approach to deal with the class imbalance issue by applying resampling approaches and CSL for fraud detection using a real-world dataset. The proposed hybrid approach consists of two steps in which the first step is to compare several resampling approaches to find the optimum technique with the highest performance in the validation set. While the second method used CSL with optimal weight ratio on the resampled data from the first step. The hybrid technique was found to have a positive impact of 0.987, 0.974, 0.847, 0.853 F2-measure for RF, DT, XGBOOST and LGBM, respectively. Additionally, relative to the conventional methods, it obtained the highest performance for prediction. © 2022 Slovak Academy of Sciences.

Implementing variable sampling interval (VSI) control schemes on control charts rather than traditional fixed sampling interval procedure can significantly improve the control chart's efficiency. In this paper, the VSI run sum (RS) Hotelling's χ2 chart is proposed. The optimal scores and parameters of the proposed chart are determined using an optimization technique to minimize the following: (i) out-of-control average time to signal (ATS); (ii) adjusted ATS (AATS), when the exact shift size can be specified; (iii) expected ATS; or (iv) expected AATS, when the exact shift size cannot be specified. The Markov chain method is used to evaluate the zero-state ATS and expected ATS, and steady-state AATS and expected AATS of the proposed chart. The results show that the VSI RS Hotelling's χ2 chart significantly outperforms the standard RS Hotelling's χ2 chart and the former also performs well compared with other competing charts. By adding more scoring regions, the efficiency of the VSI RS Hotelling's χ2 chart can be further enhanced. An illustrative example using data from a manufacturing process is presented to demonstrate the application of the VSI RS Hotelling's χ2 chart. The application of the proposed chart in a quality improvement program can be extended to management and service industries. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This process is managed by a compute farm scheduler, which handles job scheduling based on the availability of such computational resources as central processing units, memory, and storage. The increasing complexity of chip design over the years, combined with a growing number of cores per chip, has resulted in memory-intensive applications often being executed as compute jobs. Jobs submitted with inaccurate resource-related requests, especially those concerning memory, can overload a compute farm and lead to wasted resources. This study addresses this issue by using a data science-driven, machine learningbased approach to predict the memory required for a compute job at the time of its submission. Improving the accuracy of such predictions can significantly reduce the overall wait times of jobs and enable efficient use of the compute farm to reduce the overall cost because fewer machines are required to complete a set of jobs. We explored the use of the K-nearest neighbor, random forest, and ensemble methods to this end. The proposed approach yielded an accuracy of 80% in experiments, where this demonstrates the success of predicting the memory-related requirements of compute jobs across a diverse suite of applications used in the process of chip design. © 2023 The Authors.","Chip design; Compute farm scheduler; Machine learning algorithms; Memory prediction; Resource management","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/STG06/USM/02/6)","This work is supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia, Fundamental and Research Grant Scheme under Grant No. FRGS/1/2019/STG06/USM/02/6 for the project entitled “A New Hybrid Model for Monitoring the Multivariate Coefficient of Variation in Healthcare Surveillance”.","Speed to market: Why is it so important?, (2022); ASIC vs FPGA: What's the difference?, (2020); Reuther A., Et al., Scheduler technologies in support of high performance data analysis, 2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference HPEC 2016, pp. 1-6, (2016); Tanash M., Andresen D., Hsu W., AMPRO-HPCC: A machine-learning tool for predicting resources on slurm HPC clusters, ADVCOMP International Conference on Advanced Engineering Computing and Applications in Sciences, pp. 20-27, (2021); Taghavi T., Lupetini M., Kretchmer Y., Compute job memory recommender system using machine learning, Proceedings ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 609-616, (2016); Tanash M., Dunn B., Andresen D., Hsu W., Yang H., Okanlawon A., Improving HPC system performance by predicting job resources via supervised machine learning, ACM International Conference Proceedings Series, pp. 1-8, (2019); Li X., Qi N., He Y., McMillan B., Practical resource usage prediction method for large memory jobs in HPC clusters, Asian Conference on Supercomputing Frontiers, pp. 1-18, (2019); Salehian S., Lu L., Memory bandwidth prediction in NUMA architecture using supervised machine learning, International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI 2019), pp. 1517-1522, (2019); Oliveira D., Moreira F.

In recent years, the finite horizon process is commonly encountered in industries due to flexible manufacturing production. Past research works on finite horizon process monitoring are still limited. Because of this, three run rules Hotelling's T2 charts are proposed to monitor a finite horizon process. The performance measures of the proposed charts are derived using the Markov-chain approach. The proposed schemes can serve as a framework for quality engineers who wish to perform process monitoring easily and efficiently. Numerical comparisons between the proposed and existing Shewhart (SH) T2 charts have been made. The statistical performance measures were investigated in this article. The findings reveal that the proposed charts outperform the SH T2 chart for detecting small and moderate process shifts in a finite horizon process. The illustration of the run rules (RR) T2 chart is shown on a real manufacturing dataset in a finite horizon process. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","finite horizon process; Markov-chain; quality control; run rules; statistics","Control charts; Graphic methods; Process control; Process monitoring; Finite horizons; Flexible manufacturing; Markov chain approaches; Numerical comparison; Performance measure; Quality engineers; Quality improvement; Statistical performance measures; Markov chains","","","","","Kementerian Pengajian Tinggi Malaysia; School of Management, Universiti Sains Malaysia","information Kementerian Pengajian Tinggi Malaysia, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme, 203.PKOMP.6711797This work was funded by the Kementerian Pengajian Tinggi Malaysia, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (Grant Number 203.PKOMP.6711797).

However, very few studies have been done on charts to monitor downward process shifts, which is important since downward process shifts show process improvement. In view of the importance of today’s competitive manufacturing environment, this paper proposes a one-sided chart to monitor the downward multivariate CV (MCV) with variable sample size and sampling interval (VSSI), i.e. the VSSID MCV chart. This paper monitors the MCV as most industrial processes simultaneously monitor at least two or more quality characteristics, while the VSSI feature is incorporated, as it is shown that this feature brings about a significant improvement of the chart. A Markov chain approach was adopted for designing a performance measure of the proposed chart. The numerical comparison revealed that the proposed chart outperformed existing MCV charts. The implementation of the VSSID MCV chart is illustrated with an example. © 2020 Published by ITB Institute for Research and Community Services.","Average time to signal; Downward shifts; Expected average time to signal; Multivariate coefficient of variation; Variable sample size and sampling interval","","","","","","Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia; Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, HUSM","This work was funded by the Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [grant number 203.PMGT.6711755].

In recent years, the finite horizon process is commonly encountered in industries due to flexible manufacturing production. Past research works on finite horizon process monitoring are still limited. Because of this, one-sided 4-out-of-5 run rules charts are proposed to monitor the multivariate coefficient of variation in a finite horizon process. The performance measures of the proposed charts are derived using the Markov-chain approach. The proposed schemes can serve as a framework for practitioners who wish to perform process monitoring easily and efficiently. Numerical comparisons between the proposed and existing charts have been made, in terms of the truncated average run length and the expected truncated average run length criteria. The findings reveal that the proposed charts outperform the existing charts for detecting small and moderate process shifts in the finite horizon process. © 2021 World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

To detect crimes such as credit card fraud, several single and hybrid machine learning approaches have been used. However, these approaches have significant limitations as no further investigation on different hybrid algorithms for a given dataset were studied. This research proposes and investigates seven hybrid machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities with a real word dataset. The developed hybrid models consisted of two phases, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms were used first to detect credit card fraud, then, hybrid methods were constructed based on the best single algorithm from the first phase. Our findings indicated that the hybrid model Adaboost + LGBM is the champion model as it displayed the highest performance.

The optimal design parameters of the VP s chart are derived based on the economic and statistical criteria. The economic-statistical design is performed by minimizing the cost function with the imposed in-control and out-of-control statistical constraints. The cost of the economic-statistical design is slightly higher than the economic design due to the imposed statistical constraints. The effect of cost and process parameters on the optimal design parameters, statistical performance and minimum expected cost is examined and discussed. The comparison results indicate that the cost of the VP s chart is lower than the variable sample size and sampling interval (VSS) s chart, the variable sampling interval (VSI) s chart, the variable sample size (VSS) s chart and the standard s chart. © 2019 International Chinese Association of Quantitative Management.","Economic-statistical design;

Predicting stock market price trends is challenging because stock market data are non-linear and complex. Additionally, various factors, such as investor sentiment and news events, exert influence on stock price trends, leading to fluctuations in price trends. Researchers have implemented a variety of machine learning methods to predict stock price movements. The present study develops a hybrid deep learning network model consisting of a feature learning model, which is a long short-term memory model, and a feature selection model. Different types of data, including stock price, smoothing indicators, trend indicators, and oscillator indicators, are used as inputs to improve the model’s performance. Furthermore, to optimize the hyperparameter of each feature extraction model and feature selection model, a Genetic algorithm is utilized. An expert rule trend deterministic layer is also implemented to pre-process the data to further improve the model’s performance. The results indicate that the proposed model has superior testing performance compared to restricted Boltzmann machine, convolutional neural network, and autoencoder models. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

International oil companies consider various strategies in order to achieve superior performance. The procedure needs to overcome certain essential barriers for the adoption of the hybrid strategy that combines the cost leadership and differentiation strategy. The questionnaire was distributed online due to the COVID-19 pandemic that led to the closure of companies in the country. Out of the 537 questionnaires answered, 483 were used for further analysis which yielded usable response rate of 90%. The structural equation modeling results confirmed that the high costs of technologies, the priority of other external matters, inadequate industry regulation, insufficient supply, organizational capabilities, strategic capabilities, and financial capabilities are significantly related to strategic performance. The researchers recommend conducting an in-depth study of the phenomenon based on theoretical and empirical foundations, especially considering the relationship between the barriers of a hybrid strategy and strategic performance based on linear and non-compensatory relationships. This research sheds light on the barriers to adopting the hybrid strategy required by the oil sector as it relies on continuous production. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.","Barriers; Hybrid strategy; Oil industry; Strategic performance","","","","","","Institute of Postgraduate Studies, Universiti Sains Malaysia, IPS; Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315616); Pusat Pengajian Sains Matematik, Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work is funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia, Short-Term Grant [Grant Number: 304/PKOMP/6315616], for the Project entitled “New Coefficient of Variation Control Charts based on Variable Charting Statistics in Industry 4.0 for the Quality Smart Manufacturing and Services.” ","Abbas S., Al-Abrrow H., Abdullah H.O., Alnoor A., Khattak Z.Z., Khaw K.W., Encountering Covid-19 and perceived stress and the role of a health climate among medical workers, Current Psychology, 41, pp. 9109-9122, (2022); Abdulaali A.R., Alnoor A., Eneizan B., A multi-level study of influence financial knowledge management small and medium enterprises, Polish Journal of Management Studies, 19, (2019); Abdullah H., Thajil K., Alnoor A., Al-Abrrow H., Khaw K.W., Chew X.Y., Sadaa A., Predicting determinants of use mobile commerce through modeling non-linear relationships, Central European Business Review, (2022); Acquaah M., Yasai-Ardekani M., Does the implementation of a combination competitive strategy yield incremental performance benefits?

This study sheds light on the role of perceived risks in developing the relationship of each of the social bonds and the social network on the convenience of adopting wearable payment. The interactive role of barriers of using the wearable payment for the relationship convenience of adopting wearable payment and intention to use social commerce was also explored. Finally, this study highlighted the effect of the mediating variable of the convenience of adopting wearable payment. The survey was adopted by surveying 334 people with an online shopping experience. The results confirmed the role of interactive variables, perceived risk, and barriers of using wearable payment in increasing intention to use social commerce. On the other hand, the convenience of wearable payment adoption has fully mediated the relationship between social bonds, social network theories and intention to use social commerce. Implications for Central European audience: The findings of this study contribute to providing academics and practitioners with a deep insight into the antecedents of social commerce to develop practices and policies that increase intentions to use social commerce © 2022, entral European Business Review.

The literature confirms the issue of customer trust for social commerce businesses is a challenge that must be addressed. Hence, this study aims to examine the antecedents of trust in mobile social commerce by applying linear and non-linear relationships based on partial least squares structural equation modeling and artificial neural network model. Design/methodology/approach: This study applied a non-linear artificial neural network approach to provide a further understanding of the determinants of trust in mobile social commerce based on a non-linear and non-compensatory model. Besides, a questionnaire was distributed to 340 social commerce customers in Malaysia. Findings: The conceptual framework for investigating trust in mobile social commerce has various advantages and contributions to predicting consumer behavior. The results of the study showed there is a positive and significant relationship between social support, presence and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology2 (UTAUT2). In addition, UTAUT2 has fully mediated the relationship between social support, presence and trust in social commerce. Finally, the results concluded the relationship between UTAUT2 and trust in social commerce would be stronger when the diffusion of innovation and innovation resistance is high and low, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The current study provides a novel perspective on how customers can trust social m-commerce to provide real solutions to managers of encouraging e-marketing among consumers. Practical implications: This paper shows how businesses can develop trust in social m-commerce in Malaysian markets. The findings of this study probably could be extended to other businesses in Asia or other countries. Because trust in social e-commerce has a dynamic role in consumer behavior and intention to purchase. Originality/value: This study provided a new perspective on mobile social commerce and paid more attention to an investigation of such emerging commerce. The originality of this study is embodied by investigating an integrated model that included different theories that presented new directions of trust in mobile social commerce through social and behavioral determinants. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Diffusion of innovation theory; Innovation resistance theory; Social presence theory; Social support theory; Trust in m-social commerce; UTAUT2","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PMGT/6315513)","The aim of this study is to uncover the antecedents of trust in mobile social commerce adopting dual stages PLS-SEM and ANN model. Besides, this study strained to explore the solutions to reduce the negative impact of social by focusing on interest in adjusting customer behavior attitudes especially trust through social presence theory, social support theory, UTAUT2, diffusion innovation, innovation resistance. Moreover, customers can modify their behavior and complete their m-commerce purchases positively. This was highlighted by focusing on the Malaysian markets and how customers are responding to the social m-commerce experience. The results of this study indicated there are relationships between social support, present and trust in social m-commerce. In addition, the UTAUT2 has fully mediate the relationship between social support, present and trust in social m-commerce. On the other hand, the relationship between UTAUT2 and trust in social m-commerce was stronger when diffusion of innovation is high. However, the relationship between UTAUT2 and trust in social m-commerce was stronger when innovation resistance is law. This argument was supported by previous studies (; ; ; ; ).

The statistical performance of the SR MEWMA chart is evaluated in terms of the truncated run length properties when the shift in the process mean is known a priori. The optimal statistical design of the SR MEWMA chart is to find the optimal design parameters such as the smoothing parameter and the control limit through the minimization of the out-of-control truncated average run length. The study of the truncated run length performance of the SR MEWMA chart is also extended to the case when the shift in the process mean is unknown, by selecting a range of the process mean shifts that can be modeled by means of a uniform distribution. The numerical comparisons show that the SR MEWMA chart outperforms the variable sample size Hotelling’s T 2 chart, in terms of the truncated average run length and expectation of the truncated average run length criteria. An example is provided to illustrate the implementation of the SR MEWMA chart. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Markov chain; MEWMA chart; Short production runs; Truncated average run length; Truncated standard deviation of run length","Markov processes;

To this end, structural equation modelling (SEM) was adopted to test the causal relationships between the study variables. An exploratory design (i.e., a questionnaire) was used to collect data from 379 workers in energy companies in Iraq. The results of this study indicate that organizational contingencies affect financial performance. Besides, crisis management provides complete mediation of the relationship between organizational contingencies and financial performance. From the practitioner's point of view, leaders and practitioners should encourage a creative culture and idea generation to give members enough power to act and focus on goals that support building sustainable organizational capacity. Implications for Central European audience: The findings of this study contribute to providing academics and practitioners with a deep insight into the antecedents of financial performance to develop practices and policies that increase performance. © 2023, Central European Business Review.

The regression estimator that consists of information not only from the primary variable but also from the auxiliary variable is integrated into the control charting statistic. Optimal designs of the SSGR-AI chart, for the minimization of the expected cost function with and without statistical constraints, are developed based on (i) average run length (ARL) and (ii) expected average run length (EARL). Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are conducted, that is, the impact of various input parameters on the optimal parameters and costs for different values of correlation coefficients (ρ) between the primary and auxiliary variables are investigated. In addition, the effects of incorrect specification of the size of the shift on the optimal cost of the SSGR-AI chart are studied. The comparative study reveals that the SSGR-AI chart is superior to the exponentially weighted moving average-AI (EWMA-AI) and synthetic-AI (Syn-AI) charts, for both designs, by giving the smallest costs. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","average run length; economic and economic-statistical models; size of the shift is incorrectly specified; SSGR-AI chart","Cost benefit analysis; Cost functions; Sensitivity analysis; Auxiliary information; Average run lengths; Comparative studies; Correlation coefficient; Economic statistical design; Exponentially weighted moving average; Regression estimators; Statistical constraints; Control charts","","","","","","","Duncan A.J., The economic design of charts used to maintain current control of a process, J Am Stat Assoc, 51, 274, pp. 228-242, (1956); Woodall W.H., Weakness of the economic design of control charts, Technometrics, 28, 4, pp. 408-410, (1986); Saniga E.M., Economic statistical control-chart designs with an application to and R charts, Technometrics, 31, 3, pp. 313-320, (1989); Lorenzen T.J., Vance L.C., The economic design of control charts: a unified approach, Technometrics, 28, 1, pp. 3-10, (1986); Chung K.J.A., A simplified procedure for the economic design of control charts: a unified approach, Eng Optim, 17, 4, pp. 313-320, (1991); Yeong W.C., Khoo M.B.C., Wu Z., Castagliola P., Economically optimal design of a synthetic chart, Qual Reliab Eng Int, 28, 7, pp. 725-741, (2012); Lim S.L., Khoo M.B.C., Yeong W.C., Lee M.H., Economic and economic-statistical designs of the side sensitive group runs chart, Comput Ind Eng, 90, pp. 314-325, (2015); Gadre M.P., Rattihalli R.N., A side sensitive group runs control chart for detecting shifts in the process mean, Stat Methods Appl, 16, 1, pp. 27-37, (2007); Zhang C.W., Xie M., Goh T.N., Economic design of cumulative count of conforming charts under inspection by samples, Int J Prod Econ, 111, 1, pp. 93-104, (2008); Ng P.S., Khoo M.B.C., Saha S., Yeong W.C., Economic and economic-statistical designs of auxiliary information based synthetic and EWMA charts, Commun Stat Simul Comput, (2019); Riaz M., Monitoring process mean level using auxiliary information, Stat Neerl, 62, 4, pp. 458-481, (2008); Sanusi R.A., Abbas N., Riaz M., On efficient CUSUM-type location control charts using auxiliary information, Qual Technol Quant Manag, 15, 1, pp. 87-105, (2018); Abbas N., Riaz M., Does R.J.M.M., An EWMA-type control chart for monitoring the process mean using auxiliary information, Commun Stat-Theory Methods, 43, 16, pp. 3485-3498, (2014); Saha S., Khoo M.B.C., Umar A.A., Ng P.S., Side-sensitive group runs chart for detecting mean shifts using auxiliary information, AIP Conf Proceed, 2184, 1, (2019); Abbasi S.A., Riaz M., Ahmad S., Sanusi R.A., Abid M., New efficient exponentially weighted moving average variability charts based on auxiliary information, Qual Reliab Eng Int, 36, 7, pp. 2203-2224, (2020); Haq A., Abidin Z.U., An enhanced CUSUM-t chart for process mean, Qual Reliab Eng Int, 35, 7, pp. 2067-2080, (2019); Amir M.W., Raza Z., Abbas Z., Et al., On increasing the sensitivity of moving average control chart using auxiliary variable, Qual Reliab Eng Int, (2020); Ng P.S., Khoo M.B.C., Saha S., Teh S.Y., Run sum chart for the mean with auxiliary information, J Test Eval, 8, 2, pp. 1554-1575, (2020); Hussain S., Wang X., Ahmad S., Riaz M., On a class of mixed EWMA-CUSUM median control charts for process monitoring, Qual Reliab Eng Int, 36, 3, pp. 910-946, (2020)","M.B.C.

We study a two-sided Shewhart coefficient of variation chart with measurement errors for detecting both increase and decrease in the coefficient of variation for short run processes using an error model with linear covariate. The performance of the coefficient of variation chart is evaluated by the truncated average run length and the expected value of the truncated average run length. The numerical results indicate that the precision error and the accuracy error have negative effect of the measurement errors on the performance of the coefficient of variation chart. In addition, the constant coefficient B in the linear covariate error model reduces the negative effect of the measurement errors on the performance of the coefficient of variation chart. However, taking multiple measurements per item in each sample is not an effective method to enhance the performance of the coefficient of variation chart. An example is provided to illustrate the implementation of the coefficient of variation chart. In addition, the economic criterion is also added to study the effect of measurement errors on the expected inspection cost. The result shows that an increase in the precision error reduces the expected inspection cost. © 2013 IEEE.","Coefficient of variation; measurement errors; short production runs","Measurement errors; Average run lengths; Coefficient of variation; Constant coefficients; Economic criteria; Effect of measurements; Multiple measurements; Numerical results; Short production runs; Control charts","","","","","Sarawak Digital Economy Research; Sarawak Multimedia Authority","This work was supported by the Sarawak Multimedia Authority (SMA) through Sarawak Digital Economy Research Grant.","Kang C.W., Lee M.S., Seong Y.J., Hawkins D.M., A control chart for the coefficient of variation, J.

The quality management of manufacturing firms is introduced as a data mining application. For quality control and production management, quality factor analysis is crucial. Numerous studies have investigated the variable sampling interval (VSI) chart for the process average. Despite being significantly more widely used than the median chart, when faced with extremes or unforeseen data sets that cast doubt on the normality assumption, the mean (bar X ) chart is less resistant. The median chart, however, is more effective than the process average chart when outliers or extreme values are present in the process data being monitored. Since practitioners may believe that process shifts could have happened in the dataset because of the extreme values, incorrect inferences may be drawn. To solve this challenge, the variable sampling interval (VSI) median chart is proposed in this study. The VSI feature is used to enhance the performance of the median chart. The average time to signal (ATS) and expected average time to signal (EATS) criteria are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed charts. Based on the ATS and EATS criteria, the results show that the proposed VSI median chart outperforms the Shewhart (SH) median chart in detecting all sizes of shifts.  © 2022 IEEE.","average time to signal (ATS); expected average time to signal (EATS); median chart; SH median chart; Variable sampling interval (VSI)","Quality management; Statistical process control; Average time to signal; Expected average time to signal; Extreme value; Median chart; Shewhart; Shewhart median chart; Variable sampling interval; Variable sampling intervals; Data mining","","","","","","","Wan Q., Zhu M., Detecting a shift in variance using economically designed VSI control chart with combined attribute-variable inspection, Communications in Statistics-Simulation and Computation, 50, 11, pp. 3483-3497, (2021); Montgomery D.C., Introduction to Statistical Quality Control, (2005); Reynolds M.R., Amin R.W., Arnold J.C., Nachlas J.A., X charts with variable sampling intervals, Technometrics, 30, 2, pp. 181-192, (1988); Janacek G.J., Meikle S.E., Control charts based on medians, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series D (the Statistician), 46, 1, pp. 19-31, (1997); Castagliola P., An-EWMA control chart for monitoring the process sample median, International Journal of Reliability, Quality and Safety Engineering, 8, 2, pp. 123-135, (2001); Khoo M.B.C., A control chart based on sample median for the detection of a permanent shift in the process mean, Quality Engineering, 17, 2, pp. 243-257, (2005); Park H.I., Median control charts based on bootstrap method, Communications in Statistics-Simulation and Computation, 38, 3, pp. 558-570, (2009); Castagliola P., Figueiredo F.O., The median chart with estimated parameters, European Journal of Industrial Engineering, 7, 5, pp. 594-614, (2013); Ahmad S., Riaz M., Abbasi S.A., Lin Z., On median control charting under double sampling scheme, European Journal of Industrial Engineering, 8, 4, pp. 478-512, (2014); Castagliola P., Maravelakis P.E., Figueiredo F.O., The EWMA median chart with estimated parameters, IIE Transactions, 48, 1, pp. 66-74, (2016); Hu X., Castagliola P., Guaranteed conditional design of the median chart with estimated parameters, Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 33, 8, pp. 1873-1884, (2017); Teoh W.L., Khoo M.B., Teh S.Y., Chong Z.L., Moy W.H., You H.W., Another Look at the VSI EWMA X Chart When Estimating Process Parameters, (2022); Saha S., Khoo M.B.C., Ng P.S., Chong Z.L., Variable sampling interval run sum median charts with known and estimated process parameters, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 127, pp. 571-587, (2019); Khoo M.B.C., Saha S., Lee H.C., Castagliola P., Variable sampling interval exponentially weighted moving average median chart with estimated process parameters, Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 35, 8, pp. 2732-2748, (2019); Tran K.D., Nguyen H.D., Nguyen T.H., Tran K.P., Design of a variable sampling interval exponentially weighted moving average median control chart in presence of measurement errors, Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 37, 1, pp. 374-390, (2021); Xie F., Hu X., Qiao Y., Sun J., A variable sampling interval multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control chart for monitoring the Gumbel's bivariate exponential data, Scientia Iranica., (2022); Ng P.S., Khoo M.B.C., Saha S., Lee M.H., A variable sampling interval EWMA t chart with auxiliary information-A robustness study in the presence of estimation error, Alexandria Engineering Journal, 61, 8, pp. 6043-6059, (2022); Haq A., Sadia H., Khoo M.B.C., A parameter-free adaptive EWMA chart with variable sample sizes and variable sampling intervals for the process mean, Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, (2022); Zhang Y., Castagliola P., Wu Z., Khoo M.B.C., The variable sampling interval chart with estimated parameters, Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 28, 1, pp. 19-34, (2012); Saha S., Khoo M.B.C., Lee M.H., Haq A., A variable sample size and sampling interval control chart for monitoring the process mean using auxiliary information, Quality Technology & Quantitative Management, 16, 4, pp. 389-406, (2019)","S.

However, due to pro-technology bias, scholars focus more on adopting technology, and slightly less attention has been given to the impact of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) on customers’ intention to use social commerce. This study addresses the gap by examining the intention through exploring the effect of eWOM on males’ and females’ intentions and identifying the mediation of perceived crowding. To this end, we adopted a dual-stage multi-group structural equation modeling and artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) approach. We successfully extended the eWOM concept by integrating negative and positive factors and perceived crowding. The results reveal the causal and non-compensatory relationships between the constructs. The variables supported by the SEM analysis are adopted as the ANN model’s input neurons. According to the natural significance obtained from the ANN approach, males’ intentions to accept social commerce are related mainly to helping the company, followed by core functionalities. In contrast, females are highly influenced by technical aspects and mishandling. The ANN model predicts customers’ intentions to use social commerce with an accuracy of 97%. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of increasing customers’ intention toward social commerce channels among consumers based on our findings. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Commerce;

Methods/Statistical analysis: A Markov chain approach is used to compute the MRL and the probabilities of the run length distribution of the Syn MCV chart. The design procedure of the Syn MCV chart based on the MRL is presented to obtain the optimal design parameters by minimizing the out-of-control MRL at a specified shift. Findings: The plots of the probability of the run length distribution show that the skewness of the run length distribution for the Syn MCV chart decreases with the increase in the magnitude of shift. This indicates that when evaluating the performance of the Syn MCV chart, the MRL is a more meaningful criterion compared to the average run length (ARL). The comparison results reveal that the Syn MCV chart is superior against the standard MCV (Std MCV) chart in terms of the MRL. Application/Improvements: The synthetic scheme can be employed to improve the performance of the Std MCV chart based on the MRL. In addition, the numerical results show that the MRL is a better performance measure for the Syn MCV chart compared to the ARL. © 2020, Research Publication.

The PL approach allows the design of control schemes where practitioners can ensure the desired conditions on the in-control (IC) and out-of-control (OOC) run length (RL) performances satisfied with chosen probabilities. In other words, using the PL approach, we can guarantee the IC and OOC RL performances with desired probabilities. In addition, we examine the IC and OOC performances of the Shewhart median scheme based on the ARL, MRL, and PL approaches in detail. We conclude that the PL approach significantly improves the IC performance of the Shewhart median scheme compared to the ARL approach, without sacrificing much OOC performance when d = 1.5. Moreover, the MRL method can be treated as a particular case of the PL approach, i.e., the MRL is the 50th percentile of the RL distribution.  © 2022 ACM.","","Integrated circuit design; 50th percentiles; Average run lengths; Control performance; Control schemes; Desired conditions; In-control; Run length; Run length methods; Run-length performance; Shewhart; Integrated circuits","","","","","Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, UTAR, (FRGS/1/2019/STG06/UTAR/02/2)","This research is funded by the Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [grant number FRGS/1/2019/STG06/UTAR/02/2].","Mukherjee A., Rudra S., Optimal design of Shewhart-Lepage type schemes and its application in monitoring service quality, European Journal of Operational Research, 266, 1, pp. 147-167, (2018); Chong Z.L., Mukherjee A., Khoo C.M.B., Some simplified Shewhart-type distribution-free joint monitoring schemes and its application in monitoring drinking water turbidity, Quality Engineering, 32, 1, pp. 91-110, (2020); Mukherjee A., Chong Z.L., Khoo C.M.B., Comparisons of some distribution-free CUSUM and EWMA schemes and their applications in monitoring impurity in mining process flotation, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 137, (2019); Wang J., Chong Z.L., Qiu P., Optimal monitoring of Poisson data with known and unknown shifts, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 154, 8, (2021); Chan K.M., Mukherjee A., Chong Z.L., Lee H.C., Distribution-free double exponentially and homogeneously weighted moving average Lepage schemes with an application in monitoring exit rate, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 161, 5, (2021); Janacek G.J., Meikle S.E., Control charts based on medians, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series D (The Statistician), 46, 1, pp. 19-31, (1997); Khoo M.B.C., A control chart based on sample median for the detection of a permanent shift in the process mean, Quality engineering, 17, 2, pp. 243-257, (2005); Castagliola P., Figueiredo F.O., The median chart with estimated parameters, European Journal of Industrial Engineering, 7, 5, pp. 594-614, (2013); Khoo C.M.B., Wong V.H., Wu Z., Castagliola P., Optimal design of the synthetic chart for the process mean based on median run length, IIE Transactions, 44, 9, pp. 765-779, (2012); Teoh W.L., Khoo C.M.B., Castagliola P., Chakraborti S., Optimal design of the double sampling X chart with estimated parameters based on median run length, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 67, pp. 104-115, (2014); Teoh W.L., Chong J.K., Khoo C.M.B., Castagliola P., Yeong W.C., Optimal designs of the variable sample size chart based on median run length and expected median run length, Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 33, 1, pp. 121-134, (2017); Tang A., Castagliola P., Sun J., Hu X., Optimal design of the adaptive EWMA chart for the mean based on median run length and expected median run length, Quality Technology & Quantitative Management, 16, 4, pp. 439-458, (2019); Chong Z.L., Tan K.L., Khoo C.M.B., Teoh W.L., Castagliola P., Optimal designs of the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) median chart for known and estimated parameters based on median run length, Communications in Statistics-Simulation and Computation, (2020); Faraz A., Saniga E., Montgomery D., Percentile-based control chart design with an application to Shewhart X and S2 control charts, Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 35, 1, pp. 116-126, (2019); Montgomery D.C., Statistical quality control: A modern introduction, (2013); Castagliola P., Maravelakis P.E., Figueiredo F.O., The EWMA median chart with estimated parameters, IIE Transactions, 48, 1, pp. 66-74, (2016)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","11th International Conference on Software and Computer Applications, ICSCA 2022","24 February 2022 through 26 February 2022","Virtual, Online","179912","","978-145038577-0","","","English","ACM Int.

Methods/Statistical analysis: The economic design of the DS X chart with measurement errors is investigated by using the linear covariate error model. The optimal design parameters of the DS X chart are determined through the minimization of the cost function. The effect of the measurement errors is evaluated based on the numerical example over a wide range of the parameters of the measurement errors, where the parameters of the measurement errors are the coefficient B and the measurement error ratio. Findings: The numerical results show that an increase in the value of the coefficient B or a decrease in the value of the measurement error ratio in the linear covariate error model leads to the lower false alarm rate and cost with more frequent sampling interval and smaller number of multiple measurements per item. It can be noticed that the sample sizes at the first and second stages of the DS scheme as well as the out-of-control statistical performance of the DS X chart are robust to the measurement errors. In addition, the warning and control limits of the DS X chart are also not affected by the measurement errors. Application/Improvements: An example is provided to illustrate the implementation of the economic design of the DS X chart with measurement errors. © Research India Publications","<sub>X</sub> chart; Cost function; Double sampling; Linear covariate error model; Measurement errors","","","","","","Sarawak Digital Economy Research; Sarawak Multimedia Authority","The authors would like to acknowledge the Sarawak Multimedia Authority (SMA) in financing this research through Sarawak Digital Economy Research Grant.","Shewhart W.

The effect of process parameter estimation on the expected cost of the synthetic np chart is investigated with the imposed statistical constraints. The minimum number of preliminary subgroups is determined where an almost similar expected cost to the known process parameter case is desired for the given cost model parameters. However, the available number of preliminary subgroups in practice is usually limited, especially when the number of preliminary subgroups is large. Consequently, the optimal chart parameters of the synthetic np chart are computed by considering the practical number of preliminary subgroups in which the cost function is minimized. This leads to a lower expected cost compared to that of adopting the optimal chart parameter corresponding to the known process parameter case. © 2020 Lee et al.

In certain areas, such as in finance and healthcare, the process mean and variance are not independent of one another. Hence, adopting traditional control charts monitoring the process mean and variance are dubious. In such situations, the coefficient of variation (CV), which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean should be monitored instead. In real situations, there are many processes monitoring at least two or more quality variables simultaneously. In these processes, the use of univariate control charts will cause erroneous conclusions. This paper proposes a synthetic chart (Syn MCV) to monitor the multivariate CV. Formulae and algorithms to optimize the various performance measures are explained. The proposed chart is numerically compared with its counterparts, in terms of average run length (ARL), standard deviation of the run length (SDRL) and expected average run length (EARL) criteria. The results indicate that the proposed chart has the best performance among its counterparts for all or certain ranges of shifts in the multivariate CV. The application of the proposed Syn MCV chart is illustrated using real dataset from a manufacturing process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Average run length; Control chart; Expected average run length; Multivariate coefficient of variation; Synthetic","monitoring; review","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315170)","This work was supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia , Short Term Grants [ 304/PKOMP/6315170 ].

Such a method is considered an innovative way for the financial wallet but with some encumbrances. Trust in mobile commerce is one of the challenges yet to receive in-depth studies regarding linear and non-compensatory relationships. This study aims to evaluate the determinants of trust in mobile commerce using hybrid three-stage Fuzzy Delphi-Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. A hybrid approach was performed on 344 users mobile-commerce activities. The results of this study provide valuable insights for mobile commerce firms to come up with effective plans that increase customer trust in mobile commerce. Practically, the relative importance of specific determinants of trust in mobile commerce contributes to providing deep insight into the factors of customer trust in mobile commerce. The proposed model predicts 94.80% trust in mobile commerce with social presence and social support theories. A novel perspective was provided in this study to encourage e-marketing among consumers to persuade customers to trust mobile commerce. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Sales; Artificial neural network approach; Customer trust; Fuzzy Delphi; Hybrid approach; In-depth study; M-commerce; Model networks; Neural-networks; Social presence; Structural equation models; Mobile commerce","","","","","Machine Learning Techniques To Support Industry; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8011136)","This work is supported by the RUI (Individual) Grant by the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) under Grant No. 1001/PKOMP/8011136 for the project entitled “A New Adaptive Kernel-Distance-Based Control Chart by Machine Learning Techniques To Support Industry 4.0 Sustainable Smart Manufacturing”.","Abbas S., Hadi A.A., Abdullah H.O., Alnoor A., Khattak Z.Z., Khaw K.W., Encountering Covid-19 and perceived stress and the role of a health climate among medical workers, Current Psychology, pp. 1-14, (2021); Abdulaali A.R., Alnoor A., Eneizan B., A multi-level study of influence financial knowledge management small and medium enterprises, Polish Journal of Management Studies, 19, 1, pp. 21-31, (2019); Abdullah H., Ismail I., Alnoor A., Yaqoub E., Effect of perceived support on employee’s voice behaviour through the work engagement: A moderator role of locus of control, International Journal of Process Management and Benchmarking, 11, 1, pp. 60-79, (2021); Al-Abrrow H., Alnoor A., Abbas S., The effect of organizational resilience and CEO’s narcissism on project success: Organizational risk as mediating variable, Organization Management Journal, 16, 1, pp. 1-13, (2019); Understanding employees’ responses to the COVID‐19 pandemic: The attractiveness of healthcare jobs, Global Business and Organizational Excellence, 40, 2, pp. 19-33, (2021); Albahri A.S., Alnoor A., Zaidan A.A., Albahri O.S., Hameed H., Zaidan B.B., Yass A.A., Hybrid artificial neural network and structural equation modelling techniques: A survey, Complex & Intelligent Systems, pp. 1-21, (2021); Alhamdi M., Alnoor A., Eneizan B., Abdulla M., Abdulaali A.R., Determinants of the production system time (Jit) on reduce waste: Case study in a salsal water company, International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences, 9, 7, pp. 17-32, (2019); Alnoor A.M., Al-Abrrow H., Abdullah H., Abbas S., The impact of self‐efficacy on employees’ ability to accept new technology in an Iraqi university, Global Business and Organizational Excellence, 39, 2, pp. 41-50, (2020); Alnoor A., Human capital dimensions and firm performance, mediating role of knowledge management, International Journal of Business Excellence, 20, 2, pp. 149-168, (2020); Antioco M., Kleijnen M., Consumer adoption of technological innovations: Effects of psychological and functional barriers in a lack of content versus a presence of content situation, European Journal of Marketing, 44, 11-12, pp. 1700-1724, (2010); Aransyah M.F., Roy J., Aprianti Y., Innovation resistance and perceive novelty on e-wallet services, Mulawarman International Conference on Economics and Business, 2, 1, pp. 115-122, (2020); Arif I., Afshan S., Sharif A., Resistance to mobile banking adoption in a developing country: Evidence from modified TAM, Journal of Finance and Economics Research, 1, 1, pp. 25-42, (2016); Arora N.K., Finney Rutten L.J., Gustafson D.H., Moser R., Hawkins R.P., Perceived helpfulness and impact of social support provided by family, friends, and health care providers to women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, Psycho‐Oncology, 16, 5, pp. 474-486, (2007); Attar R.W., Shanmugam M., Hajli N., Investigating the antecedents of e-commerce satisfaction in social commerce context, British Food Journal, 123, 3, pp. 849-868, (2021); Ballantine P.W., Stephenson R.J., Help me, I’m fat!

One of the common charts that are used to monitor process variability is the S control chart. Finite horizon process monitoring has received great attention in the last decade. In the current literature, no attempt has been made to monitor the process variability in a finite horizon process. To fill this gap in research, this paper proposes two one-sided modified S charts for monitoring the standard deviation in a finite horizon process. The performance of the proposed charts is evaluated in terms of the truncated average run length and truncated standard deviation of the run-length criteria. The numerical performances of the proposed charts are shown with the selection of numerous process shifts. The effect of the sample sizes, the number of inspections and the process shifts are studied. © 2021 Gnedenko Forum.","Control charting technique; Finite horizon process; Process variability; Statistical quality control; Truncated average run length","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","This work was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [Grant Number 203.PMGT.6711755], for the Project entitled “A New Hybrid Model for Monitoring the Multivariate Coefficient of Variation in Healthcare Surveillance”.","Noorian S., Ahmadabadi M.

Control charting techniques have gained increasing importance recently due to the rapid advancement in technology. Many industries tend to use control charts to monitor the quality of their products or services. The adoption of variable sample size and sampling interval (VSSI) strategy significantly improved the sensitivity of Shewhart X chart in detecting small and moderate process mean shifts, in terms of average time to signal (ATS) criterion when the process shifts are specified. However, for some scenarios in real industries, the process shift size is not set to a specific value. In this case, the expected average time to signal (EATS) can be used as a measure of performance when the process shift is unknown. The EATS of the optimal VSSI X chart is numerically evaluated based on a Markov chain approach. The findings show that the VSSI X chart prevails over the Shewhart X chart under comparison. Being able to vary the sample size and sampling interval, a practitioner will have more flexibility and better control of the process and at the same time is able to detect an out-of-control signal quicker. © 2019 International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology.","Expected average time to signal;

The coefficient of variation (CV) is a common measure of dispersion in many real-life applications. Recently, CV control charts are proposed to monitor processes which do not have a constant mean and a standard deviation which changes with the mean. These processes cannot be monitored by standard control charts which monitor the mean and/or standard deviation. This research proposes the monitoring of the multivariate coefficient of variation (MCV) by means of run rules (RR MCV) control charts, which is not available in the existing literature. The design of these charts is obtained using a Markov-chain approach. The proposed charts are simple to implement. The performance of the RR MCV and Shewhart MCV (SH MCV) charts are compared in terms of the average run length (ARL) and the expected average run length (EARL). An example is illustrated based on a real dataset. The findings revealed that the performance of the proposed charts surpasses the SH MCV chart for detecting small and moderate MCV shifts. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Average run length; expected average run length; Markov-chain; multivariate coefficient of variation; run rules","","","","","","Fundamental Research Grant Scheme, Malaysia, (FP080-2018A); Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6315170)","This work was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia, Short Term Grants [grant number 304/PKOMP/6315170]; Fundamental Research Grant Scheme, Malaysia [grant number FP080-2018A].

However, research shows most people do not consume an adequate intake of vegetables per day. An ameliorate dietary assessment for vegetable intake is needed to increase awareness and assist users to improve their vegetable consumption. In this paper, we proposed a novel Quantized Deep Residual Convolutional Neural Network (DRCNN) model to ameliorate the fundamental task of dietary assessment. The proposed deep learning strategy integrating a deep residual architecture and a deep learning model, i.e. convolutional neural network, to apply for image-based dietary assessment. The proposed DRCNN model is then deeply fused with post-training quantization techniques to quantize the network weights of the proposed DRCNN model into low-bit fixed-point representations. Extensive experiments have been done to evaluate the proposed model. Results show that the proposed Quantized DRCNN model outperformed the state-of-the-arts, which include the conventional CNN models and also the machine learning models. Those experiments also indicate the effectiveness of the proposed Quantized DRCNN model. Finally, we further evaluate our model with cross-dataset validation to verify the generalization of the proposed model. The experimental result proves that the proposed Quantized DRCNN model is general enough to predict unseen cases and it works well on a wide range of food images. © 2013 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network; deep learning; deep residual network; image-based dietary assessment; machine learning; quantized model","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Vegetables; Dietary assessments; Essential elements; Fixed points; Learning models; Learning strategy; Machine learning models; Network weights; State of the art; Learning systems","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (203/PKOMP/6711797)","This work was supported in part by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) by the Malaysian Ministry of Education for the Project entitled New Robust Adaptive Model for the Coefficient of Variation in Infinite and Finite Horizon Processes under Grant 203/PKOMP/6711797.","Fayet-Moore F., Mcconnell A., Cassettari T., Tuck K., Petocz P., Kim J., Vegetable intake in Australian children and adolescents: The importance of consumption frequency, eating occasion and its association with dietary and sociodemographic factors, Public Health Nutr., 23, 3, pp. 474-487, (2020); Teschl C., Nossler C., Schneider M., Carlsohn A., Luhrmann P., Vegetable consumption among University students: Relationship between vegetable intake, knowledge of recommended vegetable servings and selfassessed achievement of vegetable intake recommendations, Health Edu.

However, due to pro-technology bias, scholars focus on technology adoption and slightly attention has been paid to the impact of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) on customers’ intention to use new online channels. This chapter addresses this gap by examining this intention through exploring the effect of eWOM on customers’ intention. In addition, this chapter will address the role of the positive and negative factors of eWOM such as affective, mishandling, and esthetics factors in social commerce. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.","e-commerce; Electronic word of mouth; Social commerce; Web 2.0 technologies","","","","","","","","Ahmad S.N., Laroche M., Analyzing electronic word of mouth: A social commerce construct, Int J Inf Manage, 37, 3, pp. 202-213, (2017); Alhulail H., Dick M., Abareshi A., The influence of word of mouth on customer loyalty to social commerce websites: Trust as a mediator, International conference of reliable information and communication technology, pp. 1025-1033, (2018); Ali Y.S., Hussin A.R.C., Dahlan H.M., Electronic word of mouth engagement in social commerce platforms: An empirical study, Inf Dev, 36, 3, pp. 438-456, (2020); Allsop D.T., Bassett B.R., Hoskins J.A., Word-of-mouth research: Principles and applications, J Advert Res, 47, 4, pp. 398-403, (2007); Anderson R.E., Srinivasan S.S., E-satisfaction and e-loyalty: A contingency framework, Psychol Mark, 20, 2, pp. 123-138, (2003); Bhowmick A.K., Mitra B., Listen to me, my neighbors or my friend?

Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted in several service companies, and the study adopted the questionnaire as a basic tool for the data collection on the practical side, as 267 opinions were surveyed, in addition to conducting personal interviews, and the normal distribution of data was tested, analyzing, describing and diagnosing study variables, testing correlations and determining direct effects. Findings: Findings show that there is no direct and significant statistical impact of information technology on organizational communications. Whereas there was a positive, direct and statistically significant impact of information technology on the organizational structure. There was also a positive, direct and statistically significant effect of the organizational structure on organizational communication. Research limitations/implications: This paper is restricted to the role of the organizational structure as a mediating variable of the relationship between the influence of information technology on organizational communication. Practical implications: As part of the practical implication, the paper suggests the need to increase support and attention to the importance of information technology in service organizations in order to increase coordination and organizational communication and achieve a high ability to explore and exploit ideas. Originality/value: Apart from the fact that several companies were engaged, the organizational structures of these companies were engaged too to examine the impacts of Information technology (ICT) on organizational communication. © 2023, XinYing Chew, Raed Alharbi, Khai Wah Khaw and Alhamzah Alnoor.","Information technology;

The fact that almost all industrial process monitoring involves a minimum of two or more related quality characteristics being monitored simultaneously. The existing adaptive charts for monitoring the multivariate CV are focused on detecting upward process shifts. The downward process monitoring is crucial since it shows process improvement. Very little research works are available on the downward adaptive multivariate CV chart. This makes it difficult for the quality engineer who wishes to implement the adaptive multivariate CV chart on the downward process monitoring. Therefore, this paper filled the research gap by proposing a downward variable parameter chart for the multivariate coefficient of variation. The performance measures of the proposed charts are derived based on the Markov-chain approach. Numerical comparisons between the proposed and existing charts have been made, in terms of the average time to signal criterion. The findings reveal that the proposed charts outperform the existing charts for detecting small and moderate downward process shifts. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

A number of studies have been conducted to enquire the causes of environmental pollution which suggested numerous policies and techniques as remedial measures. One such major source of environmental pollution, as reported by previous studies, has been the garbage resulting from disposed hospital wastes. The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted into mass generation of medical waste which seems to have further deteriorated the issue of environmental pollution. This necessitates active attention from both the researchers and policymakers for effective management of medical waste to prevent the harm to environment and human health. The issue of medical waste management is more important for countries lacking sophisticated medical infrastructure. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to propose a novel application for identification and classification of 10 hospitals in Iraq which generated more medical waste during the COVID-19 pandemic than others in order to address the issue more effectively. We used the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method to this end. We integrated MCDM with other techniques including the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), linear Diophantine fuzzy set decision by opinion score method (LDFN-FDOSM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) analysis to generate more robust results. We classified medical waste into five categories, i.e., general waste, sharp waste, pharmaceutical waste, infectious waste, and pathological waste. We consulted 313 experts to help in identifying the best and the worst medical waste management technique within the perspectives of circular economy using the neural network approach. The findings revealed that incineration technique, microwave technique, pyrolysis technique, autoclave chemical technique, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, dry heat, ozone, and ultraviolet light were the most effective methods to dispose of medical waste during the pandemic. Additionally, ozone was identified as the most suitable technique among all to serve the purpose of circular economy of medical waste. We conclude by discussing the practical implications to guide governments and policy makers to benefit from the circular economy of medical waste to turn pollutant hospitals into sustainable ones. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Circular economy; COVID-19; Environmental pollution; Medical/healthcare waste; Multi-Criteria Decision Making","COVID-19; Humans; Incineration; Medical Waste; Pandemics; Waste Management; coronavirus disease 2019; hospital waste; human; incineration; pandemic; waste management","","Medical Waste, ","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2022/STG06/USM/02/4)","This work is funded by Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia, Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [Grant Number: FRGS/1/2022/STG06/USM/02/4], for the Project entitled “Efficient Joint Process Monitoring using a New Robust Variable Sample Size and Sampling Interval Run Sum Scheme”.

Recently, the MGR scheme was studied using the average number of observations to signal (ANOS) criterion, under the scenario where the process parameters are unknown (Case-U). However, a setback of this study is that the exact shift size must be specified prior to the implementation of this scheme as this is required by the ANOS criterion. In most of the scenarios, practitioners do not have a good knowledge of the exact shift size. To tackle this issue, we propose the use of the expected average number of observations to signal (EANOS) criterion in evaluating the performance of the Case-U MGR scheme. We also proposed the optimal design of the MGR scheme with Case-U based on minimizing out-of-control (OOC) EANOS. Finally, we present an example of application and demonstrate that the proposed procedure eases the implementation of the MGR scheme with Case-U as it minimizes the risk of misspecifying the shift size. © 2019 IEEE.","Estimated process parameters; expected average number of samples; modified group runs scheme; optimal design; shift size","Optimal systems; Average numbers; modified group runs scheme; Optimal design; Process parameters; shift size; Parameter estimation","","","","","UTAR Research Fund, (IPSR/RMC/UTARRF/2018-C2/C04)","This research is supported by the UTAR Research Fund (UTARRF), no.

Despite numerous efforts to promote the awareness of healthy food consumption, the obesity rate has been increased in the past few years. An automated food recognition system is needed to serve as a fundamental source of information for promoting a balanced diet and assisting users to understand their meal consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel Lightweight Neural Architecture Search (LNAS) model to self-generate a thin Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can be executed on mobile devices with limited processing power. LNAS has a sophisticated search space and modern search strategy to design a child model with reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the model generated by LNAS, namely LNAS-NET. The experimental result shows that the proposed LNAS-NET outperformed the state-of-the-art lightweight models in terms of training speed and accuracy metric. Those experiments indicate the effectiveness of LNAS without sacrificing the model performance. It provides a good direction to move toward the era of AutoML and mobile-friendly neural model design. © 2021 by the authors.

Control charts are one of the important tools to monitor quality. Recently, control charts monitoring the coefficient of variation (CV) are proposed to monitor processes which do not have a constant mean and a standard deviation which changes with the mean. These processes cannot be monitored by standard control charts which monitor the mean and/or standard deviation. The Variable Sampling Interval (VSI) and Variable Sample Size (VSS) CV charts are two recent charts proposed to improve the detection ability of CV charts. This paper compares the performance between these two charts in terms of the Average Time to Signal (ATS). The comparison shows that the VSS CV chart shows better performance when either a small sample size is taken or when a small shift in the CV needs to be detected. Alternatively, the VSI CV chart outperforms the VSS CV chart. This paper will enable practitioners to know the conditions where the VSS CV chart outperforms the VSI CV chart, and vice versa. Hence, practitioners will be able to decide whether it is better to monitor their processes with a VSI or VSS scheme. © 2019, Avestia Publishing.","Average time to signal; Coefficient of variation; Sample size; Shift size; Variable sample size; Variable sampling interval","","","","","","","","Castagliola P., Celano G., Psarakis S., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using EWMA charts, Journal of Quality Technology, 43, 3, pp. 249-265, (2011); Apple F.S., Murakami M.M., Pearce L.A., Herzog C.A., Predictive value of cardiac troponin I and T for subsequent death in end-stage renal disease, Circulation, 106, 23, pp. 2941-2945, (2002); Chadban S.J., Briganti E.M., Kerr P.G., Dunstan D.W., Welborn T.A., Zimmet P.Z., Atkins R.C., Prevalence of kidney damage in Australian adults: The AusDiab kidney study, Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, 14, pp. S131-S138, (2003); Tian L., Inferences on the common coefficient of variation, Statistics in Medicine, 24, 14, pp. 2213-2220, (2005); Schwartz L.H., Ginsberg M.S., DeCorato D., Rothenberg L.N., Einstein S., Kijewski P., Panicek D.M., Evaluation of tumor measurements in oncology: Use of film-based and electronic techniques, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 18, 10, pp. 2179-2184, (2000); Hamer A.J., Strachan J.R., Black M.M., Ibbotson C., Elson R.A., A new method of comparative bone strength measurement, Journal of Medical Engineering & Technology, 19, 1, pp. 1-5, (1995); Reed G.F., Lynn F., Meade B.D., Use of coefficient of variation in assessing variability of quantitative assays, Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology, 9, 6, pp. 1235-1239, (2002); Seyler C., Hofstetter T.B., Hungerbuhler K., Life cycle inventory for thermal treatment of waste solvent from chemical industry: A multi-input allocation model, Journal of Cleaner Production, 13, 13, pp. 1211-1224, (2005); Curto J.D., Pinto J.C., The coefficient of variation asymptotic distribution in the case of non-iid random variables, Journal of Applied Statistics, 36, 1, pp. 21-32, (2009); Pang W.K., Yu B.W., Troutt M.D., Shui H.H., A simulation-based approach to the study of coefficient of variation of dividend yields, European Journal of Operational Research, 189, 2, pp. 559-569, (2008); Kang C.W., Lee M.S., Seong Y.J., Hawkins D.M., A control chart for the coefficient of variation, Journal of Quality Technology, 39, 2, pp. 151-158, (2007); Hong E.P., Kang C.W., Baek J.W., Kang H.W., Development of CV control chart using EWMA technique, Journal of Society of Korea Industrial and Systems Engineering, 31, 4, pp. 114-120, (2008); Zhang J., Li Z., Chen B., Wang Z., A new exponentially weighted moving average control chart for monitoring the coefficient of variation, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 78, pp. 205-212, (2014); Calzada M.E., Scariano S.M., A synthetic control chart for the coefficient of variation, Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, 83, 5, pp. 853-867, (2013); Castagliola P., Achouri A., Taleb H., Celano G., Psarakis S., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using control charts with run rules, Quality Technology & Quantitative Management, 10, 1, pp. 75-94, (2013); You H.W., Khoo M.B.C., Castagliola P., Haq A., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using the side sensitive group runs chart, Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 32, 5, pp. 1913-1927, (2016); Teoh W.L., Khoo M.B.C., Castagliola P., Yeong W.C., Teh S.Y., A run sum control chart for monitoring the coefficient of variation, European Journal of Operational Research, 257, 1, pp. 144-158, (2017); Castagliola P., Achouri A., Taleb H., Celano G., Psarakis S., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using a variable sampling interval control chart, Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 29, 8, pp. 1135-1149, (2013); Reh W., Scheffler B., Significance tests and confidence intervals for coefficients of variation, Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, 22, 4, pp. 449-452, (1996); Castagliola P., Achouri A., Taleb H., Celano G., Psarakis S., Monitoring the coefficient of variation using a variable sample size control chart, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 80, 9-12, pp. 1561-1576, (2015); Yeong W.C., Khoo M.B.C., Lim S.L., Lee M.H., A direct procedure for monitoring the coefficient of variation using a variable sample size scheme, Communications in Statistics-Simulation and Computation, 46, 6, pp. 4210-4225, (2017)","","","Avestia Publishing","","4th World Congress on Mechanical, Chemical, and Material Engineering, MCM 2018","16 August 2018 through 18 August 2018","Madrid","141688","23698136","","","","English","Proc.

Previous studies revealed that the coefficient of variation (CV) is important in ensuring process quality, especially for monitoring a process where its process mean and variance are highly correlated. The fact that almost all industrial process monitoring involves a minimum of two or more related quality characteristics being monitored simultaneously, this paper incorporates the salient feature of the adaptive sample size VSS scheme into the standard multivariate CV (MCV) chart, called the VSS MCV chart. A Markov chain model is developed for the derivation of the charts performance measures, i.e the average run length (ARL), the standard deviation of the run length (SDRL), the average sample size (ASS), the average number of observations to signal (ANOS) and the expected average run length (EARL). The numerical comparison shows that the proposed chart prevails over the existing standard MCV chart for detecting small and moderate upward and downward MCV shifts. © 2021 International Academic Press.

The control charting technique is one of the most effective techniques to monitor process quality. In certain processes where the process mean and variance are not independent of one another, the coefficient of variation (CV), which measures the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean should be monitored. Castagliola et al. [21] proposed the two-sided run rules (RR) control charts for monitoring the CV and it is found that the RR CV charts revealed the problem of ARL-biased performances, especially when the monitored sample size is small, for detecting downward CV shifts. This paper alters the RR CV chart by suggesting the two one-sided run rules (ORR) CV charts achieve the unbiased ARL performances. Additionally, this paper also investigates the ORR CV charts in terms of the expected average run length (EARL) criterion, which is not discussed in [21]. A Markov chain model is established for designing the proposed charts. The statistical performances of the ORR CV, RR CV and Shewhart CV (SH CV) charts are compared in terms of the average run length (ARL) and EARL criteria. The results show that the proposed charts surpass the RR CV and SH CV charts for detecting small and moderate upward and downward CV shifts. The implementation of the ORR CV charts is illustrated with an example using a real dataset. © 2019 International Academic Press.","Average run length; Coefficient of variation; Expected average run length;

More recently, research works focused on the use of variable sampling intervals (VSIs), where the lengths of the sampling intervals are varied according to the process quality. A short sampling interval is considered when the process quality indicates a possible out-of-control situation while a long sampling interval is considered, otherwise. In this paper, the VSI run sum (RS) Xchart is proposed with its optimal scores and parameters determined using an optimization technique to minimize the out-of-control average time to signal (ATS) or the adjusted average time to signal (AATS). A Markov-chain method is used to evaluate both the ATS and AATS of the proposed chart, for the zero and steady state cases, respectively. Results show that the VSI RS Xchart is considerably more efficient than the basic RS Xchart. The VSI RS Xchart performs generally well compared with other competing charts, such as the standard X, synthetic X, exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) X, VSI Xand VSI EWMA Xcharts. The sensitivity of the VSI RS Xchart can be enhanced further by adding more scoring regions or a head-start feature. An illustrative example is presented to explain the implementation of the proposed VSI RS Xchart. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Adjusted average time to signal; Average time to signal; Control charts; Markov chain; VSI run sum X chart","Chains; Control charts; Flowcharting; Markov processes; Process monitoring; Quality control; Statistical process control; Adjusted average time to signals; Average time to signal; Exponentially weighted moving average; Markov chain method; Optimization techniques; Sampling interval; Variable sampling intervals; X-charts; Process control","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PMATHS/811263)","This research is supported by the MyBrain15 (MyPhD) Scholarship Program under the Research University, Grant no.

The control charting technique is one of the most effective techniques to monitor process quality. In certain processes where the process mean and variance are not independent of one another, the coefficient of variation (CV), which measures the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, should be monitored. In line with industrial settings, where at least two or more variables are monitored simultaneously in most processes, this paper proposes a variable parameter (VP) chart to monitor the multivariate CV (MCV). Formulae and algorithms to optimize the various performance measures are discussed. The proposed VP MCV chart is designed based on a Markov chain approach. The performance comparison shows that the proposed VP MCV chart prevails over the existing MCV charts, in terms of the average time to signal (ATS), standard deviation of the time of signal (SDTS), and expected average time to signal (EATS) criteria. An example is presented to illustrate the implementation of the proposed VP MCV chart. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","average time to signal; expected average time to signal; Markov chain; multivariate coefficient of variation;

This study collects empirical data from 427 employees belonging to Malaysian family firms via a structured questionnaire. Results demonstrate supportive, authentic, and paternalistic leadership styles affect the sustainability commitment strategy of organizations. Moreover, employees' eco-friendly best practices fully mediate the link between leadership styles and the organizational strategy of sustainability commitment. Findings of non-compensatory relationships also indicated employees' eco-friendly best practices is the most determinant of the strategy of sustainability commitment, followed by authentic leadership, supportive leadership, and paternalistic leadership. © 2023","ANFIS; employees' eco-friendly best practices; Leadership styles; Strategy of sustainability commitment","Environmental protection; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Personnel; And neuro-fuzzy inference system; Best practices; Commitment strategy; Eco-friendly; Employee' eco-friendly best practice; Family firms; Leadership style; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Strategy of sustainability commitment; Structural equation models; Sustainable development","","","","","","","Abdul-Rashid S.H., Sakundarini N., Ghazilla R.A.R., Thurasamy R., The impact of sustainable manufacturing practices on sustainability performance: Empirical evidence from Malaysia, International Journal of Operations & Production, 1, 2, pp. 206-223, (2017); Agostino M., Ruberto S., Environment-friendly practices: Family versus non-family firms, Journal of Cleaner Production, 329, (2021); Ahuja G., Katila R., Technological acquisitions and the innovation performance of acquiring firms: A longitudinal study, Strategic Management Journal, 22, 3, pp. 197-220, (2001); Akadiri P.O., Fadiya O.O., Empirical analysis of the determinants of environmentally sustainable practices in the UK construction industry, Construction, 1, 3, pp. 20-35, (2013); Albahri A.S., Alnoor A., Zaidan A.A., Albahri O.S., Hameed H., Zaidan B.B., Yass A.A., Hybrid artificial neural network and structural equation modelling techniques: A survey, Complex & Intelligent Systems, 8, 2, pp. 1781-1801, (2022); Al-Emran M., Abbasi G.A., Mezhuyev V., Evaluating the impact of knowledge management factors on M-learning adoption: A deep learning-based hybrid SEM-ANN approach, Recent advances in technology acceptance models and theories, pp. 159-172, (2021); Alnoor A., Tiberius V., Atiyah A.G., Khaw K.W., Yin T.S., Chew X., Abbas S., How positive and negative electronic word of mouth (eWOM) affects customers’ intention to use social commerce?

The short runs process is commonly seen in production after the industry moved toward flexible manufacturing. Monitoring the coefficient of variation (CV) is useful in a wide variety of scientific areas. In a view of the importance in monitoring the CV and the fact that most real-life data in process monitoring are multivariate in nature, this paper proposes to monitor the multivariate CV in short runs process by means of run rules (RR) control charts. A Markov chain model is established for designing the proposed charts. The statistical performances of the RR multivariate CV (MCV) and Shewhart MCV (SH MCV) charts are compared in terms of the truncated average run length and the expected truncated average run length. The results show that the proposed charts surpass the SH MCV chart for detecting small and moderate multivariate CV shifts. The implementation of the RR MCV chart in the short runs process is illustrated with an example using a real dataset. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Expected truncated average run length; Multivariate coefficient of variation;

There are many control charts, where the coefficient of variation control chart was one of the common charts and greatly used in Statistical Process Control. Since most processes are multivariate, the multivariate coefficient of variation charts has received great attention in the past few years. However, the existing multivariate coefficient of variation control charts was evaluated in terms of the average run length criterion, which may misinterpret the actual performance of the charts. This paper designs an alternative for the Shewhart multivariate coefficient of variation chart by considering the median run length and expected median run-length criteria to circumvent this problem. The research on the multivariate coefficient of variation chart is very limited in the existing literature by considering the median run length criterion. This proposed chart in this paper can minimize this research gap. The formulas and algorithms of the proposed chart are presented. The outputs of the proposed charts are shown by examining the different upward and downward process shifts. Additionally, the sample sizes, the process shifts, and the variation of the run-length distribution are investigated for their effects on the proposed chart. The findings reveal that the run-length distribution’s variation is inversely proportional to the shift size. Furthermore, it shows that the variation decreases if the shift size increases. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Control chart; median run length; multivariate coefficient of variation; statistical process control","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (304 / PKOMP / 6315616)","The Universiti Sains Malaysia supports this work, Short Term Grant [Grant Number: 304 / PKOMP / 6315616], with the project entitled “New Coefficient of Variation Control Charts based on Variable Charting Statistics in Industry 4.0 for the Quality Smart Manufacturing and Services.”.","Adegoke N.

In this study, the run length performance of the synthetic c chart with known process parameter (denoted as the KP-Syn-c chart) and the synthetic c chart with estimated process parameter (denoted as the EP-Syn-c chart) are evaluated in terms of the median run length (MRL). The results show that the sensitivity of the MRL-based EP-Syn-c chart is dependent on the number of preliminary samples used in the Phase-I analysis. Furthermore, percentiles of the run length distribution are used to provide a better understanding for the run length performance of the EP-Syn-c chart. The numerical analysis shows that the required minimum number of preliminary samples can be very large for the MRL-based EP-Syn-c chart to perform similar as the KP-Syn-c chart. An optimization procedure is suggested to compute the design parameters of the EP-Syn-c chart by minimizing the out-of-control MRL. Furthermore, the optimal design procedure of the EP-Syn-c chart is also provided through minimizing the out-of-control expected MRL for the unknown process shift size. An example is provided to illustrate the design and implementation of the MRL-based EP-Syn-c chart. © 2022 International Chinese Association of Quantitative Management.","Estimated process parameter;
