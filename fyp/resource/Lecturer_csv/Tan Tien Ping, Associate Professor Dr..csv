Currently, emotion recognition methods based on deep learning frameworks utilizing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have demonstrated effective application and achieved impressive performance. However, in EEG-based emotion recognition, there exists a significant performance drop in cross-subject EEG Emotion recognition due to inter-individual differences among subjects. In order to address this challenge, a hybrid transfer learning strategy is proposed, and the Domain Adaptation with a Few-shot Fine-tuning Network (DFF-Net) is designed for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. The first step involves the design of a domain adaptive learning module specialized for EEG emotion recognition, known as the Emo-DA module. Following this, the Emo-DA module is utilized to pre-train a model on both the source and target domains. Subsequently, fine-tuning is performed on the target domain specifically for the purpose of cross-subject EEG emotion recognition testing. This comprehensive approach effectively harnesses the attributes of domain adaptation and fine-tuning, resulting in a noteworthy improvement in the accuracy of the model for the challenging task of cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. The proposed DFF-Net surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in the cross-subject EEG emotion recognition task, achieving an average recognition accuracy of 93.37% on the SEED dataset and 82.32% on the SEED-IV dataset.

Malay is the official language in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Brunei. However, Malay spoken in different countries, and even within a country itself might vary in terms of pronunciation and vocabulary from one place to another. The Malay dialects in Malaysia can be grouped according to the states of the country. In this paper, we propose the architecture of a Malay dialect translation and synthesis system, that given a sentence in standard Malay, it translates and synthesizes an utterance in the dialect requested. The system consists of 3 modules, dialect translation system, dialect G2P system, and speech synthesis system. The outcome from this study is two folds. From linguistic viewpoint, it will help us understanding and appreciating the interesting differences in the Malay dialect in Malaysia, which is important to help preserve the dialect and culture in it.

Existing resources such as translated documents, bilingual dictionaries, and translated subtitles are excellent resources for constructing parallel text corpus. A sentence alignment algorithm automatically aligns source sentences and target sentences because manual sentence alignment is resource-intensive. Over the years, sentence alignment approaches have improved from sentence length heuristics to statistical lexical models to deep neural networks. Solving the alignment problem as a classification problem is interesting as classification is the core of machine learning. This paper proposes a parallel long-short-term memory with attention and convolutional neural network (parallel LSTM+Attention+CNN) for classifying two sentences as parallel or non-parallel sentences. A sliding window approach is also proposed with the classifier to align sentences in the source and target languages. The proposed approach was compared with three classifiers, namely the feedforward neural network, CNN, and bi-directional LSTM. It is also compared with the BleuAlign sentence alignment system. The classification accuracy of these models was evaluated using Malay-English parallel text corpus and UN French-English parallel text corpus. The Malay-English sentence alignment performance was then evaluated using research documents and the very challenging Classical Malay-English document. The proposed classifier obtained more than 80% accuracy in categorizing parallel/non-parallel sentences with a model built using only five thousand training parallel sentences. It has a higher sentence alignment accuracy than other baseline systems. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Attention; Cnn; Lstm; Parallel text; Sentence alignment","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This research was supported by The Research University Grant (RUI) (1001.

The translation produced by an SMT is based on the statistical analysis of text corpora, while NMT uses the deep neural network to model and to generate a translation. SMT and NMT have their strength and weaknesses. SMT may produce a better translation with a small parallel text corpus compared to NMT. Nevertheless, when the amount of parallel text available is large, the quality of the translation produced by NMT is often higher than SMT. Besides that, study also shown that the translation produced by SMT is better than NMT in cases where there is a domain mismatch between training and testing. SMT also has an advantage in long sentences. In addition, when a translation produced by an NMT is wrong, it is very difficult to find the error. In this paper, we investigate a hybrid approach that combines SMT and NMT to perform English to Malay translation. The motivation for using a hybrid machine translation is to combine the strength of both approaches to produce a more accurate translation. Our approach uses the multi-source encoder-decoder long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. The architecture uses two encoders, one to embed the sentence to be translated, and another encoder to embed the initial translation produced by SMT. The translation from the SMT can be viewed as a ""suggestion translation"" to the neural MT. Our experiments show that the hybrid MT increases the BLEU scores of our best baseline machine translation in the computer science domain and news domain from 21.21 and 48.35 to 35.97 and 61.81 respectively. © 2018, Insight Society.","Hybrid machine translation; Neural machine translation; Statistical machine translation","","","","","","","","Bahdanau D., Cho K., Bengio Y., ""Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate"", (2014); Luong T., Pham H., Manning D.C., Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation,, Proc.

Supporting the probable customers with a list of the most representative product aspects will assist their purchasing decision and facilitate the comparative process among the presented products. For the firms, identifying critical product aspects creates a new perspective of product manufacturing and marketing strategies to be competitive and innovative. However the manual identification of the most representative product aspects from the huge amounts of the extracted product aspects in online reviews is a tedious and time-consuming task. Thus, ranking the extracted aspects becomes a necessity to identify the important product aspects mentioned in the customer reviews. The purpose of this study is to formulate the product aspect ranking problem as a decision making process using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). In response, a comparative analysis between two different MCDM ranking approaches, namely; TOPSIS and VIKOR has been conducted to investigate their performances in prioritizing the most important product aspects in customer reviews. The experimental results on different product reviews demonstrate the effectiveness of these two methods in prioritizing the genuine product aspects in customer feedback. © 2017 IEEE.","Aspect ranking; MCDM; Product aspect; Sentiment analysis; TOPSIS; VIKOR","Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Marketing; Aspect ranking; MCDM; Product aspects; Sentiment analysis; TOPSIS; VIKOR; Sales","","","","","","","Hu M., Liu B., Mining opinion features in customer reviews, 19th Natl.

Accented speech imposes accuracy problem in automatic speech recognition systems. This frequently occurs to non-native speakers of a language due to insufficiency of the non-natives data in the recognizers. In this study, we investigate the mentioned problem by building a Malay model in our recognizer and test its performance for speakers of various ethnicities. Our Malay corpora consist of read speeches and texts that are collected from local newspapers in Malaysia. Speakers who contributed the speeches are of different ethnic backgrounds. We employ context dependent models by applying linear discriminant analysis for our acoustic model and a trigram based language model. Our experiments show improved results when linear discriminant analysis technique was employed in our model while our recognizer performed worst for speakers with accent that are not available in the training data. © 2012 IEEE.","Accent-specific speech recognition; Context dependent models; Malay automatic speech recognition system; RASR","Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Accuracy problems; Automatic speech recognition system; Context-dependent models; Different origins; Linear discriminant analysis; Non-native speakers; RASR; Speech recognition performance; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Hussain A., Othman M., Shariff Z.A.M.D., Recurrent backpropagation neural subnetworks for phoneme based malay speech recognition, ISPACS 97, (1997); Fledge J., Second Language Speech Learning:theory, pp. 223-277, (1995); Maris Y.M., The Malay Sound System, (1979); Tan T.P., Li H., Tang E.K., Xiao X., Chng E.S., Mass: A malay language lvsr corpus resource, Proc. of 2009 Oriental COCOSDA International Conference, pp. 26-30, (2009); Rainavo-Malancon B., Computational Analysis of Affixed Words in Malay Language, (2004); Tan T.P., Rainavo-Malancon B., Malay grapheme to phoneme tool for automatic speech recognition, Proc.

Existing studies heavily rely on sentiment classification methods that require fully annotated inputs. However, there is limited labelled text available, making the acquirement process of the fully annotated input costly and labour-intensive. Lately, semi-supervised methods emerge as they require only partially labelled input but perform comparably to supervised methods. Nevertheless, some works reported that the performance of the semi-supervised model degraded after adding unlabelled instances into training. Literature also shows that not all unlabelled instances are equally useful; thus identifying the informative unlabelled instances is beneficial in training a semi-supervised model. To achieve this, an informative score is proposed and incorporated into semisupervised sentiment classification. The evaluation is performed on a semisupervised method without an informative score and with an informative score. By using the informative score in the instance selection strategy to identify informative unlabelled instances, semi-supervised models perform better compared to models that do not incorporate informative scores into their training. Although the performance of semi-supervised models incorporated with an informative score is not able to surpass the supervised models, the results are still found promising as the differences in performance are subtle with a small difference of 2% to 5%, but the number of labelled instances used is greatly reduced from100% to 40%. The best finding of the proposed instance selection strategy is achieved when incorporating an informative score with a baseline confidence score at a 0.5:0.5 ratio using only 40% labelled data. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

While previous works have focused on improving the accuracy of legal judgment prediction, the lack of explainability seriously limits the practical application of these methods. Many researchers have dedicated effort to extracting or generating rationales as explanations for legal judgments, ignoring the factual consistency of these rationales. Inconsistencies between rationales and fact descriptions severely impact their applicability. To address these issues, we investigate Event Chain – ordered sequences of events related to criminal behavior – as an intermediate representation in the fact descriptions, to enhance the representation of causal relationships among events, and focus on crucial events within the fact description. Specifically, we propose a multi-task learning approach, dubbed LegalMind, that introduces Event Chain as an auxiliary task and jointly models Event Chain and rationale in a unified decoder, to improve factual consistency in rationale generation. The experiment results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 7.65% and 6.65% in AVG-BLEU on the CJO dataset and LAIC2021 dataset respectively compared to BART-C3VG. Furthermore, in comparison to BART-C3VG, our model demonstrated superior performance with increases of 6.17% and 8.33% in factual consistency on the CJO and LAIC2021 datasets, respectively. © 2023 The Authors","Event Chain; Explanation; Factual consistency; Legal judgments; Rationale generation","","","","","","Key Scientific Research Project of Hunan Provincial Department of Education, (20A123); Key Special Education Project of Hunan Provincial Social Science Foundation, (18ZDJ01)","We thank to all the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and to Elsevier for their support in the publication process.

These reviews provide a significant basis on which potential customers can select the product that best meets their preferences. In online reviews, customers describe positive or negative experiences with a product or service or any part of it (i.e. features). Consumers frequently experience difficulty finding the desired product for comparison because of the massive number of online reviews. The automatic extraction of important product features is necessary to support customers in search of relevant product features. These features are the criteria that make it possible for customers to characterise different types of products. This article proposes a domain independent approach for identifying explicit opinionated features and attributes that are strongly related to a specific domain product using lexicographer files in WordNet. In our approach, N_gram analysis and the SentiStrength opinion lexicon have been employed to support the extraction of opinionated features. The empirical evaluation of the proposed system using online reviews of two popular datasets of supervised and unsupervised systems showed that our approach achieved competitive results for feature extraction from product reviews. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Feature extraction;

Assessing features of online content including topics and sentiments against vaccines could help curb the spread of vaccine-related misinformation and allow stakeholders to draft better regulations and public policies. Using a public dataset extracted from Reddit, the authors performed text analytics including sentiment analysis, N-gram, and topic modeling to grasp the sentiments, the most popular phrases (N-grams), and topics of the subreddit. The sentiment analysis results revealed mostly positive sentiments in the subreddit 's discussions. The N-gram analysis identified ""cause autism"" and ""MMR cause autism"" as the most frequent bigram and trigram.

Solving SOP requires finding a feasible Hamiltonian path with minimum cost without violating the precedence constraints. SOP models myriad of real world industrial applications, particularly in the fields of transportation, vehicle routing and production planning. The main objective of this research is to propose an idea of solving SOP using the Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) algorithm. The underlying mechanism of the BCO algorithm is the bee foraging behavior in a typical bee colony. Throughout the research, the SOP benchmark problems from TSPLIB will be chosen as the testbed to evaluate the performance of the BCO algorithm in terms of the solution cost and the computational time needed to obtain an optimum solution. Moreover, efforts are taken to investigate the feasibility of using the Genetic Algorithm to optimally tune the parameters equipped in the existing BCO model. On average, over the selected 40 benchmark problems, the proposed method has successfully solved 9 (22.5%) benchmark problems to optimum, 17 (42.5%) benchmark problems ≤ 1% of deviation from the known optimum, and 37 (85%) benchmark problems ≤ 5% of deviation from the known optimum. Overall, the 40 benchmark problems are solved to 2.19% from the known optimum on average. © 2014 IEEE.","combinatorial optimization problem; genetic algorithm; local search; metaheuristic; path repairing procedure","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Production control; Repair; Bee colony optimizations; Combinatorial optimization problems; Local search; Metaheuristic; Precedence constraints; Production Planning; Repairing procedures; Sequential ordering problems; Optimization","","","","","","","Montemanni R., Smith D.H., Rizzoli A.E., Gambardella L.M., Sequential ordering problems for crane scheduling in port terminals, International Journal of Simulation and Process Modelling, 5, 4, pp. 348-361, (2009); Spieckermann S., Gutenschwager K., Vob S., A sequential ordering problem in automotive paint shops, International Journal of Production Research, 42, 9, pp. 1865-1878, (2004); Wong L.P., Low M.Y.H., Chong C.S., A generic bee colony optimization framework for combinatorial optimization problems, Proceedings of the 4th Asia International Conference on Mathematical/ Analytical Modelling and Computer Simulation.

The Malay dialects in Malaysia can be grouped according to the states such as Perak dialect, Kedah dialect and Terengganu dialect. It is important to learn Malay dialects as it is still flourished and widely used in many areas especially for unofficial matters.

It provides an opportunity to harness a lot of idle peer-resources such as desktop computers across the Internet, for solving large-scale computing applications. Each peer is autonomous and it needs incentive for sustained contribution of its resources to P2P applications. In addition, a flexible and efficient job scheduling is needed to harvest the idle computing power as cheaply and economically as possible. This paper introduces an economic based job scheduler for mapping jobs to resources in P2P computing environment. The scheduler has been implemented with the Compute Power Market (CPM) system developed using Sun JXTA P2P technology. Our scheduler can be configured depending on users' quality of service requirements such as the deadline and budget constraints. Our scheduler follows a hierarchy scheme.

Most of the conducted research studies extract the product aspects based on three main criteria: 1) extracting the aspects that have been commented repeatedly in online reviews, 2) determining of important aspects as those that have been described positively and negatively by many customers in their reviews, and 3) the association between the domain product aspect (like 'camera') and the other aspects contained in a specific product review. However, a lacuna remains as how to efficiently investigate online reviews to identify the most important product aspects by considering all the three criteria jointly. In response, this paper proposes a novel product aspect ranking framework using sentiment analysis and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution). The proposed work is decomposed into two stages: aspect extraction and aspect ranking. In aspect extraction stage, sentiment analysis is used to identify the product aspects from customer reviews in an unsupervised manner based on the three criteria of extraction. In the second stage, the extracted product aspects from the previous criteria have been involved simultaneously in TOPSIS to produce a ranked list of the most representative product aspects. The empirical evaluation of the proposed work using online reviews of four products shows its effectiveness in finding representative aspects. © 2016 IEEE.","Aspect ranking; MCDM; Sentiment analysis; TOPSIS; WordNet","Extraction; Information retrieval; Knowledge management; Sales; Aspect ranking; MCDM; Sentiment analysis; TOPSIS; Wordnet; Data mining","","","","","","","Liu B., Sentiment analysis and opinion mining, Synth.

Reviews with multiple aspects are sometimes problematic because some of the aspects mentioned are of little or no relevance to either consumers or providers. Hence, it is important to identify relevant aspects of a product by ranking them in the order of their importance. With that, this chapter introduces a new criterion known as Aspect Relevancy in the process of ranking aspects. The study also incorporates multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) to recognize vital aspects retrieved from the consumers reviews of products and services. In ranking the selected aspects, the subjective technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is employed. The experimental results using Bing Liu and SemEval 2016 Task 5 datasets have demonstrated positive outcome of the proposed approach when compared with two baseline approaches in terms of NDCG@k ranking measure. © 2022 IGI Global.

This approach combines the hypotheses produced by parallel automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Each ASR system uses different language models, one which is generic domain model and another is domain specific model. The main idea is to take advantage of different ASR knowledge to improve ASR decoding result. It uses the language score and time information to produce a 1-best lattice, and then rescore the 1-best lattice to get the most likely word sequence as the final output. The proposed approach was compared with conventional combination approach, the recognizer output voting error reduction (ROVER). Our proposed approach improved the word error rate (WER) from 33.9% to 30.6% with an average relative WER improvement of 9.74%, and it is better than the conventional ROVER approach. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

Experiment shows that the proposed approach reduction of more than 5% WER, when tested on English/Malay code switching speech. In addition, the framework has shown to be very robust.

Most previous studies either focused on enhancing LJP's performance while ignoring the issue of confusing charges and law articles, or only used law articles to improve the judgment of confusing verdicts, resulting in the limited model performance. This paper introduces legal charge knowledge as a type of knowledge to enhance the representation of fact descriptions and incorporates it into deep neural networks. We then propose a Knowledge-enriched Multi-Cross Attention Network (KEMCAN) to improve LJP's performance, and resolve legal cases involving confusing charges and law articles. Specifically, a cross-attention mechanism is proposed to model the relationship between legal charge knowledge and fact description in a unified model. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets, achieving an average improvement of 3.95% in macro-F1 for charge prediction and 1.98% for law article prediction.  © 2013 IEEE.","confusing charges and law articles; legal charge knowledge; Legal judgment prediction; multi-cross attention","Deep neural networks; Job analysis; Knowledge engineering; Confusing charge and law article; Deep learning; Law; Legal charge knowledge; Legal judgements; Legal judgment prediction; Multi-cross attention; Predictive models; Task analysis; Urban areas; Forecasting","","","","","","","Hu Z., Li X., Tu C., Liu Z., Sun M., Few-shot charge prediction with discriminative legal attributes, Proc. 27th Int.

To begin this study, we collected 8 hours of speech data due to no resources yet for ASR concerning this language. Following the lack of resources, we employed bootstrapping techniques on a closely-related language to build the Iban system. For this case, we utilized Malay data to bootstrap the grapheme-to-phoneme system (G2P) for the target language. We also developed several G2Ps to acquire Iban pronunciation dictionaries, which were later evaluated on the Iban ASR for obtaining the best version. Subsequently, we conducted experiments on cross-lingual ASR by using subspace Gaussian Mixture Models (SGMM) where the shared parameters obtained in either monolingual or multilingual fashion. From our observations, using out-of-language data as source language provided lower WER when Iban data is very imited. © 2014 IEEE.","acoustic modelling; automatic speech recognition; bootstrapping grapheme-to-phoneme; subspace Gaussian mixture model","Communication channels (information theory); Computational linguistics; Object recognition; Speech; Acoustic modelling; Automatic speech recognition; Automatic speech recognition system; Grapheme to phonemes; Pronunciation dictionaries; Subspace Gaussian Mixture Models; Target language; Under-resourced languages; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Besacier L., Barnard E., Karpov A., Schultz T., Automatic speech recognition for under-resourced languages: A survey, Speech Communication Journal, 56, pp. 85-100, (2014); Maskey S.R., Black A.W., Tomokiyo L.M., Bootstrapping phonetic lexicons for language, Proc.

It has been validated in the context of the ""Star Challenge"" search engine competition organized by the A*STAR Agency of Singapore. Our approach includes the building of an IPA-based multilingual acoustic model and a dynamic programming based method for searching document segments by ""IPA string spotting"". Dynamic programming allows for retrieving the query string in the document string even with a significant transcription error rate at the phone level. The methods that we developed ranked us as first and third on the monolingual (English) search task, as fifth on the multilingual search task and as first on the multimodal (audio and image) search task.","Audio retrieval; Dynamic programming; International phonetic alphabet; Multilingual; Star challenge","Dynamic programming; Search engines; Stars; Audio retrieval; Audio-visual document; Content retrieval; Content-based indexing and retrieval; Error rate; International Phonetic Alphabet; Multi-lingual search; Multi-modal; Multilingual; Multilingual acoustic models; Query string; Search tasks; Singapore; Information retrieval","","","","","","","Ayache S., Quenot G., Image and video indexing using networks of operators, J.

Manual news transcription is too expensive and takes a long time. Hence, without an ASR system, access to audio archives and searches within them would be restricted to the limited number of textual documents that have been manually transcribed by humans or indexed with keywords. Multiple hypotheses are useful because the single best recognition output still has numerous errors, even for state-of-The-Art systems. In this paper, we propose an approach to reduce the word error rate (WER) in an ASR hypothesis. This approach is known as the three-pass combination method using parallel ASR systems. The three-pass combination system based on grapheme rescoring and phone rescoring re-evaluates all of the hypotheses produced by the ASR systems to produce a more accurate hypothesis. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, Malay broadcast news contains speech from newscaster, reporter and interviewers in noisy environments recorded from Malaysia local news channels are employed. This approach reduced the WER by 4.4% from 34.5% to 30.1%. The performance of the proposed approach was compared with six approaches that are frequently used for ASR rescoring and combination. © 2015 IEEE.","ASR Combination; Automatic Speech Recognition; Broadcast News;

Despite the existence of standard bilingual alignment corpora, they often fall short in covering low-resource languages and specific domains, underscoring the need for advanced sentence alignment algorithms. We explore the potential of the GPT model for sentence alignment, focusing on aspects like prompt construction, experiment design, and results evaluation. Utilizing the OPUS corpus, our experimental design covers eight commonly used languages in 28 directions. The study reveals that the GPT-aligner outperforms traditional algorithms by 5-30% in most scenarios, with the performance contingent on language, prompting, the GPT system model, and few-shot demonstration strategies.

Code switching is the switching of a language in a sentence or speech utterance. This paper focuses on LID of words in code switching sentences. Code switching can occur intersentential or intrasentential. The reasons why a writer switches from one language to another due to various reasons and among them are the inability to express opinion in a particular target language, to attract attention, to address different audience, habitual expressions and so on. The difficulty in identifying the languages of each word in a code switching sentence is because the languages have the same character set. In addition, code switching can happen in a sentence as short as a word or as long as a sentence. In this paper, we propose an automatic LID for words in code switching sentences by using multi structural word information (MUSWI) such as grapheme, syllable and word structure and calculate by using n-gram statistical model. The proposed MUSWI approach achieves 96.36% in term of accuracy on the code switching sentences, 99.07% on the multilingual sentences (non-code switching) which are under-resourced and closely related languages.

The proposed clustering method does not require users to predefined number of clusters. The three main stages of the clustering are sentences segmentation, indexing, and also term and sentence matching clustering. The sentences in the transcription will be segmented before indexing. Indexing involves tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, term selection and term representation. A vector space model (VSM) is used to represent the terms and sentences in the form of vectors. The sentences will then be grouped into clusters by using term and sentence matching thresholds. The proposed approach shows a significantly better accuracy than the baseline approaches. © 2013 IEEE.","Broadcast news; Clustering; Transcription","Natural language processing systems; Transcription; Vector spaces; Broadcast news; Clustering; Clustering methods; Matching criterion; Number of clusters; Rule-based approach; Term representation; Vector space models; Indexing (of information)","","","","","","","Feldman R., Sanger J., The Text Mining Handbook: Advanced Approaches in Analyzing Unstructured Data, (2008); Jain A.K., Murty M.N., Flynn P.J., Data clustering: A review, ACM Computing Surveys, 31, 3, (1999); Hung J.-W., Wang H.-M., Lee L.-S., Automatic metric-based speech segmentation for broadcast news via principle component analysis, Interspeech 2000, (2000); Xie L., Zheng L., Liu Z., Zhang Y., Laplacian eigenmaps for automatic story segmentation of broadcast news, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 20, 1, (2012); Michael E.-S.A., Samhaa E.-B.R., Comparative analysis of different text segmentation algorithms on arabic news stories, IEEE, (2007); Ibrahimov O., Sethi I., Dimitrova N., Novel similarity based clustering algorithm for grouping broadcast news, Proc. of SPIE Conf.

However, the Chinese poker game, DouDiZhu presents new challenges for AI systems to overcome, including infering imperfect information, training with sparse rewards, and handling a large state-action space. This article describes our proposed DouDiZhu AI system, RARSMSDou, based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms that combines Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Relative Advantage Reward Shaping with Minimum Splits (RARSMS), and Deep Monte-Carlo (DMC) into a self-play framework. In RARSMSDou, we propose RARSMS as a novel intrinsic reward to guide the training for PPO in a sparse reward environment. We treat the imperfect information as observable information and feed it into the critic-network of PPO, and we propose abstract actions to simplify the large-action space (27,472 actions) to a low-dimensional action space (309 actions contain 189 specific actions and 120 abstract actions) which is output by the policy network of PPO. When the policy is an abstract action, DMC (DouZeroX) maps this abstract action to its specific action as a policy for training or execution. We compare the performance of RARSMSDou with its four variants (PPO, PPO+RARSMS, PPO+DMC, DMC (DouZeroX)) and five state-of-the-art DouDiZhu AI programs. The experiment results show that after 30 days of self-play and training, RARSMSDou outperforms its variants and DouZero (with a WP of 0.582 and an ADP of 0.414), which is the best DouDiZhu baseline.

Timeliness of data is important in making major decision. However, the manual data labeling method is slow and expensive, it also cannot cope with this enormous amount of data. We investigated the literature of sentiment analysis and discovered most of the works using manual data labeling. We propose semi-supervised learning as a method that helps to reducing the effort and time needed in data labeling as it uses a combination of small amount of labeled data and a large pool of unlabeled data for model training. In our work, we trained semi-supervised deep neural network with different settings and compared the model performances to a baseline, the supervised deep neural network trained with same number of labeled data. From the results, we can see that the unlabeled data is useful in improving the data performances. But it is not a guarantee, the unlabeled data must be handled with care otherwise degraded the model performances. © 2019 The Authors.","Deep learning; Semi-supervised learning; Sentiment classification","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Information systems; Information use; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Supervised learning; Data labeling; Data performance; Model performance; Model training; Semi- supervised learning; Semi-supervised; Sentiment classification; Unlabeled data; Classification (of information)","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9)","This research is supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE) under the project code, FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/USM/02/9 and title, Automated Big Data Annotation for Training Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Model in Sentiment Classification.","Liu, Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining, (2012); Hutto C.J., Gilbert E., Vader: A parsimonious rule-based model for sentiment analysis of social media text, Proceedings of the Eighth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 216-225, (2014); Priyani G., Gupta V., Singh V.K., Ghose U., A linguistic rule-based approach for aspect-level sentiment analysis of movie reviews, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, (2017); Agarwal B., Mittal N., Machine learning approach for sentiment analysis, Socio-Affective Computing, pp. 21-45, (2015); Chiong R., Et al., A sentiment analysis-based machine learning approach for financial market prediction via news disclosures, Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion on - GECCO'18, pp. 278-279, (2018); Tripathy A., Agrawal A., Rath S.K., Classification of sentiment reviews using n-gram machine learning approach, Expert Systems with Applications, 57, pp. 117-126, (2016); Fernandez-Gavilanes, Alvarez-Lopez, Juncal-Martinez, Costa-Montenegro, Gonzalez-Castano, Unsupervised method for sentiment analysis in online texts, Expert Systems with Applications, 58, pp. 57-75, (2016); Tan, Phang, Chin, Anthony, Rule-based sentiment analysis for financial news, IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, pp. 1601-1606, (2015); Na, Kyaing, Khoo, Foo, Chang, Theng, Sentiment classification of drug reviews using a rule-based linguistic approach, ICADL 2012: The Outreach of Digital Libraries: A Globalized Resource Network, (2012); Prabowo, Thelwall, Sentiment analysis: A combined approach, Journal of Informetrics, 3, 2, pp. 143-157, (2009); Faulkner, Automated classification of stance in student essays: An approach using stance target information and the wikipedia link-based measure, Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, pp. 174-179, (2014); Lane, Clarke, Hender, On developing robust models for favourability analysis: Model choice, feature sets and imbalanced data, Decision Support Systems, 53, 4, pp. 712-718, (2012); Araque, Corcuera-Platas, Sanchez-Rada, Iglesias, Enhancing deep learning sentiment analysis with ensemble techniques in social applications, Expert Systems with Applications, 77, pp. 236-246, (2017); Hassan, Mahmood, Deep learning approach for sentiment analysis of short texts, 3rd International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR), pp. 705-710, (2017); Dai, Le, Semi-supervised Sequence Learning, NIPS'15 Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3079-3087, (2015); Iosifidis, Ntoutsi, Large scale sentiment learning with limited labels, Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining - KDD'17, pp. 1823-1832, (2017); Levatic, Ceci, Kocev, Dzeroski, Semi-supervised Classification Trees, Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 49, 3, pp. 461-486, (2017); Pang, Lee, Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales, ACL'05 Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 115-124, (2005); Guan, Chen, Zhao, Zheng, Tan, Cai, Weakly-supervised deep learning for customer review sentiment classification, IJCAI'16 Proceedings of the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 3719-3725, (2016)","K.H.

The attractiveness of LSTM networks is its strength in modeling long distance dependencies. Malay POS tagging is examined from two different conditions: with and without morphological information.

Standard Malay is used as a source language whereas Kelantanese Malay is chosen to be target language in this study. Kelantan dialect is a Malay dialect from the northeast of Peninsular Malaysia. One of the most important steps and time consuming in building a HMM acoustic model is the alignment of speech sound. A good alignment will produce a clear and natural synthesize speech. The importance of this study is to propose a quick approach for aligning and building a good dialectal speech synthesis acoustic model by using a different source acoustic model. There are two proposed adaptation approaches in this study to synthesize dialectal Malay sentences using different amount of target speech and a source acoustic model to build the target acoustic model of speech synthesis system. From the results, we found out that the dialectal speech synthesis system built with adaptation approaches are much better in term of speech quality compared to the one without applying adaptation approach. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

The proposed method concatenates these floating stems with the base words using Malay linguistic knowledge. The proposed method on Malay LVCSR for smaller training size of 11 thousands sentences can reduce the word error rate by 0.3%. The positive improvements are consistent for all tested different smoothing methods and training transcription sizes. ©2010 IEEE.","Agglutinative language; Language modeling; Linguistic stem; LVCSR; Speech recognition","Computational linguistics; Continuous speech recognition; Innovation; Vocabulary control; Agglutinative language; Language modeling; Large vocabulary continuous speech recognition; Large vocabulary speech recognition; Linguistic knowledge; LVCSR; Smoothing methods; Training size; Word error rate; Engineering research","","","","","","","Karim N.S., Onn F.M., Musa H.Hj., Mahmood A.H., Tatabahasa Dewan, (2006); Ranaivo-Malancon B., Computational Analysis of Affixed Words in Malay Language; Zahid I., Omar M.S., Fonetik Dan Fonologi, (2006); Chen S.F., Goodman J., An Empirical Study of Smoothing Techniques for Language Modeling, (1998); Tan T.-P., Xiao X., Tang E.K., Chng E.S., Li H., MASS: A Malay language LVCSR corpus resource, 2009 Oriental COCOSDA International Conference on Speech Database and Assessment, 10-12 August 2009, pp. 25-30","H.

Two existing pronunciation modeling approaches, namely the pronunciation dictionary and n-best rescoring approach are modified to work with little amount of non-native speech. We also propose a speaker clustering approach, which capable of grouping the speakers based on their pronunciation habits. Given some speech, the approach can also be used for pronunciation adaptation. This approach is called latent pronunciation analysis. The results show that conventional pronunciation dictionary perform slightly better than n-best list rescoring, while the latent pronunciation analysis has shown to be beneficial for speaker clustering, and it can produce nearly the same improvement as the pronunciation dictionary approach, without the need to know the origin of the speaker.

The pronunciation of a word is determined by the sequence of phonemes or some speech sounds. Each language or dialect might have different phoneme set. However, there is often a lack of phonological study for a dialect. The number of phonemes is unknown for some of the dialects or languages without a written form. In this work, we propose an approach to identify the phonemes for a dialect from the dialect text transcript and speech corpus, leveraging on existing resources from standard language and multilingual resources.

In this study, an architecture of speech corpus acquisition, which including Malay dialect translation and Malay dialect grapheme to phoneme (G2P), was proposed. The pronunciation dictionary for dialectal Malay was generated through G2P tool. As dialectal Malay is considered as scarce resource, dialectal translation rules were developed for translating standard Malay text into dialectal Malay. With this, Kelantanese Malay is chosen in this research as it is considered as one of the Malay dialect from Kelantan, which positioned in the northeast of Peninsular Malaysia. This dialect is very distinctive. Evaluation results showed that the selected sentences through proposed approach has a correlation coefficient of about 0.99, which mean that it is phonetically well balanced. © 2nd Workshop on Speech, Language and Audio in Multimedia, SLAM 2014.","Malay dialect grapheme to phoneme; Malay dialect translation; speech synthesis corpus","Translation (languages); Grapheme to phonemes; Malay dialect grapheme to phoneme; Malay dialect translation; Malay texts; Pronunciation dictionaries; Scarce resources; Speech corpora; Speech synthesis corpus; Speech synthesis system; Translation rules; Speech synthesis","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This project is supported by the research university grant 1001/PKOMP/817068 from Universiti Sains Malaysia.","O'Grady W., Archibald J., Contemporary Linguistic Analysis: An Introduction, (2000); Lee K.-F, Hon H.-W, Reddy R., An overview of the SPHINX speech recognition system, Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on, pp. 35-45, (1990); Abdul H., Sintaksis Dialek Kelantan, Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, (1994); Uneson Marcus, Tone restoration in transcribed Kammu: decision-list word sense disambiguation for an unwritten language, Linkoping Electronic Conference Proceedings, 85, pp. 399-410, (2013); Mosel U., Universitat Kiel, Collecting data for grammars of previously unresearched languages, Draft for the International LingDy Symposium on Grammar Writing, (2009); Hanke F.

The traditional approaches to train language model are mainly based on Chomsky hierarchy type 3 that approximates natural language as regular language. This approach ignores the characteristics of natural language. Our work attempted to overcome these limitations by extending the approach to consider Chomsky hierarchy type 1 and type 2. We extracted the dependency tree based lexical information and incorporate the information into the language model. The second pass lattice rescoring was performed to produce better hypotheses for Malay large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system.

Solving ATSP is NP-hard and it is harder if the problem is with large scale data. This paper intends to address the ATSP using an hybrid approach which integrates the generic Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) framework and an insertion-based local search procedure. The generic BCO framework computationally realizes the bee foraging behaviour in a typical bee colony where bees travel across different locations to discover new food sources and perform waggle dances to recruit more bees towards newly discovered food sources. Besides the bee foraging behaviour, the generic BCO framework is enriched with an initialization engine, a fragmented solution construction mechanism, a local search and a pruning strategy. When the proposed algorithm is tested on a set of 27 ATSP benchmark problem instances, 37% of the benchmark instances are constantly solved to optimum. 89% of the problem instances are optimally solved for at least once. On average, the proposed BCO algorithm is able to obtain 0.140% deviation from known optimum for all the 27 instances. In terms of the average computational time, the proposed algorithm requires 48.955s (< 1 minutes) to obtain the best tour length for each instance. © 2013 IEEE.","bee foraging behaviour; generic framework; insertion; local search; metaheuristic","Benchmarking; Combinatorial optimization; Local search (optimization); Operations research; Systems analysis; Foraging behaviours; Generic frameworks; insertion; Local search; Metaheuristic; Traveling salesman problem","","","","","","","Wong L.P., Low M.Y.H., Chong C.S., A generic bee colony optimization framework for combinatorial optimization problems, Proceedings or the 4th Asia International Conference on Mathematical/ Analytical Modelling and Computer Simulation.

These works on multilingual acoustic modeling often use multilingual acoustic models to create an initial model. This initial model created is often suboptimal in decoding speech of the target language. Some speech of the target language is then used to adapt and improve the initial model. In this paper however, we investigate multilingual acoustic modeling in enhancing an acoustic model of the target language for automatic speech recognition system. The proposed approach employs context dependent acoustic model merging of a source language to adapt acoustic model of a target language. The source and target language speech are spoken by speakers from the same country.

Communication and interaction between human and machine using speech become increasingly important, since it is an obvious substitute for keyboards and screens in the communication process. Therefore, numerous technologies take advantage of speech such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), where human natural speech for many languages is used as the means to interact with machines. Majority of the related works on ASR concentrate on the development and evaluation of ASR systems that serve a single language only, such as Arabic, English, Chinese, French, and many others. However, research attempts that combine multiple languages (bilingual and multilingual) during the development and evaluation of ASR systems are very limited. This paper aims to provide comprehensive research background and fundamentals of bilingual ASR, and related works that have combined two languages for ASR tasks from 2010 to 2021. It also formulates research taxonomy and discusses open challenges to the bilingual ASR research. Based on our literature investigation, it is clear that bilingual ASR using deep learning approach is highly demanded and is able to provide acceptable performance. In addition, many combinations of two languages such as Arabic-English, Arabic-Malay, and others, are still limited, which can open new research opportunities. Finally, it is clear that ASR research is moving towards not only bilingual ASR, but also multilingual ASR.  © 2013 IEEE.","ASR; ASR architecture; bilingual ASR; code mixing; code switching; cross lingual; deep learning","Codes (symbols); Deep learning; Feature extraction; Intelligent systems; Speech communication; Speech recognition; Automatic speech recognition; Automatic speech recognition architecture; Bilingual automatic speech recognition; Bilinguals; Code; Code-mixing; Code-switching; Cross-lingual; Deep learning; Features extraction; Hidden-Markov models; Speech recognition architectures; Task analysis; Hidden Markov models","","","","","","","Hamed I., Elmahdy M., Abdennadher S., Building a first language model for code-switch Arabic-English, Proc.

The corpus is recorded under unscripted interview and conversational settings from 157 Singaporean and Malaysian speakers who spoke a mixture of Mandarin and English within a single sentence. About 82 % of the transcribed utterances are intra-sentential code-switching speech and the corpus will be release by LDC in 2015. This paper presents an analysis of the code-switching statistics of the corpus, such as the duration of monolingual segments and the frequency of language turns in code-switch utterances. We also summarize the development effort, details such as the processing time for transcription, validation and language boundary labelling. Lastly, we present textual analyses of code-switch segments examining the word length of monolingual segments in code-switch utterances and the most common single word and two-word phrase of such segments. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Code-switching speech; Language recognition; Mandarin–English; Speech recognition; Spontaneous spoken corpus development","","","","","","","","Auer P., Code-switching in conversation: Language, interaction and identity, (1998); Bullock B.E., Toribio A.J., The Cambridge handbook of linguistic code-switch, (2009); Demographic Characteristics, Education, Language and Religion, Department of Statistics, Ministry of Trade & Industry, Republic of Singapore, January, (2011); Chan H.S., Code-mixing in Hong Kong Cantonese–English bilinguals: Constraints and processes.

Deep learning-based EEG emotion classification algorithms have made encouraging progress, but existing models struggle with capturing long-range dependence and integrating temporal, frequency, and spatial domain features that limit their classification ability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Bi-branch Vision Transformer- based EEG emotion recognition model, Bi-ViTNet, that integrates spatial-temporal and spatial-frequency feature representations. Specifically, Bi-ViTNet is composed of spatial-frequency feature extraction branch and spatial-temporal feature extraction branch that fuse spatial-frequency-temporal features in a unified framework. Each branch is composed of Linear Embedding and Transformer Encoder, which is used to extract spatial-frequency features and spatial-temporal features. Finally, fusion and classification are performed by the Fusion and Classification layer. Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV datasets demonstrate that Bi-ViTNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. © 2013 IEEE.","Affective computing; EEG-based emotion recognition; transformer","Biomedical signal processing; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Extraction; Feature extraction; Speech recognition; Affective Computing; Brain modeling; Deep learning; Electroencephalogram-based emotion recognition; Emotion recognition; Features extraction; Spatial frequency; Transformer; Emotion Recognition","","","","","","","Zuo X., Zhang C., Hamalainen T., Gao H., Fu Y., Cong F., Crosssubject emotion recognition using fused entropy features of EEG, Entropy, 24, 9, (2022); Jia Z., Lin Y., Wang J., Feng Z., Xie X., Chen C., HetEmotionNet: Two-stream heterogeneous graph recurrent neural network for multi-modal emotion recognition, Proc. 29th ACMInt.

However, if the summary was extracted 'verbatim' from its source, the sentence may contain inessential information along with salient information that may effect on the overall coherence in the summary generation. The purpose of Sentence Compression in Text Summarization is to produce a compact and informational content by eliminating unnecessary constituent in a sentence. We introduce a Pattern-Growth text representation model named Frequent Adjacent Sequential Pattern (FASP) and Frequent Eliminated Pattern (FASPe) to represent the text using a set of sequence adjacent words or 'textual pattern' that are frequently used and eliminated across the Malay news document collection. From the discovered textual pattern, we derived some heuristic Sentence Compression Rules in generating compressed sentences to construct a single extract Malay summary. We conducted experiments on Malay news dataset and the result demonstrates that moderate compressed summary using Sentence Compression Rules has better agreement with human composed summary. © 2016 IEEE.","component;

Day traders and technical analysts rely on market sentiment, as it influences the price movement of a stock. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing approach to analyze market sentiment. In this work, we analyze the effect of the news on stock price trends on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange or Bursa Malaysia. Specifically, we analyze the financial news headlines involving one or more listed companies and determine whether it will move the stock price up, down, or flat. We propose a deep neural network architecture with name attention to model the relationship between a news headline and the stock price trend. The main idea of the approach is to focus on the target company in the headline when modeling the relationship between a headline and the stock trend using attention. The experiment result shows that the proposed approach performs better than other baseline approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Deep neural networks; Name attention; Stock price trend","Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Investments; Network architecture; Sentiment analysis; Language processing; Learning models; Name attention; Natural languages; Price movement; Price trends; Processing approach; Sentiment analysis; Stock price; Stock price trend; Deep neural networks","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme FRGS/1/2021/ICT02/USM/02/4 from Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia.","Lim S.L.O., Lim H.M., Tan E.K., Tan T.-P., Examining machine learning techniques in business news headline sentiment analysis, Alfred R, Lim Y, Haviluddin H, on C (Eds) Computational Science and Technology.

We call such sentences intra-sentential code-switch sentences. In this paper, we report on the development of a Mandarin-English code-switching spontaneous speech corpus: SEAME. The corpus is developed as part of a multilingual speech recognition project and will be used to examine how Mandarin-English codeswitch speech occurs in the spoken language in South-East Asia. Additionally, it can provide insights into the development of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) for code-switching speech. The corpus collected consists of intra-sentential code-switching utterances that are recorded under both interview and conversational settings.

In hopes of helping songwriters reach their full potential, researchers have implemented advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology to automatically generate song lyrics. These efforts, however, were met with challenges that accompany the distinctive qualities of song lyrics, such as word repetition, structural pattens, and line breaks; all of which are dependent on the music genre. Seeing as most previous research either focuses on a given approach or genre, or performs the task without consideration of lyric variation among genres, this study attempts to address the gap by exploring and comparing the capabilities of three promising methods, specifically Markov chains, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent units (GRU), in algorithmically generating lyrics for six selected music genres, namely rock, pop, country, hip-hop, electronic dance music (EDM), and rhythm and blues (R&B). Our findings show that LSTM scored better in the average readability index in overall, however, GRU produced the overall highest Rhyme Density score. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gated Recurrent Units (GRU); Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); Lyrics; Markov chains; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Text generation","Brain; Markov processes; Music; Natural language processing systems; Comparatives studies; Gated recurrent unit; Human lives; Language processing; Long short-term memory; Lyric; Music genre; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Text generations; Long short-term memory","","","","","","","Montagu J., How music and instruments began: A brief overview of the origin and entire development of music, from its earliest stages, Front.

The commonly used text representation model is Bags-of-Words (BOW) and the N-gram model. Nevertheless, some known issues of these models, which are inaccurate semantic representation of text and high dimensionality of word size combination, should be investigated. A pattern-based model named Frequent Adjacent Sequential Pattern (FASP) is introduced to represent the text using a set of sequence adjacent words that are frequently used across the document collection. The purpose of this study is to discover the similarity of textual pattern between documents that can be later converted to a set of rules to describe the main news event. The FASP is based on the Pattern-Growth’s divide-and-conquer strategy where the main difference between FASP and the prior technique is in the Pattern Generation phase. This approach is tested against the BOW and N-gram text representation model using Malay and English language news dataset with different term weightings in the Vector Space Model (VSM). The findings demonstrate that the FASP model has a promising performance in finding similarities between documents with the average vector size reduction of 34% against the BOW and 77% against the N-gram model using the Malay dataset. Results using the English dataset is also consistent, indicating that the FASP approach is also language independent. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.","Document similarity; Malay language; Pattern-Growth; Sequential Pattern Mining; Text representation","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/811295)","Acknowledgement This work is supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Research University Grant (RU) by project number 1001/PKOMP/811295.","Baharudin B., Lee L.H., Khan K., A review of machine learning algorithms for text-documents classification, J Adv Inf Technol, 1, 1, pp. 4-20, (2010); Zhang W., Yoshida T., Tang X., A comparative study of TF* IDF, LSI and multi-words for text classification, Expert Syst Appl, 38, 3, pp. 2758-2765, (2011); Lewis D.D., Text representation for intelligent text retrieval: a classification-oriented view.

A well-preserved virtual heritage does not include only the visual images of the heritage sites, but should ideally include also the audio surroundings of the heritage site that are incorporated into the virtual heritage applications as a whole. An acoustical heritage comprises the audio elements which surround the heritage sites. Psychoacoustic heritage is the extra significant psychological audio characteristic that adds to the surroundings of the heritage sites. In this paper, a randomized psychoacoustic model is proposed in 360° panoramic view on mobile platform. User interaction using multi-gesture tap is vital in delivering the psychoacoustic effects to the user. The contribution and the novelty of this research is in proposing and deploying a new psychoacoustic model mainly for the environment of 360° panoramic view in virtual heritage. In the proposed model, audio interaction design includes the changes in acoustical characteristics such as amplitude, frequency as well as the velocity within the various balanced panorama's azimuthal zones. Simulations have been carried out on a model of the Town Hall, one of the UNESCO heritage sites in George Town, Penang, Malaysia. The experimental data sets are also collected and have been found to produce promising psychoacoustic effects in panoramic view. © 2012 ACM.","acoustic modelling; acoustical heritage; amplitude; frequency; mobile virtual heritage; panoramic view; psychoacoustic","Acoustic devices; Acoustics; Interactive computer graphics; Acoustic modelling; acoustical heritage; amplitude; frequency; Panoramic views; psychoacoustic; Virtual heritage; Computer simulation","","","","","","","Carillo E., Kadobayashi R., Chikanma Shimojo S., Rodriguez-Echavarria Carillo E., Kadobayashi R., Chikanma M., Shimojo S., Rodriguez-Echavarria K., Arnold D., Making history alive and interactive: Designing an iPhone app to present the summer war of Osaka Byobu, 16th Int.

Travel narratives are among the richest sources of such spatial clues. They are also a reflection of writers’ interaction with places. One of the prevalent ways to model this interaction is a points of interest (POIs) graph depicting popular POIs and routes. A relevant notion is that frequent pairwise occurrences of POIs indicate their geographic proximity. This work presents an empirical interpretation of this theory and constructs spatially enriched POI graphs, a clear augmentation to popularity-based POI graphs. A triplet pattern, rule-based spatial relation extraction technique SpatRE is proposed and compared with standard relation extraction systems Ollie and Stanford OpenIE. A travel blogs data set is also contributed containing labelled spatial relations. The performance is further evaluated on SemEval 2013 benchmark data sets. Finally, spatially enriched POI graphs are qualitatively compared with TripAdvisor and Google Maps to visualise information accuracy. © The Author(s) 2019.","POI graphs; rule-based systems; spatial relation; travel pattern mining; travel planning","Benchmarking; Knowledge based systems; Geographic proximity; Information accuracy; POI graphs; Relation extraction; Spatial information extraction; Spatial relations; Travel pattern minings; Travel planning; Graphic methods","","","","","USM Research University, (1001/PKOMP/811335); Universiti Sains Malaysia","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The study was supported by USM Research University Grant (1001/PKOMP/811335: Mining Unstructured Web Data for Tour Itineraries Construction), Universiti Sains Malaysia.","Senaratne H., Mobasheri A., Ali A.-L., Et al., A review of volunteered geographic information quality assessment methods, Int J Geogr Inf Sci, 31, 1, pp. 139-167, (2017); Cohn A.-G., Renz J., Qualitative spatial representation and reasoning, Foundations of artificial intelligence, pp. 551-596, (2008); Skoumas G., Schmid K.-A., Josse G., Et al., Knowledge-enriched route computation, pp. 157-176, (2015); Hu Y., Geospatial semantics, Comprehensive geographic information systems, pp. 80-94, (2018); Josse G., Schmid K., Zufle A., Et al., Knowledge extraction from crowdsourced data for the enrichment of road networks, Geoinformatica, 21, 4, pp. 763-795, (2017); Yuan H., Xu H., Qian Y., Et al., Make your travel smarter: summarizing urban tourism information from massive blog data, Int J Inf Manage, 36, 6, pp. 1306-1319, (2016); Mausam S.M., Bart R., Et al., Open language learning for information extraction, pp. 523-534; Angeli G., Premkumar M.J., Manning C.D., Leveraging linguistic structure for open domain information extraction; Haris E., Gan K.H., Kuala Lumpur travel blogs dataset, v1, (2018); Kolomiyets O., Kordjamshidi P., Bethard S., Et al., Semeval- 2013 task 2: spatial role labeling; Haris E., Gan K.H., Mining graphs from travel blogs: A review in the context of tour planning, Inf Technol Tour, 17, 4, pp. 429-453, (2017); Puhringer S., Taylor A., A practitioner’s report on blogs as potential sources for destination marketing intelligence, J Vacat Mark, 14, 2, pp. 177-187, (2008); Nanba H., Taguma H., Ozaki T., Et al., Automatic compilation of travel information from automatically identified travel blogs, pp. 205-208; Wu M.-Y., Pearce P.L., Tourism blogging motivations: why do Chinese tourists create little ‘Lonely Planets’?, J Travel Res, 55, 4, pp. 537-549, (2016); Kori H., Hattori S., Tezuka T., Et al., Automatic generation of multimedia tour guide from local blogs, pp. 690-699; Yuan H., Guo L., Xu H., Et al., Frequent patterns-based word network: what can we obtain from the tourism blogs?, pp. 15-26, (2013); Xu H., Yuan H., Ma B., Et al., Where to go and what to play: Towards summarizing popular information from massive tourism blogs, J Inf Sci, 41, 6, pp. 830-854, (2015); Guo L., Li Z., Sun W., Understanding travel destinations from structured tourism blogs; Drymonas E., Pfoser D., Geospatial route extraction from texts, pp. 209-237; Kim J., Vasardani M., Winter S., Harvesting large corpora for generating place graphs, (2015); Kim J., Vasardani M., Winter S., Landmark extraction from web-harvested place descriptions, KI, 31, 2, pp. 151-159, (2017); Liu F., Vasardani M., Baldwin T., Automatic identification of locative expressions from social media text: a comparative analysis, pp. 9-16; Skoumas G., Pfoser D., Kyrillidis A., Et al., Location estimation using crowdsourced spatial relations, ACM Trans Spat Algorithms Syst, 2, 2, (2016); Yahi A., Chassang A., Raynaud L., Et al., Aurigo: an interactive tour planner for personalized itineraries, pp. 275-285; Haris E., Gan K.H., Framework of blog data based multi-criteria weighted points of interest graph for trip planning, Intell Decis Technol, 12, 1, pp. 1-10, (2018); Fournier-Viger P., Lin C.-W., Gomariz A., Et al., The SPMF open-source data mining library version 2, pp. 36-40; O'Donnell M., Demonstration of the UAM corpus tool for text and image annotation, pp. 13-16; Schneider R., Oberhauser T., Klatt T., Et al., Analysing errors of open information extraction systems, pp. 11-18; Khan A., Vasardani M., Winter S., Extracting spatial information from place descriptions, pp. 62-69","E.

In contrast to weighted least square and eigenvoices methods, manual interpolation can be achieved offline without any adaptation data. These methods can also be combined with MLLR to improve the recognition rate. Experiments presented in this paper show that the best non native adaptation method, combined with MLLR can give 10% WER absolute reduction on a French automatic speech recognition system for both Chinese and Vietnamese native speakers. © 2007 IEEE.","Adaptation; Interpolation; Non-native ASR","Acoustic properties; Automation; Constraint theory; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Interpolation; Least squares approximations; Acoustic model interpolation; Adaptation method; Automatic speech recognition; Non-native speech recognition; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Witt S., Use of Speech Recognition in Computer Assisted Language Learning, (1999); Goronzy S., Robust Adaptation to Non-Native Accents in Automatic Speech Recognition, (2002); Wang Z., Schultz T., Non-Native Spontaneous Speech Recognition through Polyphone Decision Tree Specialization, Proc Eurospeech-03, pp. 1449-1452, (2003); Flege J., The Production of 'New' and 'Similar' Phones in a Foreign Language: Evidence for the Effect of Equivalence Classification, Journal of Phonetics, 15, pp. 47-65, (1987); Juang B.H., Rabiner L.R., A Probabilistic Distance Measure for Hidden Markov Models, AT&T Technical Journal, 64, 2, pp. 391-408, (1985); Humpries J.J., Woodland P., The Use of Accent-Specific Pronunciation Dictionaries in Acoustic Model Training, ICASSP-98, 1, pp. 317-320, (1998); Montgomery D.C., Peck E.A., Geoffrey Vining G., Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis, (2001); Kuhn R., Nguyen P., Goldwasser L., Niedzielski N., Fincke S., Contolini M., Eigenvoices for Speaker Adaptation, ICSLP 98, pp. 1774-1777, (1998); Nguyen P., Fast Speaker Adaptation; Westwood R.J., Speaker Adaptation Using Eigen voices, (1999); Tan T.P., Besacier L., A French Non-Native Corpus for Automatic Speech Recognition, LREC 2006, pp. 1610-1613, (2006); Lamel L.F., Gauvain J.L., M.

A summary can serve as a condensed version of a text, where salient information can be presented. In order to improve a summary’s quality, a special task in the area of Automatic Text Summarization known as Sentence Compression (SC) can be applied. Existing SC techniques are highly dependent on syntactic knowledge applied on individual word or phrases to decide on the compressions decision. In contrast, this study introduces a new constrained Pattern-Growth SC (PGSC) technique inspired by the “divide and conquer” strategy tailored to the Malay language. The basic idea is to divide the sentences into segments where unimportant segments are removed while the important ones are conquered iteratively. Using a Malay news dataset, the application of PGSC have shown promising results where the compressed summaries reported an F-Measure score of 0.5752 agreements when evaluated against manual human summaries and perform better than the Baselines (uncompressed) model. Manual human evaluation produced readability score of 4.31 out of 5 and 4.1 for content responsiveness, suggesting a better quality and readability of the compressed summaries produced by the MYTextSum model. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Malay; Sentence Compression; Sequential Pattern-Growth; Text Summarization","Compaction; Iterative methods; Quality control; Text processing; Automatic text summarization; Divide and conquer; F-measure scores; Human evaluation; Malay; Sentence compression; Sequential patterns; Text summarization; Tellurium compounds","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia University; Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (1001/PKOMP/811295)","Funding text 1: This work is supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Research University Grant (RU) by project number 1001/PKOMP/811295.; Funding text 2: Acknowledgement.

We explore an SBI improvement method using latent semantic analysis (LSA) with noun unification. The proposed system uses the phonetic forms of words (pronunciation forms) to identify story boundaries based on noun unification and edit distance to estimate the cost of edit operations for nouns and to compare this cost with a predetermined threshold generated by a training dataset. SBI commonly uses latent semantic analysis for its excellent performance and because it is based on deep semantics rather than shallow principles. In this study, the LSA algorithm with and without unification was used to identify the boundaries of Malay spoken broadcast news stories. The LSA algorithm with the noun unification approach resulted in less errors and better performance than the LSA algorithm without noun unification. The preliminary results of the current work for SBI using LSA with noun unification are encouraging compared with the common LSA with the general approach for selecting bag-of-words. © Technomathematics Research Foundation.","Automatic speech recognition; Latent semantic analysis; Story boundaries identification; Word pronunciation","Semantics; Speech recognition; Automatic speech recognition; Better performance; Boundary identification; Improvement methods; Latent Semantic Analysis; News broadcasts; Training dataset; Word pronunciation; Cost benefit analysis","","","","","","","Alabbas M., Khalaf Z.A., Khashan K.M., BASRAH: an automatic system to identify the meter of Arabic poetry, pp. 1-19, (2012); Banerjee S., Rudnicky A.I., A TextTiling based approach to topic boundary detection in meetings, (2006); Blei D.M.A.M., Topic segmentation with an aspect hidden markov model, Proceedings of the 24th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval, (2001); Chan S.K., Xie L., Modeling the statistical behavior of lexical chains to capture word cohesiveness for automatic story segmentation, (2007); Choi F.Y.Y., Advances in domain independent linear text segmentation, Proceedings of the 1st North American chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics conference, (2000); Choi F.Y.Y., Wiemer-Hastings P., Moore J., Latent semantic analysis for text segmentation, Proceedings of EMNLP, (2001); Diao H., Bai Z., Yu X., The Application of Improved K-Nearest Neighbor Classification in Topic Tracking, IEEE, (2010); Eisenstein J., Hierarchical text segmentation from multi-scale lexical cohesion, Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics., (2009); Fragkou P., Petridis V., Kehagias A., A Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Linear Text Segmentation, Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 23, 2, pp. 179-197, (2004); Galina A.A., English Vowel Sounds, (2007); Galley M., Mckeown K., Fosler-Lussier E., Jing H., Discourse segmentation of multi-party conversation, Proceedings of the 41st Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, (2003); Geiss J., Latent semantic sentence clustering for multi-document summarization, (2011); Hearst M.A., TextTiling: Segmenting text into multi-paragraph subtopic passages, Computational linguistics, 23, pp. 33-64, (1997); Jain A.K., Data Clustering: 50 Years Beyond K-Means1, Pattern Recognition Letters, 31, pp. 651-666, (2010); Jerome R., Bellegarda A., Latent semantic mapping, IEEE signal processing magazine, 5, pp. 70-80, (2005); Khalaf Z.A., Alabbas M., Ping T.T., BASRAH: Arabic Verses Meters Identification System, IALP, 2011 Year, Penang-Malaysia.

The proposed method consists of two phases: phones adaptation and pronunciation generalization. In the first phase of phones adaptation, we identify the English phonemes used by Malaysian speakers by carrying out perception test, and then the mismatch due to the influenced of the speaker's mother tongue is removed. The second phase of the proposed approach is pronunciation generalization. In this phase, the hypothesis is that non-native speakers generalized the pronunciation of syllable in different contexts and words by applying the same pronunciations. The proposed approach has improved the performance of the automatic speech recognition.

G2P is an important module in a speech synthesis system and an automatic speech recognition system. Two main G2P approaches are: knowledge-based and data-driven. The knowledge based G2P is built based on linguist knowledge. The data-driven approach such as the statistical approach on the other hand does not need expert knowledge, but it requires data to learn the rules. In this research, we propose an approach that combines linguistic knowledge into a statistical-based G2P convertor for Khmer. We examined a simple way of adding linguistic knowledge into the statistical G2P convertor by simply inserting vowel tags into a Khmer word. Three types of vowel tags were used. The main strength of this approach is it combines the strength of linguistic knowledge and statistical-based approach, to build a robust G2P model. The information allows better modeling and prediction of the phoneme sequence, thus improving the phoneme error rate (PER) and word error rate (WER). The PER and WER of our proposed Khmer G2P improve from 23.2% and 69.6% to 11.1% and 51.4% respectively. © 2019 The Authors.","Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P); Khmer; Rule-based G2P; Statistical G2P","Information use; Knowledge based systems; Speech recognition; Speech synthesis; Statistics; Automatic speech recognition system; Grapheme to phonemes; Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion; Khmer; Modeling and predictions; Rule based; Speech synthesis system; Statistical G2P; Linguistics","","","","","","","Thu Y.K., Pa W.P., Sagisaka Y., Iwahashi N., Comparison of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion methods on a Myanmar pronunciation dictionary, Proceedings of WSSANLP, pp. 11-22, (2016); Seng S., Sam S., Le V.-B., Bigi B., Besacier L., Which units for acoustic and language modeling for Khmer automatic speech recognition?, SLTU 2008, (2008); Annanda Th.R., Meng L.S., Heng S., Nipaul L., Heng S.K., Complexity of Letter to Sound Conversion (LTS) in Khmer Language: Under the Context of Khmer Text-to-Speech (TTS), (2007); Soky K., Lu X., Shen P., Kato H., Kawai H., Vanna C., Chea V., Building WFST based Grapheme to Phoneme Conversion for Khmer, Proceedings of KNLP2016, (2016); Sok M., Adam L., Phonological principles and automatic phonemic and phonetic transcription of Khmer words, Proceedings of PACLIC30, pp. 417-424, (2016); Sarma P., Sarma S.K., A study on rule based approach for grapheme to phoneme conversion of assamese letters in festival framework, Proceedings of ICADW, pp. 173-176, (2016); Tan T.-P., Ranaivo-Malancon B., Malay grapheme-to-phoneme tool for automatic speech recognition, Proceedings of Malindo'09, (2009); Divay M., Guyomard M., Grapheme-to-phoneme Transcription for French, Proceedings of ICASSP'77, pp. 575-578, (1977); Lee J., GeunbaeLee G., A data-driven grapheme-to-phoneme conversion method using dynamic contextual converting rules for Korean TTS systems, Computer Speech & Language, 23, 4, pp. 423-434, (2009); Juan S.F., Besacier L., Fast bootstrapping of grapheme to phoneme system for under-resourced languages-application to the Iban language, Proceedings of WSSANLP, pp. 1-8, (2013); Novak J.R., Minematsu N., Hirose K., WFST-based grapheme-to-phoneme conversion: Open Source tools for Alignment, Model-Building and Decoding, Proceedings of FSMNLP, pp. 45-49, (2012); Chuon N., Khmer-Khmer Dictionary, (1967); Chea V., Thu Y.K., Ding C., Utiyama M., Finch A., Sumita E., Khmer word segmentation using conditional random fields, Proceedings of KNLP, (2015); Stolcke A., Zheng J., Wang W., Abrash V., SRILM at sixteen: Update and outlook, Proceedings of ASRU2011, (2011)","T.-P.

The interest in sentiment analysis has been rising due to the availability of a large amount of sentiment corpus and the enormous potential of sentiment analysis applications. This work attempts to evaluate different machine learning techniques in predicting the sentiment of the readers toward business news headlines. News articles report events that have happened in the world and expert opinions. These are factors that will affect market sentiment, and a headline can be considered as a summary of an article in a single sentence. In this study, we constructed a sentiment analysis corpus which consists of business news headlines. We examined two different approaches, namely text classification and recurrent neural network (RNN) in predicting the sentiment of a business news headline. For text classification approach, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier, multinomial naïve Bayes, complement naïve Bayes and decision trees were experimented. On the other hand, for the RNN approach, we evaluated the typical RNN architecture and the encoder-decoder architecture in predicting the sentiment. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","business/finance news; recurrent neural networks; sentimental analysis; text classification","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Linguistics; Machine learning; Network architecture; Sentiment analysis; Encoder-decoder architecture; Expert opinion; Machine learning techniques; Multi layer perceptron; NAtural language processing; Recurrent neural network (RNN); sentimental analysis; Text classification; Recurrent neural networks","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304)","This work is funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia through the Bridging grant scheme 304.PKOMP.6316283.","Kusen E., Strembeck M., Politics, sentiments, and misinformation: An analysis of the Twitter discussion on the 2016 Austrian Presidential Elections, Online Social Networks and Media, 5, pp. 37-50, (2018); Miranda M.D., Jose Sassi R., Using sentiment analysis to assess customer satisfaction in an online job search company, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 183, pp. 17-27; Kaushik A., Kaushik A., Naithani S., A Study on Sentiment Analysis: Methods and Tools, International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), 4, pp. 287-292, (2015); Kiritchenko S., Zhu X., Cherry C., Mohammad S.M., Detecting aspects and sentiment in customer reviews, 8Th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (Semeval), pp. 437-442, (2014); Alharbi M., M A., de Doncker E., Twitter sentiment analysis with a deep neural network: An enhanced approach using user behavioural information, Cognitive Systems Research, 54, pp. 50-61, (2019); Zhang L., Wang S., Liu B., Deep learning for sentiment analysis: A survey, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, (2018); Godbole N., Srinivasaiah M., Skiena S., Large-scale sentiment analysis for news and blogs.
