Penang, 11800, Malaysia","Due to the enormous improvement in networking and multimedia, IPTV has become recently a popular means to distribute high quality TV services over IP networks. Accordingly, Telecommunication companies started the competition to provide IPTV services to increase their customer base and profit. The key concern of service providers in this hectic competition is to provide high quality service with lower cost. However, the contents’ popularity and the users’ preferences are fluctuated rapidly, which leads to resources waste and load imbalance. Thus, the contents’ status should be considered during the content replication to save resources and reduce service cost. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work investigate the impact of contents’ status on building Replica Placement Strategy. Therefore, this paper studies the impact of contents’ status on replica placement strategy over the peer-service area architecture. Two optimization models are proposed Cost Effective Model (CE), which replicates the contents partially without considering contents’ status and Cost Effective with Load Balance model (CELB), which considers the contents’ status. Both models have been solved using Hybrid Genetic Algorithm. The experimental results show that CELB model outperforms the other models in terms of Storage Saving Ratio (SSR), load distribution, and allocation cost. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Content status; Heuristic repair algorithm; Hybrid genetic algorithm; IPTV delivery networks; Load balancing; Replica placement","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Genetic algorithms; Multimedia services; Network architecture; Network management; Optimization; Resource allocation; Telecommunication services; Television broadcasting; Content status; High quality service; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Optimization models; Repair algorithms; Replica placement; Replica placement strategies; Telecommunication companies; IPTV","","","","","","","Almeida J.M., Streaming content distribution networks with minimum delivery cost, Ph.D, University of Wisconsin, (2003); Bektas T., Cordeau J., Erkut E., Laporte G., Exact algorithms for the joint object placement and request routing problem in content distribution networks, J Comput Opera Res, 35, 12, pp. 3860-3884, (2008); Bisdikian C.C., Patel B.B., Cost-based program allocation for distributed multimedia-on-demand systems, IEEE Multimed, 3, 3, pp. 62-72, (1996); Bolosky W.J., Barrera J.S., Draves R.P., Fitzgerald R.P., Gibson G.A., Jones M.B., Levi S.P., Myhrvold N.P., Rashid R.F., The tiger video fileserver.

Traditionally, we need to manually identify and label all the fruits in the production line, which is labor intensive, error-prone, and ineffective. Therefore, a lot of fruit recognition systems are created to automate the process, but fruit recognition system for Malaysia local fruit is limited. Thus, this project will focus on classifying one of the Malaysia local fruits which is markisa/passion fruit. We proposed two CNN models for markisa classification. The performances of the proposed models are evaluated on our own dataset collection and produces an accuracy of 97% and 65% respectively. The results indicated that the architecture of CNN model is very important because different architecture can produce different results. Therefore, first CNN model is selected because it can classify 4 types of markisa with a higher accuracy. In the proposed work, we also inspected two transfer learning methods in the classification of markisa which are VGG-16 and InceptionV3. The results showed that the performance of the first proposed CNN model outperforms VGG-16 (95% accuracy) and InceptionV3 (65% accuracy). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Convolutional neural network;

However, it has two characteristics namely: 1) Out-place updating and 2) Cleaning process that affects its performance as an efficient storage sub-system. Both characteristics influence the access time requirement in enabling the continuity of data storing and updating. In this paper, we propose an efficient data allocation scheme that takes into account the data popularity as the main indicator in making the allocation decision. Then, we unveil the importance of the allocation scheme in the block cleaning algorithm process. The simulation studies have shown that the integration between the block cleaning algorithm and the proposed data allocation scheme has significant impact on the cleaning process performance in terms of the number of block erasure operation and the number of active block requirements. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Algorithm; Allocation; Cleaning; Flash memory; Simulation","Algorithms; Flash memory; Virtual storage; Access time; Active blocks; Allocation; Allocation decision; Block cleaning; Cleaning process; Data allocation; Data popularity; Data storing; Memory performance; Non-volatile; Number of blocks; Significant impacts; Simulation; Simulation studies; Sub-systems; Cleaning","","","","","","","Chang L., Kuo T., An efficient management scheme for large-scale flash-memory storage systems, Proceedings of the 2004 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing; Breeuwsma M., Jongh M.D., Klaver C., Knijff R.V.D., Roeloffs M., Forensic data recovery from flash memory, Journal of Small Scale Digital Device Forensics, 1, pp. 1-17, (2007); Lawton G., Improved flash memory grows in popularity, Computer, 39, pp. 16-18, (2006); Douglis F., Caceres R., Kaashoek F., Li K., Marsh B., Tauber J.A., Storage alternatives for mobile computers,  Symp.

Early detection is the key for improving breast cancer prognosis. Mammography has been one of the most reliable methods for early detection of breast carcinomas. However, it is difficult for radiologists to provide both accurate and uniform evaluation for the enormous mammograms generated in widespread screening. The main objective of this paper is to enhance, detect and classify masses in digital mammogram. We develop a performance based case-based reasoning classification algorithm for mammographic findings to provide support for the clinical decision to perform biopsy of the breast. The developed classifier will be used for training and testing the images which is cancerous and noncancerous and improve the performance of the system. ©2010 IEEE.","Case base; Feature extarction; Mammogram; Segmentation","Diagnosis; Mammography; X ray screens; Breast Cancer; Breast carcinomas; Case base; CBr; Classification algorithm; Clinical decision; Digital mammograms; Early detection; Feature extarction; Machine-learning; Mammogram; Mammographic; Mass detection; Performance based; Problem Solving methods; Public health; Segmentation; Training and testing; Case based reasoning","","","","","","","Fajardo L.J., Williams M.B., The Clinical Potential of Digital Mammography, Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Digital Mammography, pp. 43-52, (1996); Vyborny C.J., Giger M.L., Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence in Mammography, American Journal of Roentgenology, 162, pp. 699-708, (1994); Zhang W., Et al., An improved shift-invariant artificial neural network for computerized detection of clustered microcalcifications in digital mammograms, Medical Physics, 23, pp. 595-601, (1996); Petrick N., Et al., Combined adaptive enhancement and region growing segmentation of breast masses on digitized mammograms, Medical Physics, 26, pp. 1642-1654, (1999); Lai S.M., Li X., Bischof W.F., On techniques for detecting circumscribed masses in mammograms, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 8, pp. 377-386, (1989); Lopez De Mantaras R., Mcsherry D., Et al., Retrieval, reuse, revision, and retention in case based reasoning, The Knowledge Engineering Review, 1-2, (2005); Bottigli U., Cascio D., Fauci F., Golosio B., Magro R., Masala G.L., Oliva P., Raso G., Stumbo S., Massive Lesions Classification using Features based on Morphological Lesion Differences, Proceedings of World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 12, (2006); Brzakovic D., Et al., An approach to automated detection of tumors in mammograms, Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on, 9, pp. 233-241, (1990); Valliappan R., Sumari P., Digital Mammogram Segmentation: An Initial Stage, 4th IASTED International Conference on Advanced Computing Science and Technology, Langawi, Malaysia, 2008","V.

Cyberstalking detection has become increasingly popular in recent years and has technically been investigated by many researchers. However, cyberstalking victimization, an essential part of cyberstalking, has empirically received less attention from the paper community. This paper attempts to address this gap and develop a model to understand and estimate the prevalence of cyberstalking victimization. The model of this paper is produced using routine activities and lifestyle exposure theories and includes eight hypotheses. The data of this paper is collected from the 757 respondents in Jordanian universities. This review paper utilizes a quantitative approach and uses structural equation modeling for data analysis. The results revealed a modest prevalence range is more dependent on the cyberstalking type. The results also indicated that proximity to motivated offenders, suitable targets, and digital guardians significantly influences cyberstalking victimization. The outcome from moderation hypothesis testing demonstrated that age and residence have a significant effect on cyberstalking victimization. The proposed model is an essential element for assessing cyberstalking victimization among societies, which provides a valuable understanding of the prevalence of cyberstalking victimization. This can assist the researchers and practitioners for future research in the context of cyberstalking victimization. © 2021 by the authors.

It is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, after lung cancer. Screening mammography is currently the most effective tool for early detection of breast cancer. For every thousand cases analyzed by a radiologist, only 3 to 4 are cancerous and the rest could be overlooked. The challenges basically come from the (1) A large variability in the appearance of abnormalities (masses) within digital mammogram made very difficult in image analysis (2) Presence of high dense breast tissues for fibroglandular tissue predominance such as mammogram of young woman which makes the distinction between normal glandular tissues and malignant disease is difficult, So it is very hard to detect the masses with an opaque uniform background and (3) hard to obtain data in an unstructured knowledge of previous screening history. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm by CBR (Case Based Reasoning Classification) based computerized mammogram mass detection for improving the accuracy rate of detection; the main aim of the paper is to show the evaluation results of CBR classification and make a comparative analysis with existing ANN classification method. © 2012 AICIT.","Case Base Reasoning and Aritificial Neural Network; Classification; Segmentation","Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Diseases; Histology; Image segmentation; Information management; Mammography; Tissue; X ray screens; Accuracy rate; ANN classification; Breast Cancer; Breast tissues; Case-base reasonings; CBr; Comparative analysis; Digital mammograms; Early detection of breast cancer; Effective tool; Evaluation results; Fibroglandular tissue; Glandular tissue; Lung Cancer; Malaysia; Malignant disease; Mass detection; Skin cancers; Case based reasoning","","","","","","","Fajardo L.J., Williams M.B., The Clinical Potential of Digital Mammography, Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Digital Mammography, Chicago, USA, pp. 43-52, (1996); Bottigli U., Et al., Massive Lesions Classification using Features based on Morphological Lesion Differences, Proceedings of World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, Greece, 12, (2006); Wang C.-M., Et al., Classification for Breast MRI Using Support Vector Machine, 1nternational Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 9, 5, (2009); Vibha L., Harshavardhan G.M., LESION DETECTION USING SEGMENTATION and CLASSIFICATION of MAMMOGRAMS, Proceedings of 25th IASTED Conference on AI and Its Applications"", Austria, Feb 2007; Rabottino G., Et al., Mass Contour Extraction in Mammographic Images for Breast Cancer Identification, 16th IMEKO TC4 Symposium,Exploring New Frontiers of Instrumentation and Methods for Electrical and Electronic Measurements,Italy, Sep 2008; Valliappan R., Sumari P., Mohan V., Then P., Case Base Classification on Mammograms: Adding Weights and Improving the Performance of CBR Classifier, IEEE ICGIP,Manila, Philippines,Dec 2010; Bishop C.M., Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition, (1996); Battiti R., First and second order methods for learning:between steepest descent and Newton's method, Journal of Neural Computing, 4, (1992)","V.

Virtual delivery networks, as a cost-effective alternative, tend to be the dominant delivery option in the near future due to its advantages for service providers. However, virtual networks provisioning is more complicated as it integrates resources allocation, resources diminishing, and content replication interdependently. In this paper, we investigate the problem of virtual IPTV delivery network provisioning over the recent architecture, peer-service area architecture. The Genetic Algorithm as an optimization tool has been used to find the optimal provisioning parameters including storage, bandwidth, and CPU consumption. The experiments have been conducted on two data sets with different popularity distributions. The experimental results showed the impact of content popularity on the provisioning process Copyright 2014 ACM.","Content popularity; Hybrid genetic algorithm; IPTV; VDN provisioning; Virtual delivery networks","Communication; Genetic algorithms; Information management; IPTV; Optimization; Content popularities; Content replication; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Network provisioning; Optimal provisioning; Popularity distribution; Resources allocation; VDN provisioning; Network architecture","","","","","","","Nguyen H.V., Safaei F., Boustead P., Chou C.T., Provisioning overlay distribution networks, Comput.

It has lots of attractive features such as small size and light weight nature, zero noise, solid-state reliability, low power consumption, and better shock resistant. However, its two hardware characteristics, namely, i) out-place updating and ii) garbage collection process are affecting flash memory performance if these characteristics are not well-organized. To overcome these constraints, we propose an efficient page allocation scheme that based on the occurrences of page data in the data access pattern. In the scheme, we have classified the page data into hot and cold data and allocated them into different blocks. The performance of the allocation scheme is confirmed by trace-driven simulations and the merit of the proposed scheme is justified in terms of a number of active block requirements. The number of active block requirement is reduced into 16% in comparison to the existing schemes. ©2009 IEEE.","Active block; Flash memory; Garbage collection; Trace-driven simulation","Refuse collection; Waste disposal; Active blocks; Consumer devices; Data access patterns; Data allocation; Data storage devices; Garbage collection; Hardware characteristics; Light weight; Low-power consumption; Page allocation; Small size; Trace driven simulation; Flash memory","","","","","","","Douglis F., Caceres R., Kaashoek F., Li K., Marsh B., Tauber J.A., Storage alternatives for mobile computers,  Symp.

Approaches to OWM must be matched to the characteristics of a certain population. In this consideration, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is no exception. Organizations are being aligned to focus on sustainability matters sharing significant features with universal trends, especially the integration of 3Rs (reducing waste, reusing, and recycling resources). However, the degree and nature of advancement in the direction of sustainability vary depending on the economic level of a state. High-income economies can afford to pay a higher price to integrate 3Rs technologies. Most recent endeavors have focused on achieving ‘Zero Waste’, which is costly for low-income developing countries. The expectations of OWM systems in KSA must be estimated. In this work, the situations in KSA and other countries are analyzed, and pertinent aspects are explored. Matters relating to the sustainability of OWM are conceptually assessed. This study proposes an integrated method for an organic waste management system to achieve sustainable OWM in the context of state policy and appropriate frameworks, suitable technology, institutional order, operational and monetary administration, and people consciousness and involvement. A genetic-based waste collection transportation algorithm that enhances the efficiency of waste collection truck management is presented in line with this technology. The selected routes based on the Rfs and IPv are the most efficient among those available for the examined smart bin destinations. The minimum Rfs of selected routes is less than the maximum Rfs of available routes by 2.63%. Also, the minimum IPv of selected routes is less than the maximum IPv of available routes by 27.08%. The proposed integrated approach, including the waste collection transportation algorithm, would be beneficial across a variety of country-specific layouts. © 2022 by the authors.

This paper demonstrates how the incorporation of the Internet of Things (IoT) with data access networks, geographic information systems and combinatorial optimization can contribute to enhancing cities’ administration systems. A waste-gathering approach based on supplying smart bins is introduced by using an IoT prototype embedded with sensors, which can read and convey bin volume data over the Internet. However, from another perspective, the population and residents’ attitudes directly affect the control of the waste management system. The conventional waste collection system does not cover all areas in the city. It works based on a planned scheme that is implemented by the authorized organization focused on specific popular and formal areas. The conventional system cannot observe a real-time update of the bin status to recognize whether the waste level condition is ‘full,’ ‘not full,’ or ‘empty.’ This paper uses IoT in the container and trucks that secure the overflow and separation of waste. Waste source locations and population density influence the volume of waste generation, especially waste food, as it has the highest amount of waste generation. The open public area and the small space location problems are solved by proposing different truck sizes based on the waste type. Each container is used for one type of waste, such as food, plastic and others, and uses the optimization algorithm to calculate and find the optimal route toward the full waste container. In this work, the situations in KSA are evaluated, and relevant aspects are explored. Issues relating to the sustainability of organic waste management are conceptually analyzed. A genetic-based optimization algorithm for waste collection transportation enhances the performance of waste-gathering truck management. The selected routes based on the volume status and free spaces of the smart bins are the most effective through those obtainable towards the urgent smart bin targets. The proposed system outperforms other systems by reducing the number of locations and smart bins that have to be visited by 46% for all waste types, whereas the conventional and existing systems have to visit all locations every day, resulting in high cost and consumption time. © 2022 by the authors.","environmental logistics; IoT; public area; smart city; smart infrastructure; urban","Cities; Geographic Information Systems; Plastics; Recycling; Waste Management; Makkah [Saudi Arabia]; Mecca; Saudi Arabia; plastic; algorithm; GIS; Internet; optimization; public space; sensor; smart city; trucking; waste management; algorithm; Article; attitude to computers; data processing; geographic information system; internet of things; organic waste; population density; process optimization; Saudi Arabia; urban area; waste management; city; procedures; recycling","","Plastics, ","","","University of Hail, UOH, (RG-20 044)","Funding text 1: This research has been funded by the Scientific Research Deanship at the University of Ha’il, Saudi Arabia, through project number RG-20 044.; Funding text 2: We would like to acknowledge the Scientific Research Deanship at the University of Ha’il, Saudi Arabia, for funding this research.

It is also robust against Image processing attacks such as low pass filtering (LPF), Median filtering, and Weiner filtering. Furthermore, the algorithm is robust against Noise attacks such as Gaussian noise, Salt and Pepper attacks. The embedded data rate is high and robust. The experimental results show that the embedded watermark is robust and invisible.

The Big Brain Data Initiative project was started by Universiti Sains Malaysia as the first neuroimaging data repository platform in Malaysia for the purpose of data sharing. In order to ensure that the neuroimaging data in this project is accessible, usable, and secure, as well as to offer users high-quality data that can be consistently accessed, we first came up with good data stewardship practices. Then, we developed MyneuroDB, an online repository database system for data sharing purposes.

One of the applications of these systems is P300 speller. This application provides the ability to spell the characters on the screen for disabled people. In this study, we review the character recognition and its relation to P300 detection. Then, we used three neural networks models with flexible activation functions to detect P300 patterns from electroencephalographic signals more accurately. The obtained results have shown the accuracy of the character recognition based on the precision and recall measures. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","","Brain computer interface; Character recognition; Computer networks; Electroencephalography; Handicapped persons; Interactive computer systems; Neural networks; Disabled people; Electroencephalographic signals; Flexible activation functions; Human brain; Neural networks model; Precision and recall; Signal detection","","","","","","","Allison B.Z., Wolpaw E.W., Wolpaw J.R., Brain-computer interface systems: Progress and prospects, Expert Review of Medical Devices, 4, 4, pp. 463-474, (2007); Birbaumer N., Cohen L.G., Brain-computer interfaces: Communication and restoration of movement in paralysis, Physiology London, 579, 3, pp. 621-636, (2007); Kostov A., Polak M., Parallel man-machine training in development of EEG-based cursor control, IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering, 8, 2, pp. 203-205, (2000); Niedermeyer E., Lopes D.

This fruit is classified into tens of different cultivars based on fruit, flesh, and tree features. In this project, five different rambutan cultivars classification models using deep learning techniques were developed based on a 1000 rambutan images dataset. Common deep learning methods for the image classification task, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and transfer learning method were applied to recognize each rambutan variant. Results have shown that the VGG16 pre-trained model performed best as it achieved 96% accuracy on the test dataset. This indicates the model is reliable for the rambutan classification task. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning;

This innovative approach overcomes the limitations associated with camera-based sensors, such as increased manufacturing costs and shape restrictions, enabling potential integration as a skin-like layer over a robot's body. Our proposed direct light propagation structure demonstrates enhanced sensitivity and a broader measuring range compared to traditional reflection structures. Using Ecoflex as the elastomer, the sensor's design incorporates a three-layer structure, including an LED layer, an elastomer layer, and a color sensor layer. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed sensor performs well in localization tasks, achieving over 95% accuracy using multi-target regression for rendering poked positions. This study demonstrates the potential of single-pixel-based tactile sensors in various applications and provides a foundation for further exploration in this area. © 2023 IEEE.","Optical Tactile Sensor; Single-Pixel; Tactile Sensing","Elastomers; Pixels; Camera based Sensors; Color light; Design and Development; Innovative approaches; Optical tactile sensor; Optical-; Pixel color; Single pixel; Tactile sensing; Tactile sensors; Tactile sensors","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62203428); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M703389); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JSGGZD20220822095401004, RCBS20210706092252054); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515110486)","The work described in this paper is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation for Youth of China under grant No. 62203428, in part by Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China under grant No. 2021M703389, in part by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation under grant No. 2021A1515110486, in part by the Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen under grant No. JSGGZD20220822095401004, and in part by the Shenzhen Science and Technology Program under grant No. RCBS20210706092252054.","Fang S., Yi Z., Mi T., Zhou Z., Ye C., Shang W., Xu T., Wu X., Tactonet: Tactile ordinal network based on unimodal probability for object hardness classification, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, (2022); Yi Z., Calandra R., Veiga F., Van Hoof H., Hermans T., Zhang Y., Peters J., Active tactile object exploration with Gaussian processes, 2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).

This exploration is achieved utilizing a group of robots in an obstacle cluttered environment and distributing tasks amongst these robot(s). The robotic configuration is equipped with sensors to acquire data from the surroundings and to ensure collision-free motion. This paper presents a framework for the design of a Hybrid Stochastic Optimizer (HSO) for multi-robot space exploration. The proposed algorithm augments deterministic Coordinated Multi-Robot Exploration (CME) and stochastic Arithmetic Optimization (AO) techniques for maximizing the utility. The framework initially utilizes deterministic CME to ascertain the cost and utility values of adjacent cells around robot(s). The overall solution accuracy is then improved utilizing the Arithmetic Optimization algorithm. The proposed utilization of hybrid is interpreted that the algorithm starts with deterministic technique and continues off with stochastic method until the required improved solution with the desired accuracy is achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed Hybrid Stochastic Optimizer is ascertained by training the multi-robotic framework in various complexity maps. The results efficacy is then demonstrated by comparing the results of the HSO algorithm with those achieved from two contemporary techniques namely conventional CME and hybrid CME with whale optimizer. Results demonstrate that the proposed HSO algorithm significantly improved the exploration parameters by enhancing the explored area and reducing the search time.  © 2013 IEEE.","CME; hybridization; meta-heuristic; Multi robotic; whale optimizer","Industrial robots; Machine design; Multipurpose robots; Optimization; Robotics; Space research; Stochastic systems; Cluttered environments; Contemporary techniques; Deterministic technique; Multi-robot exploration; Optimization algorithms; Space explorations; Stochastic arithmetic; Stochastic methods; Educational robots","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work was supported by the Universtiti Sains Malaysia.","Xiao-Hua S., Chun-Ming Y., Application of bat algorithm to permutation -ow-shop scheduling problem, Ind.

Automatic detection of grocery on the shelf of retail store provides enhanced value-added to consumer experience, commercial benefits to retailers and efficient monitoring to domestic enforcement ministry. Compared to machine vision-based object recognition system, automatic detection of retail grocery in a store setting has lesser number of successful attempts. In this paper, we present an enhanced YOLOv4 for grocery detection and recognition. We enhanced through spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and Intersection over union (IOU) components of YOLOv4 to be more accurate in making recognition and faster in the process. We carried an experiment using modified YOLOv4 algorithm to work with our new customized annotated dataset consist on 12000 images with 13 classes. The experiment result shows satisfactory detection compare to other similar works with mAP of 79.39, IoU threshold of 50%, accuracy of 82.83% and real time performance of 61 frames per second. © 2022 Little Lion Scientific.

Early detection is the key for improving breast cancer prognosis. Mammography has been one of the most reliable methods for early detection of breast carcinomas. However, it is difficult for radiologists to provide both accurate and uniform evaluation for the enormous mammograms generated in widespread screening. The CAD systems can provide such help and they are important and necessary for breast cancer control. Microcalcifications and masses are the two most important indicators of malignancy, and their automated detection is very valuable for early breast cancer diagnosis. The main objective of the paper is to detect and segment the tumour from mammogram images that helps to provide support for the clinical decision to perform biopsy of the breast. In this paper, there are two aspects to segmentation in mammography. First is to separate out the mammogram from the background and Second is more difficult, it is the identification of putative masses and the pectoral muscle. The extraction approach is done using basic region growing method to identify the tumor.","Mammography; Region growing; Segmentation","Computers; Diagnostic radiography; Identification (control systems); Tumors; Automated detections; Breast cancers; Breast carcinomas; Cad systems; Clinical decisions; Digital mammogram segmentations; Early breast cancers; Early detections; Initial stages; Microcalcifications; Pectoral muscles; Public healths; Region growing; Region growing methods; Segmentation; Calcification (biochemistry)","","","","","","","Vyborny C.J., Giger M.L., Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence in Mammography, American Journal of Roentgenology, pp. 699-708, (1994); Zhang W., Et al., An improved shift-invariant artificial neural network for computerized detection of clustered microcalcifications in digital mammograms, Medical Physics, 23, pp. 595-601, (1996); Brzakovic D., Et al., An approach to automated detection of tumors in mammograms.

Numerous periodic VOD broadcasting protocols have been proposed to support a large number of receivers. Broadcasting is an efficient transmission scheme to provide on-demand service for very popular movies. This paper proposes a new broadcasting scheme called Popularity Cushion Staggered Broadcasting (PCSB). The proposed scheme improves the Periodic Broadcasting (PB) protocols in the latest mobile VOD system, which is called MobiVoD system. It also, reduces the maximum waiting time of the mobile node, by partitioning the 1 st segment of the whole video and storing it in the Local Media Forwarder (LMF) exactly in the Pool of RAM (PoR), and then transmitting them when the mobile nodes miss the 1 st broadcasted segment. The results show that the PCSB is more efficient and better than the all types of broadcasting and caching techniques in the MobiVoD system. Furthermore, these results exhibits that system performance is stable under high dynamics of the system and the viewer's waiting time are less than the previous system. © 2012 KSII.","MANET; PCSB; Periodic broadcast;

However, multilevel thresholding becomes increasingly more computationally complex as the number of thresholds grows. In order to address this defect, this paper proposes a new multilevel thresholding approach based on the Evolutionary Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA). The arithmetic operators in science were the inspiration for AOA. DAOA is the proposed approach, which employs the Differential Evolution technique to enhance the AOA local research. The proposed algorithm is applied to the multilevel thresholding problem, using Kapur’s measure between class variance functions. The suggested DAOA is used to evaluate images, using eight standard test images from two different groups: Nature and CT COVID-19 images. Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index test (SSIM) are standard evaluation measures used to determine the accuracy of segmented images. The proposed DAOA method’s efficiency is evaluated and compared to other multilevel thresholding methods. The findings are presented with a number of different threshold values (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). According to the experimental results, the proposed DAOA process is better and produces higher-quality solutions than other comparative approaches. Moreover, it achieved better-segmented images, PSNR, and SSIM values. In addition, the proposed DAOA is ranked the first method in all test cases. © 2021 by the authors.

It is considered a part of the e-learning system, which helps disseminate teaching and learning materials. This research explores the benefits of storage technology to enhance the performance of a VOD system in term of serving multi-users within the same buffer with a hybrid storage system (HDD/SSD). This study proposes a streaming management scheme is called (MSA) that uses a SSD as non-volatile cache instead of RAM in a VOD server. This case considers the write workload because of the buffer cache in a SSD for unpopular videos that are stored in HDD. To avoid the negative effects of garbage collection and erase-before-write, MSA adopts OP-FCL to manage the storage capacity of the SSD during buffering. The proposed streaming algorithm is expected to satisfy the performance requirements of a large-scale VOD server in term of input/output throughput. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

The coexistence of various design features and modeling concepts in web hypermedia engineering therefore raises new issues on modeling approach paradigm. In this paper, we present and discuss the uses of object oriented approach and UML paradigm for complex web hypermedia design. Our main objective is to propose a hypermedia design method, called Com+HDM, which is based on UML profile and its general extension mechanisms. We define and propose specific modeling elements, called stereotypes to model conceptual, navigational, and user interface aspects of complex web hypermedia applications. The novelty of our design method stands in the modeling concepts, stereotypes used, and design patterns of the modeling approaches. Some arguments and future refinements will be summarized at the end of the paper. © 2008 IEEE.","","Applications; User interfaces; Complex process; Design features; Design methods; Design patterns; Hypermedia designs; Modeling approaches; Modeling concepts; Modeling elements; Object oriented approaches; Static informations; Transactional workflows; Uml profiles; Web applications; Web hypermedia; Web pages; Machine design","","","","","","","Jantan A.H., Sumari P., Sulaiman S., Design Processes for Web-based Hypermedia Engineering,  Malaysian Software Engineering Conference, pp. 182-186, (2007); Jantan A.H., Sumari P., Sulaiman S., Systematic Design Processes of Hypermedia Engineering: A Case Study of SpLEA-Web,  Regional Conference on Computational Science and Technologies, Sabah, pp. 154-158, (2007); Jantan A.H., Sumari P., Sulaiman S., Computer Science Postgraduate Colloqium (CSPC'07), (2007); Distante D., Rossi G., Canfora G., Tilley S., A Comprehensive Design Model for Integrating Business Processes in Web Applications, Int.

Consultation with plant pathologists to diagnose plant diseases is time consuming, considering that time is an important factor in disease control. Therefore, it is necessary to present a simple, fast, cheap, and precise method for diagnosing plant diseases. In this article, five corn leaf diseases (Southern Leaf Blight, Southern Rust, Gray Leaf Spot, Holcus Spot, and Stewart’s Wilt) are diagnosed using image-processing techniques. After collecting and transferring the diseased leaves to the laboratory, the images of leaves are produced under controlled conditions of light. In the following, four different methods are used to diagnose the disease and then the results are analyzed and compared. In the first proposed method, the damaged areas are separated using histogram equalization method and then a two-layer perceptron neural network classification system is used to categorize the final results and diagnose the disease. In the second method, Laplacian and Canny filters are used to separate the damaged areas. In the third method, the principal components analysis method is used and finally in the fourth method, a combination of Gabor filter and visual features is used to diagnose the disease. The results demonstrate that the combination of Gabor filter and visual features could successfully classify the specified disease spots by means of neural network classification system with the average accuracy of 90.04%. © 2016, Scientific Publishers.

However, VOD performance is limited by the relatively low bandwidth access and high HDD latency access, which increase dramatically when a VOD server receives a large number of simultaneous requests. By contrast, flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) are an attractive alternative because these ensure fast access to an intensive reading system such as VOD. A flash-based SSD only stores popular videos to provide fast access for read-intensive workloads. Unfortunately, replacing the entire HDD with SSD is costly because of its high cost per gigabyte. Therefore, hybrid HDD storage and the small capacity of a flash-based SSD can provide high but cost-effective performance in relation to the storage subsystem of a VOD server. The main goal is to improve the performance of the VOD server by maximizing the number of concurrent user requests and minimizing startup latency in a cost-effective way. Experimental results show that the hybrid HDD storage with flash-based SSD provides better performance than the HDD-based system because it can reduce the average response time for a large-scale VOD storage server by approximately 52.44%. © 2015 IEEE.","Hard disk drives (HDDs); I/O response time; Solid-state-drive (SSD); Video on demand (VOD)","Big data; Computer software; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Digital storage; Drives; Flash-based SSDs; Hard disk storage; Response time (computer systems); Software engineering; Concurrent users; Hard disk drives; Hybrid storages; Solid state drives (SSD); Storage subsystems; Video on demand services; Video on demands (VoD); Video-on-demand servers; Video on demand","","","","","","","Huang T.Y., Handigol N., Heller B., McKeown N., Johari R., Confused, timid, and unstable: Picking a video streaming rate is hard, Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Conference on Internet Measurement Conference, pp. 225-238, (2012); Yu H., Zheng D., Zhao B.Y., Zheng W., Understanding user behavior in large-scale video-on-demand systems, Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGOPS/EuroSys European Conference on Computer Systems, 40, 4, pp. 333-344, (2006); Adhikari V.K., Guo Y., Hao F., Hilt V., Zhang Z.L., A tale of three cdns: An active measurement study of hulu and its cdns, Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), pp. 7-12, (2012); Rahiman A.R., Sumari P., Solid state disk: A new storage device for video storage server, International Symposium on Information Technology, 4, pp. 1-8, (2008); Rizvi S.S., Chung T.S., Data storage framework on flash memory based SSD RAID 0 for performance oriented applications, The 2nd International Conference in Computer and Automation Engineering, 1, pp. 126-128, (2010); Liu Y., Huang J., Xie C., Cao Q., Raf: A random access first cache management to improve SSD-based disk cache, Fifth International Conference on in Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS), pp. 492-500, (2010); Yoshii T., Black C., Chahal S., Solid-State Drives in the Enterprise: A Proof of Concept, (2009); Cho Y., Kim T., An efficient scheduling algorithm for NCQ within SSDs, IEICE Electronics Express, (2015); Jacob B., Ng S., Wang D., Memory Systems: Cache, DRAM, Disk, (2008); An SSD Primer: Why SSDs Are Awesome; Headquarters I., Toshiba NAND Vs.

The DWT (discrete wavelet transform) domain is used for proposed a novel algorithm to place invisible watermark in a video frame based on a three-level DWT using Haar filter. The proposed algorithm is robust against JPEG compression, geometric attacks such as Downscaling, Cropping, and Rotation. It is also robust against Image processing attacks such as low pass filtering (LPF), Median filtering, and Weiner filtering. Furthermore, the algorithm is robust against Noise attacks such as Gaussian noise, Salt and Pepper attacks. The embedded data rate is high and robust. The experimental results show that the embedded watermark is robust and invisible. The watermark was successfully extracted from the video after various attacks.","","Algorithms; Digital watermarking; Discrete wavelet transforms; Image processing; Imaging systems; Multimedia systems; Watermarking; Data rates; Digital video watermarking; Discrete wavelets; Down-scaling; Embedded watermarks; Gaussian noise; Geometric attacks; Haar filter; JPEG compression; Low-pass filtering; Median filtering; Novel algorithm; Three-level; Various attacks; Video frame; Video watermarking; Weiner filtering; Computer graphics","","","","","","","Dugelay J.L., Petitcolas F., Possible counter attacks against random geometric distortions, Paper Presented at the Proceedings of SPIE, Security and Watermarking of Multimedia Contents II, (2000); Voloshynovskiy S., Pereira S., Herrigel A., Baumgartner N., Pun T., Generalized watermarking attack based on watermark estimation and perceptual remodulation, Paper Presented at the Proceedings of SPIE 3971, Security and Watermarking of Multimedia Content II, (2000); Voloshynovskiy S., Pereira S., Pun T., Eggers J.J., Su J.K., Attacks on digital watermarks: Classification, estimation based attacks, and benchmarks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 39, 8, pp. 118-126, (2001); Yiu C.N., Watermarking for Image Authentication and Protection, (2002); Awrangjeb M., Murshed M., Lu G., Global geometric distortion correction in images, Multimedia Signal Processing, 2006 IEEE 8th Workshop on, (2006); Li Y., Gao X., Ji H., A 3D wavelet based spatial-temporal approach for video watermarking, In Proc. 5th Int.

Depending on the number of bits in each cell, Flash memory can be designed as single/multi/triple level cell (SLC/MLC/TLC), which have different performance, density, cost and write endurance characteristics. To bring the best of these together, several researchers have proposed designing SSD using hybrid SLC/MLC/TLC Flash memory. However, these SSDs also present several challenges such as buffer management, placement of hot/cold data in suitable portion, and intelligent garbage collection. Several recent techniques aim to address these challenges. In this paper, we present a survey of techniques for managing SSDs designed with SLC/MLC/TLC Flash memory. We classify the works on several axes to bring out their similarities and differences. We aim to synthesize the state-of-art progress in hybrid SSD management and also spark further research in this area.

For a watermark to be useful, it must be perceptually invisible and robust against any possible attack and image processing by those who seek to corsair the material, researchers have considered various approaches like JPEG compression, geometric distortions and noising. Approach: We proposed a framework based on the Hartung technique which depended on spread spectrum communication in discrete cosine transform (DCT). Results: For the experimental results, researchers had considered various approaches: JPEG compression, geometric distortions and noising. Results showed a good performance in the proposed method. Conclusion: The presented technique was applicable not only to MPEG-2 video, but also to other DCT coding videos like MPEG-1,H261 and H263. Future study could be on improving DCT and comparing it with existing methods. It could be on discrete wavelet transform that is relatively new and has useful properties for the image processing applications. © 2009 Science Publications.","Data hiding; Geometric distortions; JPEG compression; Transform domain; Video; Watermarking","","","","","","","","Voloshynovskiy S., Pereira S., Herrigel A., Baumgartner N., Pun T., Generalized watermarking attack based on watermark estimation and perceptual remodulation, Proceedings of the Security and Watermarking of Multimedia Content II Conference, (2000); Voloshynovskiy S., Pereira S., Pun T., Eggers J.J., Su J.K., Attacks on digital watermarks: Classification, estimation based attacks and benchmarks, IEEE.

Data broadcasting algorithm plays an important role as it instructs the server to disseminate large amount of data at fast rate and send to many mobile clients. One of the work known as Broadcast Disk method is creating a sequence of slots containing data and broadcasting them in circular manner to the air. Mobile clients keep listening to the air and catch those slots that interest them. However based on Broadcast Disk method, some slots are empty, which results into bandwidth waste and client waiting time increment. Empty slots are randomly exists which difficult to locate. In this paper we enhance the Broadcast Disk method to overcome the empty slots aims to reduce the latency of users in accessing the service. We manage to locate these empty slots and fill them with popular data. We show by case studies and simulation that our scheme eliminates empty slots and minimizes client latency. © 2010 University Sains Malaysia.","broadcast schedule; Data broadcasting broadcast disk; latency; mobile information system","Broadcasting; Global system for mobile communications; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Bandwidth waste; Broadcast disks; Broadcast schedule; Data broadcasting; Fast rate; latency; Mobile client; Mobile information systems; Mobile users; Waiting-time; Wireless data networks; Distributed computer systems","","","","","","","Myers B.A., Beigl M., Handheld computing, IEEE Computer Magazine, 36, 9, pp. 27-29, (2003); Barbara D., Mobile computing and database-a survey, IEEE Trans.

Two main steps of Crocodile behaviour are implemented, such as encircling, which is performed by high walking or belly walking, and hunting, which is performed by hunting coordination or hunting cooperation. The mentioned search methods of the proposed RSA are unique compared to other existing algorithms. The performance of the proposed RSA is evaluated using twenty-three classical test functions, thirty CEC2017 test functions, ten CEC2019 test functions, and seven real-world engineering problems. The obtained results of the proposed RSA are compared to various existing optimization algorithms in the literature. The results of the tested three benchmark functions revealed that the proposed RSA achieved better results than the other competitive optimization algorithms. The results of the Friedman ranking test proved that the RSA is a significantly superior method than other comparative methods. Finally, the results of the examined engineering problems showed that the RSA obtained better results compared to other various methods.

In MBO, there are mainly two processes. In the first process, the algorithm emulates how some of the butterflies move from the current position to the new position by the migration operator. In the latter process, the algorithm tunes the position of other butterflies by adjusting operator. In order to enhance the search ability of MBO, an innovation method called MBHS is introduced to tackle the optimization problem. In MBHS, the harmony search (HS) adds mutation operators to the process of adjusting operator to enhance the exploitation, exploration ability, and speed up the convergence rate of MBO. For the purpose to validate the performance of MBHS, 14 benchmark functions are used, and the performance is compared with well-known search algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that MBHS performs better than the basic MBO and other algorithms. © 2015 IEEE.","butterfly optimization; Evolutionary computation; Harmony search","Algorithms; Benchmarking;

To date, it has spanned worldwide with 12.8 million infected and 566, 909 confirm death. Covid-19 screening is indeed an important task and has to be done quickly as possible to many people so that early treatment can be done. The current world RT-PCR standard screening for Covid-19 detection no longer can cope to the demand of large world population. There is a need of other quick diagnosis procedure such as to use chest x-ray images and light computing algorithm to accelerate the covid-19 screening. This paper proposes Covid-19 detection based on chest X-ray image with a light computer processing. The proposed work introduces the combination of Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods to detect Covid-19 symptom. The light version is coming from GLCM simplicity and convolutional neural network (CNN) single layer. It is fast and suitable method for places where computing resources are minimal. With light processing component, the proposed work gives the highest classification performance with 97.06% accuracy compared to other similar works.  © 2021 IEEE.","Chest X-ray image; Convolutional neural network; Covid-19; Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix; learning","Convolution; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Matrix algebra; Multilayer neural networks; 'current; Chest X-ray image; Convolutional neural network; Covid-19; Gray-level co-occurrence matrix; Grey-level co-occurrence matrixes; Learning; Learning models; Modeling architecture; Standard screening; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","Ardila D., Kiraly A.P., Et al., End-to-end lung cancer screening with three-dimensional deep learning on low-dose chest computed tomography, Nature Medicine, 25, 6, (2019); Suzuki K., Overview of deep learning in medical imaging, Radiological Physics and Technology, 10, 3, (2017); Esteva A., Kuprel B., Et al., Dermatologist-level classi cation of skin cancer with deep neural networks, Nature, 542, 7639, pp. 115-118, (2017); Sasikala S., Bharathi M., Sowmiya B.R., Lung cancer detection and classi cation using deep cnn, Interna-tional Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE), 8, 2 S, (2018); Ryu Y.U., Chandrasekaran R., Jacob V.S., Breast cancer prediction using the isotonic separation technique, Eur.

However, the degree of impairment has variable relationship with TBI severity and time post injury. The underlying pathology is often due to diffuse axonal injury that has been found even in mild TBI. In this study, we examine the state of white matter putative connectivity in patients with non-severe TBI in the subacute phase, i.e., within 10 weeks of injury and determine its relationship with neuropsychological scores. Methods: We conducted a case-control prospective study involving 11 male adult patients with non-severe TBI and an age-matched control group of 11 adult male volunteers. Diffusion MRI scanning and neuropsychological tests were administered within 10 weeks post injury. The difference in fractional anisotropy (FA) values between the patient and control groups was examined using tract-based spatial statistics. The FA values that were significantly different between patients and controls were then correlated with neuropsychological tests in the patient group. Results: Several clusters with peak voxels of significant FA reductions (p < 0.05) in the white matter skeleton were seen in patients compared to the control group. These clusters were located in the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and cingulum, as well as white matter fibers in the area of genu of corpus callosum, anterior corona radiata, superior corona radiata, anterior thalamic radiation and part of inferior frontal gyrus. Mean global FA magnitude correlated significantly with MAVLT immediate recall scores while matrix reasoning scores correlated positively with FA values in the area of right superior fronto-occipital fasciculus and left anterior corona radiata. Conclusion: The non-severe TBI patients had abnormally reduced FA values in multiple regions compared to controls that correlated with several measures of executive function during the sub-acute phase of TBI.

Most of the steganographic methods either use spatial domain or frequency domain for embedding the secret information. Current hybrid methods require the original cover image to extract the secret information making these methods to become not practical. This paper proposes a new blind steganographic method for digital images that combines spatial and frequency domains and does not rely on the cover image in extracting the secret information. The proposed method utilizes a chaotic map to scramble the secret information before the embedding procedure takes place. A coding map is generated during the work on spatial domain, and the original image is transformed into DWT domain, then the generated coding map is embedded in the coefficients of LL and HL sub-bands of the cover image. The drawn experimental results show that the resultant stego-images have high quality and the proposed method provides high embedding capacity compared with other methods and is robust against the visual analysis and other image processing attacks such as lossy compression and added noise. © 2013 Engineering and Technology Publishing.","Chaotic map; Frequency domain; Haar-DWT; Spatial domain; Steganography","Chaotic systems; Digital storage; Discrete wavelet transforms; Frequency domain analysis; Image compression; Steganography; Chaotic map; Embedding capacity; Embedding procedures; Frequency domains; Haar-DWT; Secret information; Spatial and frequency domain; Spatial domains; Image coding","","","","","","","Safy R.E.L., Zayed H., Dessouki El A., An Adaptive Steganographic Technique Based On Integer Wavelet Transform, Proc.

The hybrid storage system, which combines HDDs and SSD in the server, has become popular because of such requirements. The combination of both storage modes is relatively weak in terms of optimising fast access prior and in supporting the production of a high number of simultaneous streams. This paper presents an enhanced hybrid storage system (EHSS)-based VOD server to improve the performance of the VOD server. The design of the EHSS and its streaming management scheme produce high performance and satisfy the performance requirements of a VOD server in terms of I/O throughput and access latency. The experimental results show that the proposed work provides better performance than the VOD server-based FADM because it enhances the average response times for the various scales of intensive workload by 69.89%.

Most of these services use multi-tier architecture for flexible scaling and software reusability. However, managing the performance of multi-tier web services under dynamic and unpredictable workload, and different resource demands in each tier is a critical problem for a service provider. When offering quality of service assurance with least resource usage costs, web service providers should adopt self-adaptive resource provisioning in each tier. Recently, a number of rule- and model-based approaches have been designed for dynamic resource management in virtualized data centers. This survey investigates the challenges of resource provisioning and provides a competing assessment on the existing approaches. After the evaluation of their benefits and drawbacks, the new research direction to improve the efficiency of resource management and recommendations are introduced. © 2016 KSII.","Cloud computing; Multi-tier Application; Quality of service; Resource management","Client server computer systems; Cloud computing; Computer software reusability; Information management; Natural resources management; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Reusability; Surveys; Telecommunication services; Websites; Dynamic resource management; Model based approach; Multi tier architecture; Multi-tier applications; Quality of service assurances; Resource management; Virtualized data centers; Web service providers; Web services","","","","","","","Douglas, Barry K., Web Services, Service-Oriented Architectures, and Cloud Computing: The Savvy Manager's Guide, (2003); Fielding R.T., Kaiser G., The Apache HTTP Server Project, IEEE Internet Computing, 1, 4, pp. 88-90, (1997); Tomcat 6.0.44; The Java Community Process Program; Menasc D.A., Almeida V.A.F., Dowdy Larry W., Capacity Planning for Web Services: Metrics, Models, and Methods, (2002); Kleinrock, Leonard, Queuing Systems, 2, (1976); Chandra A., Gong W., Shenoy P., Dynamic resource allocation for shared data centers using online measurements, Proc. of Quality of Service—IWQoS 2003, pp. 381-398, (2003); Xiong P., Wang Z., Jung G., Pu C., Study on performance management and application behavior in virtualized environment, Proc. of Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS), 2010 IEEE, pp. 841-844, (2010); Urgaonkar B., Pacifici G., Shenoy P., Spreitzer M., Tantawi A., An Analytical Model for Multi-Tier Internet Services and Its Applications, Proc. of ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review, 33, pp. 291-302, (2005); (2012); Wei J., Cheng-Zhong X., EQoS: Provisioning of client-perceived end-to-end QoS guarantees in web servers, Computers, IEEE Transactions, 55, 12, pp. 1543-1556, (2006); Liu X., Sha L., Diao Y., Froehlich S., Hellerstein J.L., Parekh S., Online response time optimization of apache web server, Proc. of Quality of Service—IWQoS 2003, pp. 461-478, (2003); Zhou D., Huang W.W., Using a fuzzy classification approach to assess e-commerce web sites: An empirical investigation, ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT), 9, 3, (2009); Diao Y., Hellerstein J.L., Parekh S., Optimizing quality of service using fuzzy controlManagement Technologies for E-Commerce and E-Business Applications, pp. 42-53, (2002); Lama P., Zhou X., Autonomic provisioning with self-adaptive neural fuzzy control for percentile-based delay guarantee, ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS), 8, 2, (2013); Rao J., Wei Y., Gong J., Cheng-Zhong X., Qos guarantees and service differentiation for dynamic cloud applications, Network and Service Management, IEEE Transactions, 10, 1, pp. 43-55, (2013); Maurer M., Brandic I., Sakellariou R., Self-adaptive and resource-efficient SLA enactment for cloud computing infrastructures, Proc. of Cloud Computing (CLOUD), 2012 IEEE 5Th International Conference On, pp. 368-375, (2012); Lama P., Zhou X., Efficient server provisioning with control for end-to-end response time guarantee on multitier clusters, Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions On, 23, 1, pp. 78-86, (2012); Wang L., Jing X., Zhao M., Yicheng T., Fortes J.A.B., Fuzzy modeling based resource management for virtualized database systems, Proc. of Modeling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS), 2011 IEEE 19Th International Symposium On, pp. 32-42, (2011); Martinez J.F., Ipek E., Dynamic multicore resource management: A machine learning approach, Micro, IEEE, 29, 5, pp. 8-17, (2009); Tesauro G., Jong N.K., Das R., Bennani M.N., A hybrid reinforcement learning approach to autonomic resource allocation, Proc. of Autonomic Computing, 2006.

While some subspecies of fruits can be easily differentiated, others may require an expertness to differentiate them. Although farmers rely on the traditional methods to identify and classify fruit types, the methods are prone to so many challenges. Training a machine to identify and classify fruit types in place of traditional methods can ensure precision fruit classification. By taking advantage of the state-of-the-art image recognition techniques, we approach fruits classification from another perspective by proposing a high performing hybrid deep learning which could ensure precision mangosteen fruit classification. This involves a proposed optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model compared to other optimized models such as Xception, VGG16, and ResNet50 using Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad, and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizers on specified dense layers and filters numbers. The proposed CNN model has three types of layers that make up its model, they are: 1) the convolutional layers, 2) the pooling layers, and 3) the fully connected (FC) layers. The first convolution layer uses convolution filters with a filter size of 3x3 used for initializing the neural network with some weights prior to updating to a better value for each iteration. The CNN architecture is formed from stacking these layers. Our self-acquired dataset which is composed of four different types of Malaysian mangosteen fruit, namely Manggis Hutan, Manggis Mesta, Manggis Putih and Manggis Ungu was employed for the training and testing of the proposed CNN model. The proposed CNN model achieved 94.99% classification accuracy higher than the optimized Xception model which achieved 90.62% accuracy in the second position. © 2021 Lavoisier.

In result, nowadays a lot of technologies and protocols are being developed to facilitate the developers to develop such type of applications at rapid pace. Most of these applications are desktop-based; only the desktop users can view regular contents and make conversation. The software we have developed is a LAN-based using client/server and Peer to peer architecture for transmitting and receiving multimedia contents. Such types of software already exist in the market, lacking the feature of portability and in result clients are bound to use Microsoft platform. Our paper expose this problem; LAN clients of this application can use any sort of platform, as they are based-Java also provides many other useful utilities for heterogeneous system such as voice and video Streaming and registry service and security issues are also considered. Totally work based on Java Technology environments, this project includes Custom Clients and Registry Server also persistency as well as database connectivity at backend. In particular in this work we have taken full advantage of Java's beauty by using Java Network Library and (JMF) Java Media Framework ,additional we have created lot of user define protocols to develop and facilitate developers to develop their own Multimedia based applications rapidly. © 2010 IEEE.","Media streaming;

Researchers are trying to find new algorithms to inspect all inbound and outbound activities and identify suspicious patterns that may show an attempted system attack. The proposed technique for detecting intrusions uses the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) to solve feature selection problems and hybridizing it with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to utilize the best value to update the information of each grey wolf position. This technique preserves the individual's best position information by the PSO algorithm, which prevents the GWO algorithm from falling into a local optimum. The NSL KDD dataset is used to verify the performance of the proposed technique. The classification is done using the k-means and SVM algorithms to measure the performance in terms of accuracy, detection rate, false alarm rate, number of features, and execution time. The results have shown that the proposed technique attained the necessary improvement of the GWO algorithm when using K-means or SVM algorithms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Grey wolf optimization (GWO); Intrusion detection system (IDS); K-means; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Wireless sensor networks (WSN)","Computer crime; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; K-means clustering; Network security; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Gray wolf optimization; Gray wolves; Intrusion detection system; Intrusion Detection Systems; K-means; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Particle swarm optimization; Performance; Wireless sensor network; Wireless sensor networks","","","","","Taif University, TU; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University, (TURSP-2020/300)","This study was financially supported via a funding grant by Deanship of Scientific Research, Taif University Researchers Supporting Project number (TURSP-2020/300), Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia ","That ‘internet of things’ thing.

The size, shape, skin color, sweetness or even flesh color will be different depending on the cultivar. Thus, classification of salak based on their cultivar become a daily job for the fruit farmers. There are many techniques that can be used for fruit classification using computer vision technology. Deep learning is the most promising algorithm compared to another Machine Learning (ML) algorithm. This paper presents an image classification method on 4 types of salak (salak pondoh, salak gading, salak sideempuan and salak affinis) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), VGG16 and ResNet50. The dataset consists of 1000 images which having 250 of images for each type of salak. Pre-processing on the dataset is required to standardize the dataset by resizing the image into 224 * 224 pixels, convert into jpg format and augmentation. Based on the accuracy result from the model, the best model for the salak classification is ResNet50 which gave an accuracy of 84% followed by VGG16 that gave an accuracy of 77% and CNN which gave 31%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CNN;

Current discrete wavelet transform (DWT) steganography adds an unacceptable distortion to the images and is considered as an ineffective in terms of security. Applying the DE scheme to the current DWT steganographic methods solves the problems of these methods, and reduces the distortion added to the images, and thus improves the embedding efficiency. The proposed algorithm first converts the secret image into a sequence of base-5 digits. After that, the cover image is transformed into the DWT domain and segmented into 2 × 1 coefficient pairs. The DE scheme is used then to change at most one coefficient of each coefficient pair to embed the base-5 digits. Experimental results depict that the proposed algorithm is more efficient in embedding compared to other methods in terms of embedding payload and image quality. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is attacked by well-known steganalysis software. Results are showing that the proposed algorithm is secure against the powerful universal steganalyzer “ensemble classifier” and the histogram attack. The results also reveal that the proposed algorithm is robust against different image processing attacks such as compression, added noise, and cropping attacks. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Diamond encoding (DE); Discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Embedding payload; Image steganography; Imperceptibility","Diamonds; Discrete wavelet transforms; Encoding (symbols); Image coding; Image processing; Steganography; Wavelet transforms; Diamond encoding; Embedding algorithms; Embedding efficiency; Embedding payload; Ensemble classifiers; Image steganography; Imperceptibility; Steganographic algorithms; Digital image storage","","","","","","","Al-Ani Z.K., Et al., Overview: main fundamentals for steganography, J Comput, 2, 3, pp. 158-165, (2010); Al-Dmour H., Al-Ani A., A steganography embedding method based on edge identification and XOR coding, Exp Syst Appl, 46, pp. 293-306, (2016); Al-Korbi H.A., Al-Ataby A., Al-Taee M.A., Al-Nuaimy W., High-capacity image steganography based on Haar DWT for hiding miscellaneous data, IEEE Jordan Conf Appl Electrical Eng Comput Technol (AEECT), 1, pp. 1-6, (2015); Atawneh S., Almomani A., Sumari P., Steganography in digital images: common approaches and tools, IETE Tech Rev, 30, 4, pp. 344-358, (2013); Baby D., Thomas J., Augustine G., George E., Michael N.R., A novel DWT based image securing method using steganography, Procedia Comput Sci, 46, pp. 612-618, (2015); Barve S., Nagaraj U., Gulabani R., Efficient and secure biometric image stegnography using discrete wavelet transform, Int J Comput Sci Commun Netw, 1, 1, pp. 96-99, (2011); Chan C.-K., Cheng L.-M., Hiding data in images by simple LSB substitution, Pattern Recogn, 37, 3, pp. 469-474, (2004); Chao R.M., Et al., A novel image data hiding scheme with diamond encoding, EURASIP J Inf Secur, 2009, 1, pp. 1-9, (2009); Chen M., Et al., Analysis of current steganography tools: classifications & features.

The WM of individuals sustaining traumatic brain injury (TBI) was commonly compromised, especially in the domain of WM. The current study investigated the brain responses of WM in a group of participants with mild–moderate TBI compared to their healthy counterparts employing functional magnetic resonance imaging. All consented participants (healthy: n = 26 and TBI: n = 15) performed two variations of the n-back WM task with four load conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back). The respective within-group effects showed a right hemisphere-dominance activation and slower reaction in performance for the TBI group. Random-effects analysis revealed activation difference between the two groups in the right occipital lobe in the guided n-back with cues, and in the bilateral occipital lobe, superior parietal region, and cingulate cortices in the n-back without cues. The left middle frontal gyrus was implicated in the load-dependent processing of WM in both groups. Further group analysis identified that the notable activation changes in the frontal gyri and anterior cingulate cortex are according to low and high loads. Though relatively smaller in scale, this study was eminent as it clarified the neural alterations in WM in the mild–moderate TBI group compared to healthy controls. It confirmed the robustness of the phenomenon in TBI with the reproducibility of the results in a heterogeneous non-Western sample. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","cingulate cortex; functional magnetic resonance imaging; prefrontal cortex; traffic accidents; traumatic brain injury; working memory","Brain Concussion; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Malaysia; Memory, Short-Term; Reproducibility of Results; adult; anterior cingulate; Article; cingulate gyrus; clinical article; controlled study; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; male; middle frontal gyrus; occipital lobe; right hemisphere; statistics; traffic accident; traumatic brain injury; working memory; brain concussion; diagnostic imaging; Malaysia; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; short term memory","","","","","Alwani Liyana Ahmad; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (1001/PPSP/8012307, TRGS/1/2015/USM/01/6/3); Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, HUSM","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia for Trans‐disciplinary Research Grant Scheme (TRGS) with Project Code: TRGS/1/2015/USM/01/6/3 and Research University Grant (RUI) 1001/PPSP/8012307.

The best thresholding values are found using various techniques, including Otsu and Kapur-based techniques. These techniques work well for bi-level thresholding, but when used to find the appropriate thresholds for multi-level thresholding, there will be issues with long calculation times, high computational costs, and the need for accuracy improvements. This work investigates the capability of the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm to discover the best multilayer thresholding for picture segmentation to circumvent this issue. The leading mathematical arithmetic operators' distributional nature is used by the AOA method. The picture histogram was used to construct the candidate solutions in the modified algorithms, which were then updated according to the algorithm's features. The solutions are evaluated using Otsu's fitness function throughout the optimization process. The picture histogram is used to display the algorithm's potential solutions. The proposed approach is tested on five frequent photos from the Berkeley University database. The fitness function, root-mean-squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and other widely used assessment metrics were utilized to assess the performance of the suggested segmentation approach. Many benchmark pictures were employed to verify the suggested technique's effectiveness and evaluate it against other well-known optimization methods described in the literature. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Arithmetic optimization algorithm; Image segmentation; Meta-heuristic algorithms; Multi-level thresholding","Graphic methods; Heuristic algorithms; Mathematical operators; Mean square error; Optimization; Signal to noise ratio; Arithmetic optimization algorithm; Case-studies; Chest X-ray image; Fitness functions; Images segmentations; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Multilevel thresholding; Optimization algorithms; Thresholding images; Image segmentation","","","","","","","Cheng H.-D., Et al., Color image segmentation: advances and prospects, Pattern Recogn, 34, 12, pp. 2259-2281, (2001); Liu Q., Li N., Jia H., Qi Q., Abualigah L., A chimp-inspired remora optimization algorithm for multilevel thresholding image segmentation using cross entropy, Artif Intell Rev, pp. 1-58, (2023); Alaiad A.I., Mugdadi E.A., Hmeidi I.I., Obeidat N., Abualigah L., Predicting the severity of COVID-19 from lung CT images using novel deep learning, J Med Biol Eng, 43, 2, pp. 135-146, (2023); Chakraborty S., Saha A.K., Ezugwu A.E., Agushaka J.O., Zitar R.A., Abualigah L., Differential evolution and its applications in image processing problems: A comprehensive review, Arch Comput Methods Eng, 30, 2, pp. 985-1040, (2023); Ye Q., Gao W., Zeng W., International Conference on Multimedia and Expo.

One of the important components of this environment is the server with broadcasting capabilities. Data are fetched from the server and being broadcast to the air. Mobile users keep listening within the air and catch those data that interest him. In one of the work known as the Acharya algorithm (Acharya et al., 1995) has focused on developing algorithm for arranging the sequence order of data to be broadcasted. The work has generated the sequence of data to be broadcast with the policy of broadcasting more popular data compare to the less popular one. However, the work does not covers the overhead issue incurred by the disk during actual data retrieval task in order to satisfy the broadcasting order. In this paper, we present a data organization called sequence to be used as a data storing method in the server to support broadcasting environments. Our scheme, the sequence order of data to be stored on physical disk, is basically similar in pattern to the sequence order of data to be broadcasted. Having this approach the server's disk incurs less overhead (seek and latency). We show by simulation result that our scheme has reduced the overhead of Acharya scheme by average 60%.

It involves analyzing dynamic information and behaviors that are stored in the execution trace. However, the execution traces of current object-oriented software systems tend to be very large in terms of complexity and size. In particular, classes and coupling features form a very complicated interwoven lattice of the dynamic dependencies. This research focuses on detecting and removing utility classes from an execution trace. Utility detection and removal techniques are very useful in reducing the structural complexity of execution traces for software comprehension process. For this purpose, two new utility classes detection metrics based on dynamic coupling have been introduced to measure the extent to which a class can be considered as a utility. © 2017 IEEE.","dynamic coupling; execution trace analysis; object-oriented; software comprehension; software maintenance; utility classes","Computer software maintenance; Trace analysis; Dynamic couplings; Execution trace analysis; Object oriented; Software comprehension; utility classes; Object oriented programming","","","","","","","Demeyer S., Ducasse S., Nierstrasz O., Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns, (2003); Ko A.J., Myers B.A., Coblenz M.J., Aung H.H., An exploratory study of how developers seek, relate, and collect relevant information during software maintenance tasks, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 32, 12, pp. 971-987, (2006); Storey M.-A., Theories, tools and research methods in program comprehension: Past, present and future, Software Quality Journal, Springer, 14, pp. 187-208, (2006); Lethbridge T.C., Singer J., Forward A., How software engineers use documentation: The state of the practice, IEEE Software Special Issue: The State of the Practice of Software Engineering, pp. 35-39, (2003); Sommerville I., Software Engineering, (2011); SWEBOK V3 Software Engineering Body of Knowledge, (2012); Muller H.A., Orgun M.A., Tilley S.R., Uhl J.S., A reverse engineering approach to subsystem structure identification, Journal of Software Maintenance: Research and Practice, 5, 4, pp. 181-204, (1993); Ball T., The concept of dynamic analysis, Proceedings of the 7th European Software Engineering Conference (ESEC/FSE'99), September 1999, pp. 216-234, (1999); Arisholm E., Briand L., Foyen A., Dynamic coupling measurement for object-oriented software, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 30, 8, pp. 491-506, (2004); Zaidman A., Demeyer S., Automatic identification of key classes in a software system using webmining techniques, Journal of Software Maintenance and Evolution: Research and Practice, 20, 6, pp. 387-417, (2008); Chhabra J.K., Gupta V., A survey of dynamic software metrics, Journal of Computer Science and Technology, 25, 4, pp. 1016-1029, (2010); Gupta V., Validation of dynamic coupling metrics for object-oriented software, ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, 36, 5, pp. 1-3, (2011); Webster B.F., Simon P., Why new systems fail, Course Technology, a Part of Cengage Learning, (2011); De Pauw W., Helm R., Kimelman D., Vlissides J., Visualizing the behaviour of object-oriented systems, Proceedings of the 8th Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications, pp. 326-337, (1993); Jerding D., Rugaber S., Using visualisation for architecture localization and extraction, Proceedings of the 4th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 56-65, (1997); Systa T., Understanding the behavior of Java programs, Proceedings of the 7th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 214-223, (2000); Cornelissen B., Zaidman A., Van Deursen A., A controlled experiment for program comprehension through trace visualization, Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE).

This study aims to use deep learning to construct a design for Sapodilla identification and classification. Sapodilla comes in a various of varieties from throughout the world. Sapodilla can come in different sizes, form, and taste depending on species and kind. The goal is to create a system which uses convolutional neural networks and transfer learning to extract the feature and determine the type of Sapodilla. The system can sort the type of Sapodilla. This research uses a dataset including over 1000 pictures to demonstrate four different types of Sapodilla classification approaches. This assignment was completed using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms, a deep learning technology widely utilised in image classification. Deep learning-based classifiers have recently allowed to distinguish Sapodilla from various images. Furthermore, we utilized different versions of hidden layer and epochs for various outcomes to improve predictive performance. We investigated transfer learning approaches in the classification of Sapodilla in the suggested study. The suggested CNN model improves transfer learning techniques and state-of-the-art approaches in terms of results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Sapodilla; Transfer learning","","","","","","","","Australian Vegetable Growing Farms: An Economic Survey, 2013–14 and 2014–, (2015); Abualigah L., Al-Okbi N.K., Elaziz M.A., Houssein E.H., Boosting marine predators algorithm by salp swarm algorithm for multilevel thresholding image segmentation, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 81, 12, pp. 16707-16742, (2022); Palakodati S.S.S., Chirra V.R., Dasari Y., Bulla S., Fresh and rotten fruits classification using CNN and transfer learning, Revue d’Intelligence Artificielle, 34, 5, pp. 617-622, (2020); Sakib S., Ashrafi Z., Siddique M.A., Implementation of fruits recognition classifier using convolutional neural network algorithm for observation of accuracies for various hidden layers, Arxiv, Abs/1904, (2019); Mettleq A.S.A., Dheir I.M., Elsharif A.A., Abu-Naser S.S., Mango classification using deep learning, International Journal of Academic Engineering Research (IJAER), 3, 12, pp. 22-29, (2020); Rojas-Arandra J.L., Nunez-Varela J.I., Cuevas-Tello J.C., Rangel-Ramirez G., Fruit classification for retail stores using deep learning, Proceedings of Pattern Recognition 12Th Mexican Conference, pp. 3-13, (2020); Risdin F., Mondal P., Hassan K.M., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Detecting Fruit Information Using Machine Learning Techniques, (2020); Abualigah L., Diabat A., Mirjalili S., Abd Elaziz M., Gandomi A.H., The arithmetic optimization algorithm, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 376, (2021); Abualigah L., Yousri D., Abd Elaziz M., Ewees A.A., Al-Qaness M.A., Gandomi A.H., Aquila optimizer: A novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 157, (2021); Abualigah L., Abd Elaziz M., Sumari P., Geem Z.W., Gandomi A.H., Reptile search algorithm (RSA): A nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimizer, Expert Systems with Applications, 191, (2022); Agushaka J.O., Ezugwu A.E., Abualigah L., Dwarf mongoose optimization algorithm, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 391, (2022); Oyelade O.N., Ezugwu A.E.S., Mohamed T.I., Abualigah L., Ebola optimization search algorithm: A new nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 16150-16177, (2022); Ezugwu A.E., Agushaka J.O., Abualigah L., Mirjalili S., Gandomi A.H., Prairie dog optimization algorithm, Neural Computing and Applications, pp. 1-49, (2022); Alvarez-Canchila O.I., Arroyo-Perez D.E., Patino-Saucedo A., Gonzalez H.R., Patino-Vanegas A., Colombian Fruit and Vegetables Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning, (2020); Otair M., Abualigah L., Qawaqzeh M.K., Improved near-lossless technique using the Huffman coding for enhancing the quality of image compression, Multimedia Tools and Applications, pp. 1-21, (2022); Liu Q., Li N., Jia H., Qi Q., Abualigah L., Modified remora optimization algorithm for global optimization and multilevel thresholding image segmentation, Mathematics, 10, 7, (2022); Lin S., Jia H., Abualigah L., Altalhi M., Enhanced slime mould algorithm for multilevel thresholding image segmentation using entropy measures, Entropy, 23, 12, (2021); Yang F., Liang Z., Design of a low parasitic inductance SiC power module with double-sided cooling, IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC), 2017, pp. 3057-3062, (2017); Srivastava R.K., Greff K., Schmidhuber J., Training very deep networks, Corr Abs/1507, (2015)","L.

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning can provide an excellent solution to recognize fruits, where the methods are known to be able to classify objects with high accuracy. In this study, several models were proposed and constructed to recognize the Jackfruit and Cempedak using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). We proposed our custom-made own CNN model and modify five transfer learning models on pre-trained VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. The experiment used our own dataset and the result showed that the proposed CNN architecture was able to provide an accuracy between 89% to 93.67% compared to the other CNN transfer learning. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

However, this system causes some user pains and problems, i.e. high capital investment, setup and maintenance hassle, lack of flexibility and reliability, and data security and privacy concern. Cloud computing as an emerging technology is used for developing a cloud-based POS software named RetailNow. A cloud service provider is in charge of delivering and maintenances of the software to retailers based on their environments. The provider is also responsible for security and privacy of data on its servers. Due to the pay-per-use subscription model of the cloud, retailers also save in their finance. The retailers only require a basic computer and an internet connection in order to connect to RetailNow. RetailNow is targeted for all scales and environments of retail outlets. The purpose of the study is to understand the influential factors that impact on intention to use RetailNow among retailers in Malaysia. The proposed model is the combination of the TOE and the TAM to obtain applicability and predictive power. In order to test the proposed model, a quantitative study using a self-administrated survey will be directed. A research method which is based on the multi-analytical approach of Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is applied which enables extra verification of the results provided by the PLS-SEM for direct relationships in the model. We only apply PLS-SEM for testing the mediation effect. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","ANN; Cloud-based POS; PLS-SEM; RetailNow; SaaS; TAM; The Point of Sale (POS) system; TOE","Data privacy; Investments; Least squares approximations; Neural networks; Soft computing; Cloud service providers; Cloud-based; Data security and privacy; Partial least square (PLS); Point of sale; RetailNow; SaaS; Structural equation modeling; Sales","","","","","","","Blokdijk G., Point of sale—simple Steps to Win, Insights and Opportunities for Maxing out Success, (2015); Margaret Weber M., Prasad Kantamneni S., POS and EDI in retailing: An examination of underlying benefits and barriers, Supply Chain Manag, 7, 5, pp. 311-317, (2002); Tolbert F., Why point of sales data matters for demand management, J.

In this study, we explore the functional reorganization of the default mode network (DMN) of those affected with non-severe TBI. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a wide-spectrum disease that has heterogeneous effects on its victims and impacts everyday functioning. The functional disruption of the default mode network (DMN) after TBI has been established, but its link to causal effective connectivity remains to be explored. This study investigated the differences in the DMN between healthy participants and mild and moderate TBI, in terms of functional and effective connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Nineteen non-severe TBI (mean age 30.84 ± 14.56) and twenty-two healthy (HC; mean age 27.23 ± 6.32) participants were recruited for this study. Resting-state fMRI data were obtained at the subacute phase (mean days 40.63 ± 10.14) and analyzed for functional activation and connectivity, independent component analysis, and effective connectivity within and between the DMN. Neuropsychological tests were also performed to assess the cognitive and memory domains. Compared to the HC, the TBI group exhibited lower activation in the thalamus, as well as significant functional hypoconnectivity between DMN and LN. Within the DMN nodes, decreased activations were detected in the left inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, and right superior frontal gyrus. Altered effective connectivities were also observed in the TBI group and were linked to the diminished activation in the left parietal region and precuneus. With regard to intra-DMN connectivity within the TBI group, positive correlations were found in verbal and visual memory with the language network, while a negative correlation was found in the cognitive domain with the visual network. Our results suggested that aberrant activities and functional connectivities within the DMN and with other RSNs were accompanied by the altered effective connectivities in the TBI group. These alterations were associated with impaired cognitive and memory domains in the TBI group, in particular within the language domain. These findings may provide insight for future TBI observational and interventional research. Copyright © 2022 Abdul Rahman, Abd Hamid, Noh, Omar, Chai, Idris, Ahmad, Fitzrol, Ab.

It provides users a service to browse and watch any video at any time with VCR (rewind, forward and pause) operations. One of the requirements for VOD system implementation is to have a VOD server that acts as an engine to deliver videos from the server's disk to users. Designing VOD server, particularly the video layout component on the server's disk, is an interesting issue as it determines the number of streams being delivered to users. Video blocks should be laid intelligently with less latency on disk and hence produce high number of streams. However, due to real time and large volume characteristics possessed by the video, the designing of video layout is a challenging task. Real time constraints the distribution of blocks on disk and hence decrease the number of streams being delivered to users. Another important aspect of designing video layout is the VCR operation service since it provides interactivity. It possesses the same challenge as in streaming videos to users as it consumes bandwidth of the server. In this paper we present a new video layout scheme for a VOD server called Disk-region storage scheme. The scheme partitions the disks into regions and uses a special algorithm to distribute blocks of video data within regions. The scheme is capable of producing a high number of streams as well as providing VCR operations to users. The simulation showed that the scheme increases the number of simultaneous stream by 15%. The scheme is also being designed with a simple one-way data retrieval mechanism and has a good load balancing on an array of disks.","Data storage; Simultaneous streams; VCR operations; VOD server","","","","","","","","Chang E., Garcia-Molina H., Reducing Initial Latency in Media Servers, IEEE Multimedia, pp. 50-61, (1997); Chang C.K., Shih C.-C., A Circular Skip-Cluster Scheme to Support Video-on-Demand Services, Multimedia System, 7, 2, pp. 107-118, (1999); Chua T.S., Li J., Ooi B.C., Tan K.L., Disk Stripping Strategies for Large Video-on-Demand Servers, The 4th ACM International Multimedia Conference, pp. 297-306, (1996); Srivastava A., Kumar A., Singru A., Design and Analysis of a Video-on-Demand Server, Multimedia Systems, 5, 4, pp. 238-254, (1997); Furht B., Kalra D., Kitson F.L., Rodriguez A.A., Wall W.E., Design Issues for Interactive Television Systems, Computer, 28, 5, pp. 25-39, (1995); Gemmell D.J., Vin H.M., Kandlur D.D., Rangan P.V., Rowe L.A., Multimedia Storage Server: A Tutorial, Computer, 28, 5, pp. 40-49, (1995); Ghandeharizadeh S., Kim S.H., Shahabi C., On Configuring a Single Disk Continuous Media Server, SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation, 23, 1, pp. 37-46, (1995); Liu J.C.L., Du D.H.C., Schnepf J.A., Supporting Random Access on Real-Time Retrieval of Digital Continuous Media, Computer Communications, 18, 3, pp. 145-159, (1995); Li V.O.K., Liao W., Distributed Multimedia System, Proceeding of the IEEE, 85, 7, pp. 1063-1108, (1997); Ozden B., Rastogi R., Silberschatz A., On the Design of a Low-Cost Video-on-Demand Storage System, Multimedia System, 4, 1, pp. 40-54, (1996); Subrahmanium V.S., Jajoda S., Multimedia Database Systems: Issues and Research Directions, pp. 237-261, (1996); Sumari P., Merabti M., Pereira R., Video-on-Demand Server: Strategies for Improving Performance, IEE Proceedings Software, 146, 1, pp. 33-37, (1999); Wu C.-S., Ma G.-K., Liu M.-C., A Scalable Storage Supporting Multistream Real-Time Data Retrieval, Multimedia System, 7, pp. 458-466, (1999); Ruemmler C., Wilkes J., An Introduction to Disk Drive Modelling, IEEE Computer, (1994)","P.

Here, we are describing the major types of Malaysia meat dish cuisine food. Beef is the most prevalent meat in Malaysian cuisine and it can be prepared in various methods. Depending on the dish, the beef dish can be cooked with different methods, and ingredients and comes with a different flavour. Automatic image recognition is a convenient option for labelling and categorizing dishes. In this paper, the five types of beef dishes classification approaches are presented with a dataset that contains approximately 1843 images captured with different positions, viewpoints, lighting, colours, scale, etc. The proposed model classifies the type of beef dishes from the input images containing daging kunyit, masak merah, rendang, sate and sup gearbox. For this project, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms, a deep learning approach widely utilised in image recognition, were used. Additionally, transfer learning approaches in the categorization of meat dishes were examined. By using the parameters of a pretrained dish classification model as the new beginning parameters of the proposed neural network, transfer learning was achieved. The transfer learning model outperforms CNN in terms of accuracy compared with the same model when trained with random initial weights. The final classification accuracy of the transfer learning model by ResNet50 was 89.40% which is higher compared to the proposed CNN deep learning architecture at 54.35% accuracy. The accuracy level of 89.40%, demonstrates the feasibility of this approach in the classification of meat dishes. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023.","convolutional neural network; deep learning; kunyit; Lauk daging; masak merah; rendang; sate; sup gearbox; transfer learning","Beef; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Image recognition; Learning systems; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Kunyit; Lauk daging; Malaysia; Masak merah; Rendang; Sate; Sup gearbox; Transfer learning; Deep learning","","","","","","","Shadman Sakib1 Z.

IPTV is a system that exploits the high speed broadband networks to deliver TV services to the subscribers. From the service provider viewpoint, the challenge in IPTV systems is how to build delivery networks that exploits the resources efficiently and reduces the service cost, as well. However, designing such delivery networks are affected by many factors including choosing the suitable network architecture, load balancing, resources waste, and cost reduction. Furthermore, IPTV contents characteristics; particularly size, popularity, and interactivity play an important role in balancing the load and avoiding the resources waste for delivery networks. Ignoring the content status in solving delivery networks issues particularly replica placement, request distribution, and resource allocation problems leads to load imbalance, which in turn, leads to performance degradation in IPTV system. In this survey paper, we introduce IPTV delivery networks terminology and taxonomy. Upon that, we investigate the challenges related to the contents’ awareness in those delivery networks. At the end of the paper, we propose a content-awareness in ITV delivery networks and CDN as the future direction and discuss its importance in different aspects as request redirection, resource allocation, and replica placement. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Content status; Delivery networks; IPTV; IPTV delivery networks; Load balancing; Replica placement","Computer graphics; Cost reduction; HIgh speed networks; IPTV; Multimedia systems; Network architecture; Resource allocation; Surveys; Television broadcasting; Content status; Load imbalance; Performance degradation; Replica placement; Request distributions; Request redirection; Resource allocation problem; Service provider; Broadband networks","","","","","","","Aldana Diaz M.E., Huh E.N., Cost analysis on IPTV hosting service for 3rd party providers, Proc 5Th Int Conf Ubiquitous Inform Manag Commun, (2011); Alemany J., Thathachar J.S., Random striping news on demand servers, (1997); Almeida J.M., Streaming content distribution networks with minimum delivery cost, (2003); Belbekkouche A., Hasan M., Karmouch A., Resource discovery and allocation in network virtualization, Commun Surveys Tutor IEEE, 14, 4, pp. 1114-1128, (2012); Bikfalvi A., Garcia-Reinoso J., Vidal I., Valera F., Azcorra A., P2P vs. IP multicast: comparing approaches to IPTV streaming based on TV channel popularity, Comput Netw, 5, 6, pp. 1310-1325, (2011); Bisdikian C.C., Patel B.V., Cost-based program allocation for distributed multimedia-on-demand systems, IEEE Multimed, 3, 3, pp. 62-72, (1996); Bolosky W.J., Barrera J.S., Draves R.P., Fitzgerald R.P., Gibson G.A., Jones M.B., Levi S.P., Myhrvold N.P., Rashid R.F., The Tiger Video Fileserver, (1996); Borzemski L., Zatwarnicki K., CDNs with global adaptive request distribution, Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems, 12Th International Conference (KES’08), 5178, pp. 117-124, (2008); Cardellini V., Colajanni M., Philip S.Y., Dynamic load balancing on web-server systems, Internet Comput IEEE, 3, 3, pp. 28-39, (1999); Casalicchio E., Cardellini V., Colajanni M., Content-aware dispatching algorithms for cluster-based web servers, Clust Comput, 5, 1, pp. 65-74, (2002); Cherkasova L., Ponnekanti S.R., Optimizing a “content-aware” load balancing strategy for shared Web hosting service, Modeling, Anal Simul Comput Telecomm Syst 2000.

Hard disk drive (HDD) has become popular for VOD storage to store and deal with a large amount of data. In practical cases, disk storage throughput is limited by a slow HDD and disk operating degrades drastically when the server needs to serve many simultaneous video streams. On the other hand, solid-state drive (SSD) are a appropriate features which does not has long access delay and support more IOPS that is greatly desirable for VOD storage. Unfortunately, using SSD to entirely replace HDD is not cost-effective. For this reason, hybrid storage is an economical way and offer better performance to treat with large scale VOD storage server. In this paper, SSD is divided into two different regions in size. The large part is used to store popular contents and the other is used as a buffer cache instead of RAM. The target of this research is to exploit fast access of SSD and its greater number of IOPS to maximize the number of simultaneously users and to minimize the service time. Experimental results of the proposed work enhance the response time for VOD storage server. © 2015 IEEE.","Disk bottleneck; Hybrid storage (HDD/SSD); Multimedia-on-demand (MOD); Video on demand (VOD); Video storage","Control systems; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Disks (machine components); Hard disk storage; Random access storage; Video streaming; Disk bottleneck; Hybrid storages; Multimedia on demand; Video on demands (VoD); Video storage; Video on demand","","","","","","","Kasavajhala V., Solid state drive vs. Hard disk drive price and performance study, Proc.

In our study there are many fields concern with numbers, for example, checks in banks or recognizing numbers in car plates, the subject of digit recognition appears. A system for recognizing isolated digits may be as an approach for dealing with such application. In other words, to let the computer understand the Arabic numbers that is written manually by users and views them according to the computer process. Scientists and engineers with interests in image processing and pattern recognition have developed various approaches to deal with handwriting number recognition problems such as, minimum distance, decision tree and statistics. Approach: The main objective for our system was to recognize isolated Arabic digits exist in different applications. For example, different users had their own handwriting styles where here the main challenge falls to let computer system understand these different handwriting styles and recognize them as standard writing. Result: We presented a system for dealing with such problem. The system started by acquiring an image containing digits, this image was digitized using some optical devices and after applying some enhancements and modifications to the digits within the image it can be recognized using feed forward back propagation algorithm. The studies were conducted on the Arabic handwriting digits of 10 independent writers who contributed a total of 1300 isolated Arabic digits these digits divided into two data sets: Training 1000 digits, testing 300 digits. An overall accuracy meet using this system was 95% on the test data set used. Conclusion: We developed a system for Arabic handwritten recognition. And we efficiently choose a segmentation method to fit our demands. Our system successfully designs and implement a neural network which efficiently go without demands, after that the system are able to understand the Arabic numbers that was written manually by users. © 2009 Science Publications.","ANN; Digital recognition; Feed forward back propagation algorithm; Neural network; Segmentation","","","","","","","","Tzanakou E.M., Classifiers: An Overview, from Supervised and Unsupervised Pattern Recognition: Feature Extraction and Computational Intelligence, (2000); Khorsheed M.S., Off-line Arabic character recognition-a review, Patt Anal, 5, pp. 31-45, (2002); Jurgen F., Isolated Handprinted Digit Recognition, Handbook of Character Recognition and Document Image Analysis, pp. 103-121, (1997); Alceu de Britto S., Sabourin R., Bortolozzi F., Ching Suen Y., The recognition of handwritten numeral strings using a two-stage HMM-based method, Int.

However, coping with object-oriented execution traces is a very difficult task. In particular, because of coupling, current object-oriented systems lead to form a very complicated interwoven lattice of dependencies which is known as ""Spaghetti Architectures"" phenomenon. Therefore, trace reduction techniques are used to make execution traces more tractable and less difficult. This research focuses on establishing a trace simplification framework that depends on decoupling. Decoupling is a very useful in reducing the complexity of execution traces for comprehension process. In particular, decoupling could truthfully lessen the problem of ""Spaghetti Architectures"" phenomenon without removing trace components and creating several holes and gaps in trace structure. For this purpose, a set of related challenges is posed and addressed in order to develop the framework properly. The framework is based on combination of three components namely, scope filtering, utility detection, and utility decoupling components. © 2017 IEEE.","decoupling; execution trace analysis; object-oriented; software comprehension; software maintenance","Computer software maintenance; Trace analysis; Comprehension process; decoupling; Decoupling components; Execution trace analysis; Object oriented; Object-oriented program; Object-oriented system; Software comprehension; Object oriented programming","","","","","","","Sommerville I., Software Engineering, (2011); SWEBOK V3 Software Engineering Body of Knowledge, (2012); Storey M.-A., Theories, tools and research methods in program comprehension: Past, present and future, Software Quality Journal, 14, pp. 187-208, (2006); Hamou-Lhadj A., Lethbridge T., Understanding the complexity embedded in large routine call traces with a focus on program comprehension tasks, Published in IET Softw, 4, 2, pp. 161-177, (2010); Dugerdil P., Repond J., Automatic generation of abstract views for legacy software comprehension, Proceedings of the 3rd India Software Engineering Conference, pp. 23-32, (2010); Webster B.F., Simon P., Why new systems fail, Course Technology, a Part of Cengage Learning, (2011); Cornelissen B., Evaluating Dynamic Analysis Techniques for Program Comprehension, (2009); Pirzadeh H., Trace Abstraction Framework and Techniques, (2012); Cornelissen B., Zaidman A., Van Deursen A., A controlled experiment for program comprehension through trace visualization, Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE).

It is also common to name both jackfruits. Computer vision and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) can provide an excellent solution to recognize the fruits. Although several studies have demonstrated the application of DCNN and transfer learning on fruits recognition system, previous studies did not solve two crucial problems; classification of fruit until species level, and comparison of pre-trained CNN in transfer learning. In this study, we aim to construct a recognition system for cempedak and nangka, and compare the performance of proposed DCNN architecture and transfer learning by five pre-trained CNNs. We also compared the performance of optimizers and three levels of epoch on the performance of the model. In general, transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 neural network provides higher performance for the dataset; the dataset performed better with an optimizer of SGD, compared with ADAM. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cempedak; Computer vision; Deep learning; Nangka; Optimization","","","","","","","","Grimm J.E., Steinhaus M., Characterization of the major odorants in Cempedak— Differences to jackfruit, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 68, 1, pp. 258-266, (2020); Balamaze J., Muyonga J.H., Byaruhanga Y.B., Physico-chemical characteristics of selected jackfruit (Artocarpus Heterophyllus Lam) varieties, Journal of Food Research, 8, 4, (2019); Shaha M., Pawar M., Transfer learning for image classification, In 2018 Second International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA) (Pp, pp. 656-660, (2018); Wang M.M.H., Gardner E.M., Chung R.C.K., Chew M.Y., Milan A.R., Pereira J.T., Zerega N.J.C., Origin and diversity of an underutilized fruit tree crop, cempedak (Artocarpus integer, Moraceae), American Journal of Botany, 105, 5, pp. 898-914, (2018); Yang F., Liang Z., Design of a low parasitic inductance SiC power module with double-sided cooling, IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC), 2017, pp. 3057-3062, (2017); Alhaj Y.A., Dahou A., Al-Qaness M.A., Abualigah L., Abbasi A.A., Almaweri N.A.O., Elaziz M.A., Damasevicius R., A novel text classification technique using improved particle swarm optimization: A case study of Arabic language, Future Internet, 14, 7, (2022); Daradkeh M., Abualigah L., Atalla S., Mansoor W., Scientometric analysis and classification of research using convolutional neural networks: A case study in data science and analytics, Electronics, 11, 13, (2022); Wu D., Jia H., Abualigah L., Xing Z., Zheng R., Wang H., Altalhi M., Enhance teaching-learning-based optimization for tsallis-entropy-based feature selection classification approach, Processes, 10, 2, (2022); Ali M.A., Balasubramanian K., Krishnamoorthy G.D., Muthusamy S., Pandiyan S., Panchal H., Mann S., Thangaraj K., El-Attar N.E., Abualigah L., Elminaam A., Classification of glaucoma based on elephant-herding optimization algorithm and deep belief network, Electronics, 11, 11, (2022); Abualigah L., Kareem N.K., Omari M., Elaziz M.A., Gandomi A.H., Survey on Twitter sentiment analysis: Architecture, classifications, and challenges, Deep Learning Approaches for Spoken and Natural Language Processing, pp. 1-18, (2021); Fan H., Du W., Dahou A., Ewees A.A., Yousri D., Elaziz M.A., Elsheikh A.H., Abualigah L., Al-Qaness M.A., Social media toxicity classification using deep learning: Real-world application UK Brexit, Electronics, 10, 11, (2021); Abualigah L.M.Q., Feature Selection and Enhanced Krill Herd Algorithm for Text Document Clustering, pp. 1-165, (2019); Hameed K., Chai D., Rassau A., A comprehensive review of fruit and vegetable classification techniques, Image and Vision Computing, 80, September, pp. 24-44, (2018); Rahnemoonfar M., Sheppard C., Deep count: Fruit counting based on deep simulated learning, Sensors (Switzerland), 17, 4, pp. 1-12, (2017); Reddy Chirra V.R., Uyyala S.R., Kishore Kolli V.K., Deep CNN: A machine learning approach for driver drowsiness detection based on eye state, Revue d’Intelligence Artificielle, 33, 6, pp. 461-466, (2019); Risdin F., Mondal P.K., Hassan K.M., Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for detecting fruit information using machine learning techniques, IOSR Journal of Computer Engineering, 22, 2, pp. 1-13, (2020); Abualigah L., Diabat A., Mirjalili S., Abd Elaziz M., Gandomi A.H., The arithmetic optimization algorithm, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 376, (2021); Abualigah L., Yousri D., Abd Elaziz M., Ewees A.A., Al-Qaness M.A., Gandomi A.H., Aquila optimizer: A novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 157, (2021); Abualigah L., Abd Elaziz M., Sumari P., Geem Z.W., Gandomi A.H., Reptile search algorithm (RSA): A nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimizer, Expert Systems with Applications, 191, (2022); Agushaka J.O., Ezugwu A.E., Abualigah L., Dwarf mongoose optimization algorithm, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 391, (2022); Oyelade O.N., Ezugwu A.E.S., Mohamed T.I., Abualigah L., Ebola optimization search algorithm: A new nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 16150-16177, (2022); Ezugwu A.E., Agushaka J.O., Abualigah L., Mirjalili S., Gandomi A.H., Prairie dog optimization algorithm, Neural Computing and Applications, pp. 1-49, (2022); Yang F., Liang Z., Design of a low parasitic inductance SiC power module with double-sided cooling, IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC), 2017, pp. 3057-3062, (2017)","L.

The blood vessels in the retina get altered and have abnormality. Exudates are secreted, micro-aneurysms and haemorrhages occur in the retina. The appearance of these features represents the degree of severity of the disease. Early detection of diabetic retinopathy plays a major role in the success of such disease treatment. The main challenge is to extract exudates which are similar in colour property and size of the optic disk, and then micro-aneurysms are similar in colour and proximity with blood vessels. The main objective of the paper is to develop a computer aided detection system to find the abnormality of retinal imaging and detects the presence of abnormality features from retinal fundus images. There is few existing research works have been undergone by applying machine learning techniques, but existing approaches have not achieved a good accuracy of detection and they have not yielded successful performance in different datasets. The proposed methodology is to enhance the image and filter the noise, detect blood vessel and identify the optic disc, extract the exudates and micro aneurysms, extract the features and classify different stages of diabetic retinopathy into mild, moderate, severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative Diabetic retinopathy (PDR) by using proposed machine learning methods. The expected output of proposed work in this paper will be a preliminary design and pilot prototype development. © 2016 IEEE.","diabetes; exudates; microaneurysm; segmentation and classification","Artificial intelligence; Blood vessels; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer aided instruction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Medical problems; Ophthalmology; Classification approach; Computer aided detection; Computer aided detection systems; exudates; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Microaneurysms; Eye protection","","","","","","","WHO, (2011); Yun L.W., Acharya U.R., Venkatesh Y.V., Chee C., Min L.C., Ng E.Y.K., Identification of different stages of diabetic retinopathy using retinal optical images, Information Sciences, 178, pp. 106-121, (2008); Liew G., Wong T., Mitchell P., Wang J.J., Retinal vascular imaging -A New Tool in Micro vascular disease Research, Advances in Cardiovascular Imaging, (2008); Jiang X., Mojon D., Adaptive local thresholding by verificationbased multi-threshold probing with application to vessel detection in retinal images, IEEE Trans. on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 25, 1, pp. 131-137, (2003); Niemeijer M., Van Ginneken B., Staal J., Suttorp-Schulten M., Abramoff M., Automatic detection of red lesions in digital color fundus photographs, Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on, 24, 5, pp. 584-592, (2005); Spencer T., Olson J.A., McHardy K.C., Sharp P.F., Forrester J.V., An image-processing strategy for the segmentation and quantification of micro aneurysms in fluorescein angiograms of the ocular fundus, Comput.

The difficulty of storing and fetching required data from data centers and servers will consequently increase. As a result, significant attention has been given to the flash memory-based solid state drive (SSD) from consumer electronics companies, which has begun to replace the existing hard disk drive and is highly likely to be used as a storage unit for most of consumer electronics to achieve low power consumption. In contrast to traditional disk, SSD uses semiconductor chips to store data. This structure enjoys original technical characteristics, including low power consumption, shock resistance, and high performance in random access. Such features can overcome the shortcomings of magnetic disks. However, flash memory, the basic unit of SSD, has many distinctive characteristics that cause various challenges. Flash memory does not support updating in the place method. A write operation can be performed only on an empty or erased unit, making the process more time-consuming. Moreover, each storage unit has a limited number of erase cycles, after which the block becomes invalid. This research proposes a new scheme called performance and reliability concern to increase the reliability and performance of SSDs. The eligibility of the proposed scheme is proven through EagleTree simulator. The scheme is also compared with other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides sufficient performance and reliability for SSD. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Consumer electronics; Digital storage; Electric power utilization; Flash-based SSDs; Hard disk storage; Reliability; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Electronics company; Garbage collection; Low-power consumption; Performance and reliabilities; Semiconductor chips; Solid state drives (SSD); State-of-the-art techniques; Flash memory","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PK-OMP/817066)","This work was supported in part by Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant No. (1001/PK-OMP/817066).

WMS involves several responsibilities, such as collection, disposal, and utilization of waste in relevant facilities. Efficient waste management has a considerable impact on the quality of life of citizens in smart cities. The interaction between wireless sensor networks and mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) with IoT provides excellent mobility for users, and reduces the deployment costs of networks. Data transfer via the intermediate connected devices must be maintained to shorten the distance between the devices. Intelligent routing algorithm is proposed to find efficient paths that comply with the WMS requirement constraints and avoid invalid paths that cause increased computation time. Chromosome intersection operation on genetic-based routing algorithm, intersection activation function, and intersection node table are proposed to avoid the similarity and redundancy of generated paths and keep the validity of the paths. This study improves the path finding, obtains good results, and increases the rate of efficient paths. Results show that the selected path is efficient in terms of distance, number of hops and number of iterations by using the proposed method. In addition, this proposed method outperforms DSR, which offers alternative paths with more efficiency. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

This paper presents an enhanced vocabulary-based dictionary algorithm for protecting web user by receiving unwanted spam mails. The proposed algorithm identifies and classifies legitimate incoming mails against unsolicited email attacks. We present a porter stemmer algorithm as a part of normalization process for removing the common morphological and inflexional endings from English words. A comparative study and evaluation of these classification approaches are carried out using machine-learning techniques. The performance of the proposed algorithm is visualized using confusion matrix. The experimental results show that our method produces less number of false negatives when compared with existing techniques. © 2016 IEEE.","dictionary approach; email classification; porter stemmer algorithm; text categorization","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Electronic mail; Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Classification approach; Comparative studies; Complete solutions; Confusion matrices; Email classification; Machine learning techniques; Normalization process; Text categorization; Text processing","","","","","","","Miszalska I., Zabierowski W., Napieralski A., Selected methods of spam filtering in email, CAD Systems in Microelectronics, 2007.

Load balancing aims at utilizing the resources efficiently, maximizing the throughput, and minimizing the request rejection rate. The peer-service area is the recent architecture for IPTV delivery networks that overcomes the flaws of the previous architectures. However, it still suffers from the load imbalance problem. This paper investigates the load imbalance problem, and tries to augment the peer-service area architecture to overcome this problem. To achieve the load balancing over the proposed architecture, we suggest a new load-balancing algorithm that considers both the expected and the current load of both contents and servers. The proposed load-balancing algorithm consists of two stages. The first stage is the contents replication according to their expected load, while the second stage is the content-aware request distribution. To test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we have compared it with both the traditional Round Robin algorithm and Cho algorithm. The experimental results depict that the proposed algorithm outperforms the two other algorithms in terms of load balance, throughput, and request rejection rate. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Content Distribution Network; Content replication scheme; IPTV; Load balancing algorithm; Peer-service area architecture; Request distribution; VoD","IPTV; Network architecture; Network management; Parallel architectures; Content distribution networks; Content replication; Load balancing algorithms; Request distributions; VoD; Algorithms","","","","","","","Borzemski L., Zatwarnicki K., CDNs with global adaptive request distribution, Proc. of the 12th Inter.

Since humans tend to use high-level semantic concepts when querying and browsing multimedia databases, there is an increasing need for semantic video indexing and analysis. For this purpose, we proposed a unified framework for semantic extraction retrieval with motion vector analysis and color tracking model in sports video and also focus on clustering by aggregating shots or key-frames with similar low-level features, the proposed scheme employs supervised learning to perform a top-down video shot classification. This paper also focuses on the integration of multimodal features for sport video structure analysis. In this paper stochastic modeling and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that can be efficiently applied to merge audio and visual cues. Currently our approach is validated in the particular domain of tennis videos. For initial analysis we undergone a pilot prototype study with existing works and added up proposed methods, based on results achieved we further need to enhanced the framework. We are now in the stage of analyzing and formulating the problem solution for implementation in matlab. © 2009 IEEE.","Component; Semantic extraction; Shot classification and HMM's","Digital storage; Electrical engineering; Feature extraction; Hidden Markov models; MATLAB; Object recognition; Stochastic models; Visual communication; Audio and visual cues; Color tracking; Digital media; High level semantics; Key-frames; Low-level features; Motion vector analysis; Multimedia database; Multimodal features; Semantic extraction; Semantic video indexing; Shot classification; Sport video; Sports video; Stochastic modeling; Tennis videos; Topdown; Unified framework; Video shot classification; Visual content; Semantics","","","","","","","Gong Y., Sin L.T., Chuan C.H., Zhang H., Sakauchi M., Automatic Parsing of TV Soccer Programs, Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems, pp. 167-174, (1995); Sudhir G., Lee J.C.M., Jain A.K., Automatic Classification of Tennis Video for High-level Content-based retrieval, Proc. of IEEE International Workshop on Content-Based Access of Image and Video Database, pp. 81-90, (1998); Ngo C.-W., Pong T.-C., Zhang H.-J., On clustering and retrieval of video shots, Proc. of ACM Multimedia, pp. 51-60, (2001); Assfalg J., Bertini M., Del Bimbo A., Nunziati W., Pala P., Soccer Highlights Detection and Recognition Using HMMs, Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo, 2002; Zhong D., Chang S.-F., Structure Analysis of Sports Video Using Domain Models, Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo, 2001; Assfalg J., Bertini M., Colombo C., Del Bimbo A., Semantic annotation of sports videos, IEEE Multimedia, 9, 2, pp. 52-60, (2002); Black M.J., Anandan P., The Robust Estimation of Multiple Motions: Parametric and Piecewise-smooth Flow Fields, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 63, 1, pp. 75-104, (1996)","V.

In this paper we present a method for a robust watermarking insertion in a video frame. The proposed method works on the uncompressed video based on the spread spectrum communication. The researchers applied the technique in the discrete wavelet transform domain (DWT). The results showed that the watermark has high perceptual invisibility and robust against JPEG compression, geometric distortions such as Downscaling, Cropping, and Rotation, as well as noising. The watermark was successfully extracted from the video after various attacks. © 2009 IEEE.","Data hiding; Geometric attacks; Video watermarking","Cellular telephone systems; Copyrights; Digital watermarking; Discrete wavelet transforms; Global system for mobile communications; Multimedia systems; Spectroscopy; Spread spectrum communication; Telecommunication equipment; Telecommunication systems; Visualization; Watermarking; Data hiding; Digital production; Digital video watermarking; Discrete wavelets; Down-scaling; Geometric attacks; Geometric distortion; JPEG compression; Perceptual invisibility; Robust watermarking; Various attacks; Video frame; Video watermarking; Watermarking techniques; Computer graphics","","","","","","","Voloshynovskiy S., Pereira S., Herrigel A., Baumgartner N., Pun T., Generalized watermarking attack based on watermark estimation and perceptual remodulation, Paper Presented at the Proceedings of SPIE 3971, (2000); Voloshynovskiy S., Pereira S., Pun T., Eggers J.J., Su J.K., Attacks on digital watermarks: Classification, estimation based attacks, and benchmarks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 39, 8, pp. 118-126, (2001); Karzenbeisser S., Perircolas F., Information hiding techniques for steganography and digital watermarking, Artech House., (2000); Li Y., Gao X., Ji H., A 3D wavelet based spatialtemporal approach for video watermarking, Proc. 5th Int.

Many optimization algorithms have been employed to address these kinds of problems. However, the algorithm’s performance substantially reduces with the increase in the scale and difficulty of problems. Various versions of the optimization methods have been proposed to address the engineering design problems in the literature efficiently. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the meta-heuristic optimization methods that have been used to solve engineering design problems is proposed. We use six main keywords in collecting the data (meta-heuristic, optimization, algorithm, engineering, design, and problems). It is worth mentioning that there is no survey or comparative analysis paper on this topic available in the literature to the best of our knowledge. The state-of-the-art methods are presented in detail over several categories, including basic, modified, and hybrid methods. Moreover, we present the results of the state-of-the-art methods in this domain to figure out which version of optimization methods performs better in solving the problems studied. Finally, we provide remarkable future research directions for the potential methods. This work covers the main important topics in the engineering and artificial intelligence domain. It presents a large number of published works in the literature related to the meta-heuristic optimization methods in solving various engineering design problems. Future researches can depend on this review to explore the literature on meta-heuristic optimization methods and engineering design problems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Algorithm;

Most of the developers use requirements elicitation techniques such as interviews, surveys but at the end of the day when developers develop application, the requirements are not met. The main goal of this study is to overcome the problem of requirement elicitation technique for web application using a combination of interview and Joint Application Development technique between developers and users. This technique will improve the requirement elicitation process and help developers and users to clearly define their requirements in web based application. We also anticipate this technique will decrease the time spent to develop a web application by using this combined technique. © 2016 IEEE.","Requirements elicitation; technique; web applications","Requirements engineering; Surveys; Combined techniques; Joint application development; Requirement elicitation; Requirements elicitation; Requirements elicitation techniques; technique; WEB application; Web-based applications; World Wide Web","","","","","","","Nora K., Gefei Z., Mar A.J., Model transformations from requirements to web system design, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Web Engineering, (2006); Ritu A., Jayesh P., Mohan T., John L., RisKs of rapid application development, Commun.

In this system, the video server employs staggered broadcasting protocol to disseminate video to mobile clients within the MANET environment. In this protocol, video is divided into small segments and are repeatedly broadcasted within server's channel in periodic basis. Clients can join any of the channels to receive the segments and begin to watch the video. The drawback of periodic broadcasting is it leads mobile clients to have a long waiting time (range in several minutes) due to the issue of channel transitions period. In this paper we focus on reducing the waiting time by proposing two caching schemes. This paper proposed first, a Neighbour-based caching scheme allows clients to get help from neighbour's buffer for the playback, and a Relay-based caching scheme uses middle clients to relay the video from client to another client. Simulation shows that our two caching schemes can reduce clients delay tremendously in comparison with the case of no caching scheme. © 2010 IEEE.","Mobile ad hoc; Periodic broadcast; Service delay; Video on demand system","Computer graphics; Mobile ad hoc networks; Video streaming; Visualization; Caching scheme; Channel transition; Hand held device; Mobile ad hoc; Mobile client; Mobile video; Periodic broadcasting; Periodic broadcasts; Service delays; Staggered broadcasting; Video on demand system; Video servers; Waiting-time; Video on demand","","","","","","","Tran D.A., Hua M.K., MobiVod: A video on demand system design for mobile ad hoc networks, Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM'04), pp. 118-126, (2004); Alzoubi K.M., Wan P.-J., Frieder O., Message-optimal connected dominating sets in mobile ad hoc networks, Proceedings of the 3rd ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking &amp (MobiHoc '02), pp. 157-164, (2002); Bajaj S., Breslau L., Shenker S., Uniform versus priority dropping for layered video, ACM SIGCOMM, pp. 131-143, (1998); Bradshaw M.K., Wang B., Sen S., Gao L., Kurose J., Shenoy P., Towsley D., Periodic broadcast and patching services - Implementation, measurement, and analysis in an internet streaming video testbed, Proceedings of the ACM International Multimedia Conference and Exhibition, 4, pp. 280-290, (2001); Cali F., Conti M., Gregori E., IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN: Capacity analysis and protocol enhancement, Proceedings of INFOCOM'98, pp. 142-149, (1998); Camp T., Boleng J., Davies V., A survey of mobility models for ad hoc network research, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2, 5, pp. 483-502, (2002); Carter S.W., Long D.D.E., Improving bandwidth efficiency of video-on-demand servers, Computer Networks and ISDN Systems, 31, 1, pp. 99-111, (1999)","P.

Content Distribution Networks (CDN) are used to solve this problem but the problem of load imbalance among servers still exists due to the dynamic changes in contents and user interests in an IPTV environment. In the VoD context, many content storage management architecture models are proposed: single point, hierarchal, distributed, and service peer area architectures. In the this paper we choose peer-service area architecture for CDN to study the load imbalance problem and try to handle it by modifying peer-service area architecture and proposing a balanced content allocation scheme that solves the load imbalance problem by replicating the contents based on their popularity. Experimental results show that this proposed allocation scheme can maintain the load balancing among servers and avoid over/under utilization of servers.","Balanced content allocation; CDN; Content allocation; Content popularity; IPTV; Load imbalance; Peer-service area architecture; VOD","","","","","","","","Bisdikian C., Patel B., Cost-based program allocation for distributed multimedia-on-demand systems, IEEE Multimedia, 3, 3, pp. 62-72, (1996); Cheng J., Report: One-third of TV watching to be video-ondemand by 2012, (2007); Cholvi V., Segarra J., Analysis and placement of storage capacity in large distributed video servers, Computer Communication, 31, 15, pp. 3604-3612, (2008); Cidon I., Kutten S., Soffer R., Optimal allocation of electronic content.

IPTV is a system that employs the high speed broadband networks to deliver TV services to the subscribers. From the service provider viewpoint, the challenge in IPTV systems is how to build delivery networks that exploits the resources efficiently and reduces the service cost, as well. However, designing such delivery networks affected by many factors including choosing the suitable network architecture, load balancing, resources waste, and cost reduction. Furthermore, IPTV contents characteristics, particularly; size, popularity, and interactivity play an important role in balancing the load and avoiding the resources waste for delivery networks. In this paper, we investigate the problem of resource allocation for IPTV delivery networks over the recent architecture, peer-service area architecture. The Genetic Algorithm as an optimization tool has been used to find the optimal provisioning parameters including storage, bandwidth, and CPU consumption. The experiments have been conducted on two data sets with different popularity distributions. The experiments have been conducted on two popularity distributions. The experimental results showed the impact of content status on the resource allocation process. Copyright © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Large-scale VOD servers need to provision a large number of concurrent requests with fast response time. However, improving the performance of VOD server has become so obstructive and limited due to high latency of the disk access and low I/O operation of the magnetic HDDs. By contrast, flash-based solid-state drive (SSD) has fast access reading and provides large I/O operation per second that makes it as an interesting alternative choice. Nevertheless, using SSD instead of the entire HDD is very expensive due to SSD costs high in price per gigabyte. Accordingly, combination of HDD and SSD can enhance the performance of the storage subsystem of a VOD server in a cost-effective way. In this paper, hybrid storage system (HSS) is proposed in VOD server in order to increase the number of simultaneous user requests and decrease startup latency in an economic way. The top 10% of popular videos are kept in SSD to exploit its fast access for read-intensive workloads. Our results show that the design of our proposed HSS produces high performance than the conventional VOD HDD-based server which the enhancement in the average total response times for all different request sizes by 65%. Also, the throughput is enhanced by 200%. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Hard Disk Drives (HDDs); I/O response time; Solid-State-Drive (SSD); Throughput; Video On Demand (VOD)","Cost effectiveness; Flash-based SSDs; Hard disk storage; Response time (computer systems); Concurrent requests; Cost effective; Fast response time; Hard disk drives; Hybrid storage systems; Storage subsystems; Total response; Video-on-demand servers; Video on demand","","","","","","","Zhao Y., Jiang H., Zhou K., Huang Z., Huang P., Meeting service level agreement cost-effectively for video-on-demand applications in the cloud, INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications, pp. 298-306, (2014); Al-wesabi O.A., Sumari P., Al-wesabi M.A., Proxy caching strategies for multimedia distribution, Int.

In addition, the targets may overlap in cluttered scenes. In this paper, a real-time and high-precision method was presented for detecting moving targets in cluttered scenes. The Gaussian Mixture Model was used to obtain the moving regions. Then, a set of morphological operations were applied to locate the candidate targets. Moreover, the areas smaller than the threshold were eliminated. The targets were detected using Histograms of Oriented Gradient features extracted from training images, AdaBoost Cascade Classifier and the trained Support Vector Machines. The key points on the target image were located, and the Weighted Euclidean Distance and Kalman Filter were used to track the targets. The results showed that the proposed method tracked the targets with approximately 90% precision within 500 frames video captured at different hours during a day.

This component consists of use hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and RAM, collectively fulfilling the requirement of simultaneous fast data access and large data distribution to numerous users. However, current hybrid storage systems still pose numerous challenges. The integration and roles of the HDD, SSD, and RAM are relatively weak in terms of optimizing fast access prior to streaming to a large number of simultaneous users. The HDD and SSD exhibit poor data layout and streaming controller in supporting the production of a high number of simultaneous streams. This paper proposes (1) the flash cache hybrid storage system (FCHSS) VOD servers. The FCHSS architecture has no RAM, which is removed and replaced by a flash-based SSD. (2) The new data layout stores thousands of video segments in the HDD and SSD. The streaming management scheme, namely, flash cache-data streaming controller (FC-DSC), is also proposed to support FCHSS. The proposed VOD server-based FCHSS with the FC-DSC shows a 73.53% and 23.71% enhancement in average total response time, and a 35.63% and 298.91% enhancement in throughputs for all request sizes compared with the average of the total response time and throughputs of the hybrid storage system HSS VOD server-and the VOD server-based feedback-based adaptive data migration (FADM). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Flash cache hybrid storage system (FCHSS); Flash cache-data streaming controller (FC-DSC); Hard disk drives (HDDs); I/O response time; Solid-state-drive (SSD); Throughput; Video on demand (VOD)","Controllers; Data reduction; Drives; Flash-based SSDs; Intelligent computing; Random access storage; Response time (computer systems); Storage management; Throughput; Video on demand; Cache data; Hard disk drives; Hybrid storage systems; Solid state drives (SSD); Video on demands (VoD); Hard disk storage","","","","","","","Al-Wesabi O.A., Sumari P., Al-Wesabi M.A., Proxy caching strategies for multimedia distribution, Int.

Throughout the years, EEG has contributed tremendously to data-driven research models (e.g., Generalised Linear Models, Bayesian Generative Models, and Latent Space Models) in Neuroscience Technology and Neuroinformatic. Due to versatility, portability, cost feasibility, and non-invasiveness. It contributed to various Neuroscientific data that led to advancement in medical, education, management, and even the marketing field. In the past years, the extensive uses of EEG have been inclined towards medical healthcare studies such as in disease detection and as an intervention in mental disorders, but not fully explored for uses in neuromarketing. Hence, this study construes the data acquisition technique in neuroscience studies using electroencephalogram and outlines the trend of revolution of this technique in aspects of its technology and databases by focusing on neuromarketing uses. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","And revolution; Consumer sciences; Eeg advancement; Eeg technology; Future VR-EEG integration; Neural signal processing; Neuromarketing","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","We would like to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for the support given to complete the manuscript.","Abujelala M., Sharma A., Abellanoza C., Makedon F., Brain-EE: Brain enjoyment evaluation using commercial EEG headband, Proceedings of the 9th ACM International Conference on, (2016); Beres A.

The main objective of this paper is to detect and segment the tumor from mammogram images that helps to provide support for the clinical decision to perform biopsy of the breast. In this paper, there are two aspects to segmentation in mammography. First is to separate out the mammogram from the background and the identification of putative masses and the pectoral muscle. The extraction approach is done using basic region growing method to identify the tumor. Second is to extract the features from segmented masses and classifies the masses by case base reasoning method. The experimental results are shown in this paper till the first phase of mass segmentation. © 2008 IEEE.","","Extraction; Mammography; Medical imaging; Tumors; X ray screens; Breast carcinomas; Case-base reasonings; Clinical decision; Digital mammograms; Feature extraction and classification; Mass segmentation; Region growing methods; Reliable methods; Image segmentation","","","","","","","Vyborny C.J., Giger M.L., Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence in Mammography, American Journal of Roentgenology, 162, pp. 699-708, (1994); Zhang W., Et al., An improved shift-invariant artificial neural network for computerized detection of clustered microcalcifications in digital mammograms, Medical Physics, 23, pp. 595-601, (1996); Brzakovic D., Et al., An approach to automated detection of tumors in mammograms, Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on, 9, pp. 233-241, (1990); Ballesteros F., Oropesa A., Martin L., Andida D., Mammography Classification Using Wavelets, Proceedings of 5th Biannual World Automation Congress, 13, pp. 293-300, (2002); Cheng H.D., Cui M., Mass Lesion Detection with a Fuzzy Neural Network, Pattern Recognition, 37, pp. 1189-1200, (2004); Otsu N., A threshold selection method from gray-level histograms, IEEE Trans System Man Cybernet, SMC-9, pp. 62-66, (1979); Xu W., Xia S., Duan H., A Novel Computer Aided Diagnosis System of the Mammogram, pp. 639-644, (2006)","V.

Depending on the variety, mango fruit can be varied in size, skin color, shape, sweetness, and flesh color which may be pale yellow, gold, or orange. However, sometimes it is difficult for us to differentiate what type of mango it is. Thus, in this paper, four types of mango classification approach is presented. Thus, we are going to use convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm and transfer learning methods (VGG16 and Xception) to train on the 1000 mango images collected and obtain a deep learning model which is able to classify four types of mango (Alampur Baneshan, Alphonso, Harum Manis and Keitt) automatically. In summary, the objective in this paper is to develop a deep learning algorithm to automatically classify four types of mango cultivar. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Convolutional neural network (CNN); Deep learning; DGG16; Mango; Transfer learning; Xception","","","","","","","","Alhaj Y.A., Dahou A., Al-Qaness M.A., Abualigah L., Abbasi A.A., Almaweri N.A.O., Elaziz M.A., Damasevicius R., A novel text classification technique using improved particle swarm optimization: A case study of Arabic language, Future Internet, 14, 7, (2022); Daradkeh M., Abualigah L., Atalla S., Mansoor W., Scientometric analysis and classification of research using convolutional neural networks: A case study in data science and analytics, Electronics, 11, 13, (2022); Wu D., Jia H., Abualigah L., Xing Z., Zheng R., Wang H., Altalhi M., Enhance teaching-learning-based optimization for tsallis-entropy-based feature selection classification approach, Processes, 10, 2, (2022); Ali M.A., Balasubramanian K., Krishnamoorthy G.D., Muthusamy S., Pandiyan S., Panchal H., Mann S., Thangaraj K., El-Attar N.E., Abualigah L., Elminaam A., Classification of glaucoma based on elephant-herding optimization algorithm and deep belief network, Electronics, 11, 11, (2022); Abualigah L., Kareem N.K., Omari M., Elaziz M.A., Gandomi A.H., Survey on Twitter sentiment analysis: Architecture, classifications, and challenges, Deep Learning Approaches for Spoken and Natural Language Processing, pp. 1-18, (2021); Fan H., Du W., Dahou A., Ewees A.A., Yousri D., Elaziz M.A., Elsheikh A.H., Abualigah L., Al-Qaness M.A., Social media toxicity classification using deep learning: Real-world application UK Brexit, Electronics, 10, 11, (2021); Alomari O.A., Khader A.T., Al-Betar M.A., Abualigah L.M., MRMR BA: A hybrid gene selection algorithm for cancer classification, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 95, 12, pp. 2610-2618, (2017); Alomari O.A., Khader A.T., Al-Betar M.A., Abualigah L.M., Gene selection for cancer classification by combining minimum redundancy maximum relevancy and bat-inspired algorithm, International Journal of Data Mining and Bioinformatics, 19, 1, pp. 32-51, (2017); Chung D.T.P., van Tai D., A fruit recognition system based on a modern deep learning technique, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1327, (2019); Andrea L., Mauro L., Di Ruberto C., A novel deep learning based approach for seed image classification and retrieval, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 187, (2021); Shaohua W., Guodos S., Faster R-CNN for multi-class fruit detection using a robotic vision system, School of Information and Safety Engineering, (2019); Osako Y., Et al., Cultivar discrimination of litchi fruit images using deep learning, Scientia Horticulturae, 269, (2020); Jaswal D., Vishvanathan S., Soman K.P., Image classification using convolutional neural networks, International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research, 5, 6, pp. 1661-1668, (2014); Abualigah L., Diabat A., Mirjalili S., Abd Elaziz M., Gandomi A.H., The arithmetic optimization algorithm, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 376, (2021); Abualigah L., Yousri D., Abd Elaziz M., Ewees A.A., Al-Qaness M.A., Gandomi A.H., Aquila optimizer: A novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 157, (2021); Abualigah L., Abd Elaziz M., Sumari P., Geem Z.W., Gandomi A.H., Reptile search algorithm (RSA): A nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimizer, Expert Systems with Applications, 191, (2022); Agushaka J.O., Ezugwu A.E., Abualigah L., Dwarf mongoose optimization algorithm, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 391, (2022); Oyelade O.N., Ezugwu A.E.S., Mohamed T.I., Abualigah L., Ebola optimization search algorithm: A new nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 16150-16177, (2022); Ezugwu A.E., Agushaka J.O., Abualigah L., Mirjalili S., Gandomi A.H., Prairie dog optimization algorithm, Neural Computing and Applications, pp. 1-49, (2022); Diahashree G., Transfer Learning and the Art of Using Pre-Trained Models in Deep Learning, (2017); Transfer Learning in Keras Using VGG16, (2020)","L.

Designing an automatic and intelligent system for early diagnosis can prevent the blindness in infants.However, the blood vessels in the retina of infants is less clear, hence the correct diagnosis of vessels is very difficult. In this study, first the pre-processing stage removes the noise of images, after that the images are divided into 16 × 16 windows and Gabor filter is applied to each sub-window. Energy and entropy are calculated for each sub-window, and finally these features are sent into a neural networkto determine whether the sub-window has a vessel or not.By counting the number of sub-windows containing vessel, the prematurenessand completeness of retina is determined. In this method, the mean accuracy of images that have been classified is 80.88% respectively.","Gabor filters; Retinal vessel extraction; Retinopathy of premature infants","","","","","","","","McRitchie I.N., Hart P.M., Winder R.J., Image registration and subtraction for the visualization of change in diabetic retinopathy screening, Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, 30, pp. 139-145, (2006); Yun W.L., Rajendra Acharya U., Venkatesh Y., Chee C., Min L.C., Ng E., Identification of different stages of diabetic retinopathy using retinal optical images, Information sciences, 178, pp. 106-121, (2008); Matsopoulos G.K., Asvestas P.A., Delibasis K.K., Mouravliansky N.A., Zeyen T.G., Detection of glaucomatous change based on vessel shape analysis, Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, 32, pp. 183-192, (2008); Castillo-Riquelme M.C., Lord J., Moseley M.J., Fielder A.R., Haines L., Cost-effectiveness of digital photographic screening for retinopathy of prematurity in the United Kingdom, International journal of technology assessment in health care, 20, pp. 201-213, (2004); Chaudhuri S., Chatterjee S., Katz N., Nelson M., Goldbaum M., Detection of blood vessels in retinal images using twodimensional matched filters, IEEE Trans on Med.

In this proposed work, a Pre-Stored Cloudlet is introduced. Pre-stored Cloudlet is where the Cloudlet is pre-stored with encoded game videos in it transmitted from the Main Cloud. The main drawbacks of the existing Mobile Cloud Gaming (MCG) are long distances between the Cloud and mobile users, strongly dependent on network, it consumes high bandwidth and causes latency. We proposed a system architecture to overcome the existing problem in MCG by introducing Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc mobile network into the architecture of MCG. Ad Hoc mobile network is formed within the range of Pre-Stored Cloudlets to enable the users to get the pre-rendered game videos from the nearby users. The proposed system has THREE main layers; Cloud, Cloudlet and mobile users and the video transmission is expected to happen between these layers aided with WiMax and WiFi connection. The architecture is implemented through simulation and it is simulated to find the Response Delay which consist of Network Delay, Processing Delay, and Playout Delay. Based on the simulation results obtained, it shows that the introduction of Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc environment has helped to decrease the latency in game video transmission. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ad Hoc; Cloudlet; Mobile Cloud Gaming; Network Delay; Playout Delay; Processing Delay; Response Delay","Computer architecture; Image communication systems; Intelligent computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Ad Hoc; Cloudlet; Mobile clouds; Network delays; Playout delay; Processing delay; Response delays; Mobile ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Srivastava P., Khan R., A review paper on cloud computing, Int.

In general, the multimedia techniques consist of instant messages, audio, and video chatting services. However, users cannot phonetically communicate with each other unless they use the same chatting applications since each chatting application has its own control protocol to handle the call setup, the real time media transmission, and the call teardown sessions. The only way to enable the users to communicate phonetically using different chatting applications is to design a new architecture by proposing an interworking module between the control protocols used by the applications. The interworking module between at least two different protocols is a very critical issue as it solves the data transmission problems when using different chatting applications to create a voice call, and demonstrates that the voice conferencing between heterogeneous control protocols identifies the interest of combining the features and taking the advantages of more than one protocol in a single network. The two chosen protocols in this paper are: Inter-Asterisk exchange Protocol and the extension of extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol. Each protocol differs from the other one in many terms. Thus, this paper clarified the main differences between IAX Protocol and Jingle Protocol by doing a comparison in terms of registration, URI format, signals, transport methods, audio and control packets, bandwidth, scalability, functionality, services, etc. This comparison is due to define the common and the unique features to ease proposing the IAX-Jingle mapping architecture, signaling and media transfer modules. So, people around the world will be enabled to talk with each other without caring whether they are IAX or Jingle users.","IAX; Jingle; Multimedia; Signaling Protocols; VoIP","","","","","","","","Goode B., Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Proceedings of the IEEE, pp. 1495-1517, (2002); Aliwi H.S.H., Sumari P., A comparative study of VoIP protocols, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security (IJCSIS).

Basically, VoD consists of a video server, interconnection network and user display equipment (UDE). It provides a similar service to the neighbourhood rental store. Videos or movies are distributed from the video server to users upon request through the network and users can view interactively using their UDE along with VCR-like functions (e.g. forward, rewind, pause and resume). VoD offers a convenient service since users do not have to leave their homes, which also leads to shorter response times than with today's video stores. One important aspect of any VoD is the storage scheme used, which affects the amount and type of storage required, the maximum number of concurrent video streams and the average waiting time experienced by users of the service from the moment they choose a video to the moment video playback starts. The paper reviews some well known storage schemes, such as the phase based method and the phase based with replication method, and then proposes two new schemes that further increase the number of concurrent streams and reduce the waiting time, while reducing the total storage space required. These new schemes rely on two concepts called immediate playback RAM and sustainable playback storage. Using a case study, the new schemes are briefly compared with an existing scheme and their strengths and shortcomings are highlighted. Using some typical values, analyzes are carried out that quantify the performance gain resulting from the new storage schemes.","","Client server computer systems; Computer systems programming; Interconnection networks; Random access storage; Response time (computer systems); Telecommunication services; Videocassette recorders; User display equipment (UDE); Video on demand","","","","","","","Chang Y., II.

VOD provides a service to users to browse and to watch any videos at any time. One of the most challenging aspects in designing VOD system is to design a data storage for VOD server with a capability of retrieving and transmitting different blocks of videos simultaneously to support simultaneous streams. Real time and latency characteristics are the major hurdles in devising server’s data storage for producing maximum number of simultaneous streams as well as reducing the average service waiting time. In this paper we present a new data storage scheme for VOD server that eliminates latency and hence producing maximum number of simultaneous streams. The scheme introduces a disk-region layout technique on an array of disks. The disk-region layout uses a residue class theory concept for overall mechanism of disk partition and data distribution within disks. We also present our approach of stream caching in minimizing the average service waiting time of the system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.","","Cluster computing; Computation theory; Digital storage; Grid computing; Data distribution; Data storage; Disk partitions; Electronic video rental service; Residue class; Theory concept; Video on demands (VoD); Video-on-demand servers; Video on demand","","","","","","","Chang E., Garcia-Molina H., Reducing Initial Latency in Media Servers, IEEE Multimedia, pp. 50-61, (1997); Chang C.K., Shih C.-C., A circular skip-cluster scheme to support video-ondemand services, Multimedia System, 7, 2, pp. 107-118, (1999); Chua T.S., Li J., Ooi B.C., Tan K.L., Disk Stripping Strategies for Large Videoon- Demand Servers, The 4Th ACM International Multimedia Conference, Boston, MA, pp. 297-306, (1996); Srivastava A., Kumar A., Singru A., Design and Analysis of a Video-on-demand Server, Multimedia Systems, 5, 4, pp. 238-254, (1997); Furht B., Kalra D., Kitson F.L., Rodriguez A.A., Wall W.E., Design Issues for Interactive Television Systems, Computer, 28, 5, pp. 25-39, (1995); Gemmell D.J., Vin H.M., Kandlur D.D., Rangan P.V., Rowe L.A., Multimedia Storage Server: A Tutorial, Computer, 28, 5, pp. 40-49, (1995); Ghandeharizadeh S., Kim S.H., Shahabi C., On Configuring a Single Disk Continuous Media Server, SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation, Ottawa Ontario Canada, 23, 1, pp. 37-46, (1995); Liu J.C., Du D., Schnepf J.A., Supporting random access on real-time retrieval of digital continuous media, Computer Communications, 18, 3, pp. 145-159, (1995); Li V., Liao W., Distributed multimedia system, Proceeding of the IEEE, 85, 7, pp. 1063-1108, (1997); Ozden B., Rastogi R., Silberschatz A., On the design of a low-cost video-ondemand storage system, Multimedia System, 4, 1, pp. 40-54, (1996); Rotem D., Zhao J.L., Buffer Management for Video Database Systems, Proceeding of the 11Th Int.
