Though early diagnosis is critical for successful treatment of the disease, immediate reaction in cases of emergency is crucial significance in saving the lives of stricken. Previous studies on patient-centric healthcare indicate that both the patient's whereabouts and the locality of the healthcare centers play a vital role at moment of crisis. Not only it is important for a patient to be able to find the nearest healthcare points, it is also necessary for the emergency centers to know the exact location of the patient seeking for help. To this end, a Location-Based Mobile Cardiac Emergency System (iHeart) is proposed, which is a patient-centric healthcare system, to monitor and track the patient via a wearable device and their mobile phones. Therefore, this study aims to find healthcare professional's opinion and to find success factors of such a system before its full implementation. A survey was conducted in the form of questionnaire in Malaysia and Iran. In order to conduct the survey, a conceptual model was proposed based on DeLone and McLean Information Success Model. A total number of 323 data was collected from both countries. The results were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS software. Multi-group comparison was applied to find differences in points of view from both countries. The results of this study revealed the success factors of iHeart before the full implementation. It was found that nationality plays a moderating role between some of the success factors and success of iHeart. The success of a patient-centric healthcare system is bound to the culture of a particular nation as well as to the technological advancements, facilities, and the needs of the target users, meaning that in order for a novel healthcare system to be publicly acknowledged and utilized; target users must be classified and assessed accordingly. The findings of the present study are highly beneficial to both patients suffering from Coronary Heart Disease and the healthcare providers that seek to utilize new patient-centric healthcare systems, devices, and electronic applications to rescue patients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Emergency; Location-based; Mobile healthcare; Multi-group comparison; Nationality; Patient-centric; Success model","Cardiology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Health care; Heart; Location; mHealth; Surveys; Emergency; Location based; Multi-group; Nationality; Patient-centric; Success models; Cellular telephone systems","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","The research is done at the expense of the prestigious USM Fellowship Scheme granted in 2013 to Pantea Keikhosrokiani to pursue her Doctoral studies in Service System Engineering at School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia.

As the population increases, the necessity for healthcare services also increase which includes healthcare for heart patients. Heart diseases have become one of the leading causes of death. We have to take the correct precaution beforehand in order to avoid problems later on in future. Nowadays, many people are not willing to seek for medical help until their heart related conditions has worsened. Thus, Mobile Healthcare Locator System for Heart Patients (MMHLSHP) is proposed with the intention to save the patients in critical situations as w ell as m improve healthcare services for heart patients during emergency. The objective of MHLSHP is mainly tr track and show the patient's current location and to locate the nearest healthcare point, and assist in reaching to the nearest Emergency Center (EC) to seek for medical help. The location coordinates of the healthcare points can be retrieved by Global Positioning System (GPS). Using location-based services (LBS), it will provide us the exact locations of the nearest healthcare center. This paper provider the system design and architecture for MHLSHIP together with system and unit tests of the proposed system. The results indicate that MHLSHP is indeed a beneficial emergency locator system, which will enable the critical heart patients or their caregiver to locate the nearest healthcare points and inform the nearest emergency centers. The notification on emergencies will be relayed to the EC, in order for them to take immediate actions, for example, sending an ambulance to the patient's current location. The design of the proposed system can provide useful prospect for healthcare providers to enhance and develop such kind of healthcare system for heart patients. © 2016 IEEE.","Global positioning system; Heart disease; Location-based services; Smartphone; Wireless technology","Cardiology; Diseases; Global positioning system; Health care; Heart; Information science; Location; Telecommunication services; Tracking (position); Wireless telecommunication systems; Causes of death; Health care providers; Health-care system; Healthcare services; Heart disease; Heart patients; Mobile health care; Wireless technologies; Location based services","","","","","","","Ho F., Healthy hearts, The Star Online, (2013); Shahar F.M., UiTM: Malaysians at high risk of heart disease, New Straits Times Online, (2014); Kappiarukudil K.J., Ramesh M.V., Real-time Monitoring and Detection of ""Heart Attack"" Using Wireless Sensor Networks, pp. 632-636, (2010); Fong E.M., Chung W.Y., Mobile Cloud-computing-based Healthcare Service by Noncontact ECG Monitoring, pp. 16451-16473, (2013); Keikhosrokiani P., Et al., A Proposal to Measure Success Factors for Location-based Mobile Cardiac Telemedicine System (LMCTS), pp. 57-66, (2012); Subudhi S.K., Sivanandam S., Intelligent Wireless Monitoring and Tracking System, pp. 97-104, (2014); Sundaram P., Patient Monitoring System Using Android Technology, pp. 191-201, (2013); Hande A., Polk T., Et al., Self-powered Wireless Sensor Networks for Remote Patient Monitoring in Hospitals, pp. 1102-1117, (2006); Trappey C.V., Et al., Develop Patient Monitoring and Support System Using Mobile Communication and Intelligent Reasoning, pp. 1226-1231, (2009); Mercer E., Bluetooth Technology in Health Care, (2009); Understanding Blood Pressure Readings, (2016); Keikhosrokiani P., Et al., E-torch: A Mobile Commerce Location-based Promotion System, pp. 140-159, (2013); Mathew G., Showing Nearby Places and Place Details Using Google Places API and Google Maps Android API V2, (2013); Danalet A., Et al., A Bayesian approach to detect pedestrian destination-sequences from wifi signatures, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, (2014); Honsi T., Highcharts - Create Interactive Charts Easily for Your Web Projects, (2015)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd International Conference on Computer and Information Sciences, ICCOINS 2016","15 August 2016 through 17 August 2016","Kuala Lumpur","125433","","978-150905134-2","","","English","Int.

One of the main concerns of MHS is adoption with new technologies. Since there are various cultures along with different distinguished boundaries, MHS users will behave inconsistently in order to accept the new technologies. In line with this, it is tried to examine cultural effects on the acceptance of MHS and compare it with some other user’s characters such as age and gender. In this regard, uncertainty avoidance (UA), which is one of the dimensions of national culture that was provided by Hofstede, has been used to detect the influence of culture on the acceptance of MHS. For this purpose, a survey questionnaire was distributed among smartphone users in three countries including Iran, Malaysia, and America among developing and developed countries to determine users’ behavior with different national culture backgrounds in interaction with MHS. Trust and anxiety are used as user acceptance factors in order to check whether UA has a significant relationship with user acceptance or not. In addition to descriptive analysis, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is applied to verify the influence of national culture on trust and anxiety. If culture plays a significant role in the process of the acceptation, MHS providers can use this information to evade culturally related problems for future projects. © 2015 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","","","Abelson J., Miller F.A., Giacomini M., What does it mean to trust a health system?

These data are exposed to various types of cyberattacks, one of which is advanced persistent threats (APTs). APTs are stealthy and focus on sophisticated, specific targets. One reason for the detection failure of APTs is the nature of the attack pattern, which changes rapidly based on advancements in hacking. The need for future researchers to understand the gap in the literature regarding APT detection and to explore improved detection techniques has become crucial. Thus, this systematic literature review (SLR) examines the different approaches used to detect APT attacks directed at the network system in terms of approach and assessment metrics. The SLR includes papers on computer, mobile, and internet of things (IoT) technologies. We performed an SLR by searching six leading scientific databases to identify 75 studies that were published from 2012 to 2022. The findings from the SLR are discussed in terms of the literature's research gaps, and the study provides essential recommendations for designing a model for early APT detection. We propose a conceptual model known as the Effective Cyber Situational Awareness Model to Detect and Predict Mobile APTs (ECSA-tDP-MAPT), designed to effectively detect and predict APT attacks on mobile network traffic. © 2023 The Authors","APT malware; Attack behaviour; Intrusion detection system; Machine learning; Network traffic; Situation awareness model","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/ICT07/USM/02/2); Mustansiriyah University","This work is supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with project code FRGS/1/2020/ICT07/USM/02/2.

Previous studies have shown that on-line discussion spaces have helped readers across the globe to co-construct their interpretations of a text. The increasing popularity of digital writing has prompted the book industry—that is publishers, book seller and libraries—to take close heed of readers’ writings and responses in order to improve book suggestions, offer personalized book recommendations and increase their sales. The purpose of this study is to propose an analytical model to examine the dominant feeling in public’s reaction to a text. To achieve this goal, the study focuses on readers’ feedback in Goodreads website on Long Litt Woon’s memoir The Way Through the Woods: Of Mushrooms and Mourning (2017). To carry out this study, this project uses a text mining technique that employs sentiment analysis using VADER and TextBlob. The results of opinion mining shows 89 positive sentiments, 5 neutral, and 28 negative sentiments using VADER whereas TextBlog results depicts 99, 5, 18 for positive, neutral, and negative sentiments respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Goodreads; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Text analytics; The Way Through the Woods: On Mushrooms and Mourning","Data mining; Digital libraries; Sentiment analysis; Book industry; Case-studies; Computer-mediated technology; Goodread; Negative sentiments; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Text analytics; Text mining techniques; The way through the wood: on mushroom and mourning; Fungi","","","","","","","Malik E.F., Keikhosrokiani P., Asl M.P., Text mining life cycle for a spatial reading of Viet Thanh Nguyen’s the refugees (2017), 2021 International Congress of Advanced Technology and Engineering (ICOTEN), Pp. 1–9, (2021); Ying S., Keikhosrokiani P., Asl M., Comparison of data analytic techniques for a spatial opinion mining in literary works: A review paper, IRICT 2020.

The existing defect detection methods are still not good enough for detecting small target defects; therefore, the algorithm in this paper proposes an improved algorithm for PCB defect detection based on the RetinaNet model. The ResNet-D residual structure and efficient channel focus module are introduced in the model backbone network to enhance its feature extraction capability and achieve the purpose of improving the detection accuracy. At the same time, the method replaces the original multi-step learning decay strategy with a cosine annealing scheduling learning strategy, which optimizes the training process of the model. Finally, the performance of the method is verified on the publicly available PCB defect dataset from the Open Laboratory of Intelligent Robotics, Peking University. The experimental results show that the algorithm improves the mAP value by 3.2% compared with the original algorithm, while the fastest detection speed reaches 36.9 FPS, which can effectively improve the defect detection performance of PCB. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Channel attention; Defect detection; RetinaNet","Feature extraction; Learning systems; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Quality control; Channel attention; Defect detection; Defect detection method; Defect size; Electronic industries; Industry products; PCB defects detections; Product quality control; Retinanet; Small targets; Defects","","","","","Fujian Provincial Leading Project, (2019H0025); Government Guiding Regional Science and Technology Development, (2019L3009); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Cyber-Physical Systems, (2020B1212060069); National&Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Manufacturing Cyber-Physical Systems; Open Fund Project of Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61972187); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, (2019J01756, 2020J02024, 2020Y4018, 2021J011016); Minjiang University, MJU, (MJUKF-IPIC202106)","Acknowledgments.

Over the past few years and with the rapid advancements in social media platforms, readers around the world have publicly shared their opinions and feelings towards the text using online platforms such as Twitter, Goodreads, Facebook-among many others. The huge bulk of readers' reviews are useful data for publishers and booksellers in analyzing readers' interests to recommend similar texts to online readers. The analysis of sentiment and emotion attached to this data can help to determine the popularity or unpopularity of a literary text. Using reader-reviews of Hamid's novel from Goodreads as the main data source, this study a offers a data analytic approach: LSTM, LDA to detect and classify the dominant emotion existing within the readers' feedback. Understanding readers' emotions towards the novel can help in developing a recommendation system that can suggest readers stories of their interest. © 2023, IGI Global.

During COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation and fake news outbreak increased as social media platforms play important role to enable people to view, search, and share the news as well as their point of view globally. Social media users might find difficulties in checking the validity of the news as they could not differentiate which one are the authorized news. Thus, it is too risky if people could easily be swayed by believing the news without validation. Therefore, the goal of this research is to classify the news related to COVID-19 using topic modeling and clustering. Latent Dirichlet Allocation is used for topic modeling of the fake and real news. This study can increase the awareness among social media users to reduce the risk of believing and sharing the misinformation especially during COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Multicast has the potential to optimize network performance and support scalable distributed applications without compromising performance, efficiency, and QoS but introduces new challenges to transmit multicast packet in the backbone especially when incorporated into wireless mesh network with limited bandwidth. We propose ROHC enabled tunnel for source specific multicast architecture that will compress packet header and aggregate them to together in a frame to save bandwidth and address the packet loss. Our ROHC enabled tunneling protocol will act as SSM channel (S, G) and is designed to be deployed in the backbone network. In this paper, we analyze and discuss the how to address the bandwidth efficiency and packet loss with respect to our proposed tunneling protocol. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","IPv6; ROHC; Source-specific multicast; Tunneling protocol; VOIP","Bandwidth; Engineering technology; Internet protocols; Internet telephony; Materials science; MESH networking; Multicasting; Network performance; Packet loss; Video streaming; Voice/data communication systems; IPv6; ROHC; Source specific multicast; Tunneling protocol; VOIP; Network architecture","","","","","","","Piri E., Pinola J., Fitzek F., Pentikousis K., ROHC and aggregated VoIP over fixed WiMAX: An empirical evaluation, Proc.

The risk factors of this deadly disease are due to some bad habits such as being overweight, bad eating diet, smoking, assumption of alcohol, etc. Nevertheless, patients can live a healthy lifestyle if they have the proper guidance of persuasive-emotional featured technologies. In line with this, this study focuses on developing an emotional-persuasive habit-change support mobile application called BeHabit to improve heart disease patients’ lifestyles. Persuasive-emotional features are two different features that are integrated with BeHabit to distinguish this application from the existing ones. The proposed system is designed, implemented, tested, and evaluated by 10 users. In conclusion, the users are satisfied to used BeHabit to change their bad habits. Emotional and persuasive features that are integrated into BeHabit are the key to help patients to change their bad habits. BeHabit and the integrated feature can be used as a guideline for healthcare developers and providers for the improvement of mHealth services.

This study proposes an artificial intelligence lifecycle for opinion mining of the dominant sentiments, topics, and emotions in Boochani's social media activism. Sentiment analysis (Vader and Textblob), topic modelling (LDA and NMF), and emotion detection are performed to extract hidden sentiments, topics, and emotions from the data that is collected from his tweets from 20I7-202I. The results show Vader performs better than Textblob. LDA is considered the best algorithm.

One of the main causes of obesity is bad lifestyle habits such as unhealthy eating habits, sedentary behavior, low physical activity, as well as individual susceptibility. Obesity can cause serious chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, breast cancer, and so forth. Therefore, this chapter focuses on developing a web-based hospital data analytics system to monitor obese patients' unhealthy lifestyle habits related to diet, exercise, and sleep as well as patient's physiological data such as heart rate. In addition, the proposed system is able to predict obese patient's future lifestyle habit using machine learning models. Based on the predictive results, doctor and nutritionist can advise proper prescriptions to assist patient to change unhealthy lifestyle habits. The proposed system is developed, tested, and evaluated by users. As prevention of disease is better than secure with medicine, the proposed system can be useful to monitor and predict obese patient's lifestyle habits for preventing them from chronic disease. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

This chapter proposes an analytical framework of topic modelling and sentiment analysis for exploring the connection between theme, place, and sentiment in 36 autobiographical narratives by or about women from the Middle East. In the proposed framework, a latent Dirichlet allocation and latent semantic analysis algorithm from topic modelling, TextBlob library for sentiment analysis are employed to detect the place names that come together and to point out the associated themes and emotions throughout the data source. The model gives a scoring of each topical clusters and reveals that the diasporic authors are more likely to write about their hometown than their current host land. The authors hope that the merging of topic modelling and sentiment analysis would be beneficial to literary critics in the analysis of long texts. © 2023, IGI Global.

Higher education institutions also faced the same threat since BYOD has been adopted into their institution. In this paper, a simulation on watering hole attack and spear phishing; comparison between these two APT variants, as well as the survey design based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) are presented. The result of the survey is analyzed using PLS-SEM. The result demonstrated that severity factor and vulnerability factor moderately explained the Protection Behaviour factor; and Protection Behaviour factor is a moderately strong predictor to self-efficacy, but avoidance behavior does not predict self-efficacy directly. Based on this result, a set of security policy for hindering watering hole and spear phishing attack is designed and implemented. The new policy will then be adapted to the university e-learning portal. © 2018 The Authors.","Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD); Cyber Crime; Smartphone; Watering Hole","Crime; Education; Information systems; Surveys; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Bring your own devices; Cyber-crimes; Higher education institutions; Protection motivation theory; Security strategies; Vulnerability factors; Watering Hole; Computer crime","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) No : 203/PKOMP/6711424 of under the Universiti Sains Malaysia and Government of Malaysia.","Bichsel J., Dahlstrom E., Ecar Study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology, (2014); Bann L.L., Singh M.M., Samsudin A., Trusted security policies for tackling advanced persistent threat via spear phishing in byod environment, Procedia Computer Science, 72, pp. 129-136, (2015); Zulkei Z., Mahinderjit-Singh M., Malim N., AdvancedPersistentThreatMitigationUsingMultiLevelSecurity AccessControlFramework, Vol. 9158 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 90-105; Herath T., Rao H.R., Protection motivation and deterrence: A framework for security policy compliance in organisations, European Journal of Information Systems, 18, 2, pp. 106-125, (2009); Dang-Pham D., Pittayachawan S., Comparing intention to avoid malware across contexts in a byod-enabled Australian university: A protection motivation theory approach, Computers & Security, 48, pp. 281-297, (2015); Vance A., Siponen M., Pahnila S., Motivating is security compliance: Insights from habit and protection motivation theory, Information & Management, 49, 3, pp. 190-198, (2012); Pillay A., Diaki H., Nham E., Senanayake S., Tan G., Deshpande S., Does Byod Increase Risks or Drive Benefits?; La Polla M., Martinelli F., Sgandurra D., A survey on security for mobile devices, IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 15, 1, pp. 446-471, (2013); Krombholz K., Hobel H., Huber M., Weippl E., Advanced social engineering attacks, Journal of Information Security and Applications, 22, pp. 113-122, (2015); Spear-phishing Email: Most Favored Apt Attack Bait (Research Paper), (2012); Rogers R.W., A protection motivation theory of fear appeals and attitude change, The Journal of Psychology, 91, 1, pp. 93-114, (1975); Boer H., Seydel E.R., Protection Motivation Theory; Guel M.D., Information Security Policy Templates, (2010); CISCO, Byod in Education; the Cisco Bring-Your-Own-Device Solution for Education: Getting Mobile Devices Simply and Securely Connected; Emery S., Factors for Consideration When Developing A Bring Your Own Device (Byod) Strategy in Higher Education, (2012); Kline R.B., Book review: Psychometric theory, Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment, 17, 3, pp. 275-280, (1999); Damballa, Advanced Persistent Threats (Apt): A Brief Description; Roche X., Httrack Website Copier-Free Software Oine Browser (Gnu Gpl), (2007); Google, Google Url Shortener (N.d.); Kee C.K., Security policy roadmap-process for creating security policies, Sans Institute Electronic Library Available Online at Sourced on the 29th, Citeseer; Ladle D., Bring Your Own Device Policy Nottingham Trent University 1.0, 6, (2012)","M.M.

Healthcare professionals present major challenges to the successful implementation of IoT for providing healthcare services. Many studies have offered important insights into IoT adoption in healthcare. Nevertheless, there is still a need to thoroughly review the effective factors of IoT adoption in a systematic manner. The purpose of this study is to accumulate existing knowledge about the factors that influence medical professionals to adopt IoT applications in the healthcare sector. This study reviews, compiles, analyzes, and systematically synthesizes the relevant data. This review employs both automatic and manual search methods to collect relevant studies from 2015 to 2021. A systematic search of the articles was carried out on nine major scientific databases: Google Scholar, Science Direct, Emerald, Wiley, PubMed, Springer, MDPI, IEEE, and Scopus. A total of 22 articles were selected as per the inclusion criteria. The findings show that TAM, TPB, TRA, and UTAUT theories are the most widely used adoption theories in these studies. Furthermore, the main perceived adoption factors of IoT applications in healthcare at the individual level are: social influence, attitude, and personal inattentiveness. The IoT adoption factors at the technology level are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, performance expectancy, and effort expectations. In addition, the main factor at the security level is perceived privacy risk. Furthermore, at the health level, the main factors are perceived severity and perceived health risk, respectively. Moreover, financial cost, and facilitating conditions are considered as the main factors at the environmental level. Physicians, patients, and health workers were among the participants who were involved in the included publications. Various types of IoT applications in existing studies are as follows: a wearable device, monitoring devices, rehabilitation devices, telehealth, behavior modification, smart city, and smart home. Most of the studies about IoT adoption were conducted in France and Pakistan in the year 2020. This systematic review identifies the essential factors that enable an understanding of the barriers and possibilities for healthcare providers to implement IoT applications. Finally, the expected influence of COVID-19 on IoT adoption in healthcare was evaluated in this study. © 2022 by the authors.","adoption factors; adoption theories; deep learning (DL); Internet of Things in healthcare; IoMT; IoT; IoT adoption; machine learning (ML); systematic review","COVID-19; Delivery of Health Care; Health Personnel; Humans; Telemedicine; Wearable Electronic Devices; Automation; Deep learning; Health care; Health risks; Medical computing; Adoption factors; Adoption theory; Deep learning; Internet of thing in healthcare; IoMT; IoT; IoT adoption; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Systematic Review; electronic device; health care delivery; health care personnel; human; procedures; telemedicine; Internet of things","","","","","Division of Research & Innovation, Universiti Sains Malaysia; Office of Research & Sponsored Programs of Abu Dhabi University; School of Computer Sciences","This research is funded by the Office of Research & Sponsored Programs of Abu Dhabi University, United Arab Emirates, and the School of Computer Sciences, and Division of Research & Innovation, Universiti Sains Malaysia.","Chiuchisan I., Costin H.N., Geman O., Adopting the internet of things technologies in health care systems, Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference and Exposition on Electrical and Power Engineering (EPE), pp. 532-535; Mani V., Manickam P., Alotaibi Y., Alghamdi S., Khalaf O.I., Hyperledger Healthchain: Patient-Centric IPFS-Based Storage of Health Records, Electronics, 10, (2021); Keikhosrokiani P., Mustaffa N., Zakaria N., Success factors in developing iHeart as a patient-centric healthcare system: A multi-group analysis, Telemat.

It can be used in different ways like mapping, navigation, tourism development, etc. The purpose of the study is to develop a GIS-based application to improve the tourism experience in Terengganu. A multi-step method was used to develop the GIS-based application in this study. The first step is planning the data field and selecting hardware and software. The next step is data acquisition which collects data for the area of interest and stores the data into a local database. Data validation is done to prevent system or result error. Then, the database is designed and analyzed to determine the most suitable database model and apply Dijkstra's algorithm in the system. Finally, GIS is developed, and the analyzed data is overlaid on the map to give the tourist a clear picture or information on the tourists' area of interest by displaying more detailed attributes. © 2021 IEEE.","Dijkstra's Algorithm; Geographic Information System; Location-based Services; Mobile Application; Tourism","Data acquisition; Database systems; Tourism; Area of interest; Data validation; Database modeling; Dijkstra's algorithms; Hardware and software; Mobile applications; Multi step methods; Tourism development; Geographic information systems","","","","","School of Humanities; University of Southern Maine, USM, (203/PHUMANITI/6711709)","The authors are thankful to the School of Computer Sciences, USM for providing the resources and unlimited support to complete this study.

This study aims to identify the different types of violence represented in selected literary works from the country. To this end, an artificial intelligence approach-comprised of opinion mining and hybrid machine learning models-is developed as a method of analysis. The Afghan American writer Khaled Hosseini's novels-The Kite Runner (2003), A Thousand Splendid Suns (2007), and And the Mountains Echoed (2017)-are used as primary data sources. As a theoretical framework, the study benefits from the Norwegian sociologist Johan Galtung's theory of conflict triangle-direct violence, structural violence, and cultural violence. To classify the sentiments related to types of violence in the selected novels, the study utilizes sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms. © 2023, IGI Global.

Various studies related to obesity have been done; however, there is still a need to predict the possibility of losing obese patient's weight based on history of his/her diet and exercise data. Therefore, this study use an obese patient as the case study. Diet and exercise data was collected using Smartwatch. This study classifies the obese patient's level of possibility to lose weight to high (Good health), medium (Normal) and low (Poor health) from the patient's diet and exercise data. Machine learning techniques such as k-nearest neighbour and decision tree are used in this study to classify the diet and exercise data and find out the level of possibility to reduce weight. Analysis of this study shows that the decision tree provides the best accuracy for diet and exercise data where it is recorded 71.54% and 63.63% respectively. On the other hand, k-nearest neighbour shows the accuracy of 65.85% for diet and 69.32% for exercise data. The prediction results of this study can be used by the doctors and physicians to provide better advice and prescription for the obese patients. © 2021 IEEE.","Classification; Decision Tree; Diet; Exercise; Habit Change; K-Nearest Neighbour; Machine Learning; mHealth; Obesity","Decision trees; Forecasting; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Nutrition; Coronary heart disease; K-nearest neighbours; Machine learning techniques; Respiratory disorders; Weight loss; Trees (mathematics)","","","","","Division of Research & Innovation; University of Southern Maine, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315435)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors are thankful to the School of Computer Sciences, and Division of Research & Innovation, USM for providing financial support from the Short Term Grant (304/PKOMP/6315435).","Jardine G., Obesity and dietary behavioural changes, Journal of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes of South Africa, 15, 2, pp. 88-90, (2010); Keikhosrokiani P., Perspectives in the Development of Mobile Medical Information Systems: Life Cycle, Management, Methodological Approach and Application (Perspectives in the Development of Mobile Medical Information Systems: Life Cycle, Management, Methodological Approach and Application), pp. 1-273, (2019); Augustine C.A., Keikhosrokiani P., A habit-change support web-based system with big data analytical features for hospitals (doctive), Cham, pp. 91-101, (2021); Ravichandran B.D., Keikhosrokiani P., An emotional-persuasive habit-change support mobile application for heart disease patients (behabit), Cham, pp. 252-262, (2021); Haslam D.W., James W.P.T., Obesity, The Lancet, 366, 9492, pp. 1197-1209, (2005); Keikhosrokiani P., Chapter 6-emotional-persuasive and habitchange assessment of mobile medical information systems (mmis), Perspectives in the Development of Mobile Medical Information Systems, pp. 101-109, (2020); Rautiainen I., Ayramo S., Predicting Overweight and Obesity in Later Life from Childhood Data: A Review of Predictive Modeling Approaches, (2019); Santorelli G., Et al., Developing prediction equations and a mobile phone application to identify infants at risk of obesity, PLoS One, 8, 8, (2013); Graversen L., Et al., Prediction of adolescent and adult adiposity outcomes from early life anthropometrics, Obesity, 23, 1, pp. 162-169, (2015); Weng S.F., Redsell S.A., Nathan D., Swift J.A., Yang M., Glazebrook C., Estimating overweight risk in childhood from predictors during infancy, Pediatrics, 132, 2, (2013); Morandi A., Meyre D., Lobbens S., Kleinman K., Kaakinen M., Estimation of newborn risk for child or adolescent obesity: Lessons from longitudinal birth cohorts, PLoS ONE, 7, 11, pp. 49919-49919, (2012); Redsell S.A., Weng S., Swift J.A., Nathan D., Glazebrook C., Validation, optimal threshold determination, and clinical utility of the infant risk of overweight checklist for early prevention of child overweight, Childhood Obesity, 12, 3, pp. 202-209, (2016); Druet C., Et al., Prediction of childhood obesity by infancy weight gain: An individual-level meta-analysis, Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology, 26, 1, pp. 19-26, (2012); Watts A.W., Masse L.C., Naylor P.J., Changes to the school food and physical activity environment after guideline implementation in British Columbia, Canada, International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, 11, 1, (2014); Lindvall K., Et al., Comparisons of weight change, eating habits and physical activity between women in northern Sweden and rural New York state-results from a longitudinal study, Nutrition Journal, 14, 1, (2015); Romeike K., Abidi L., Lechner L., De Vries H., Oenema A., Similarities and differences in underlying beliefs of socio-cognitive factors related to diet and physical activity in lower-educated Dutch, Turkish, and moroccan adults in the netherlands: A focus group study, BMC Public Health, 16, 1, (2016); Hattar A., Hagger M.S., Pal S., Weight-loss intervention using implementation intentions and mental imagery: A randomised control trial study protocol health behavior, health promotion and society, BMC Public Health, 15, 1, (2015); Farran B., AlWotayan R., Alkandari H., Al-Abdulrazzaq D., Channanath A., Thanaraj T.A., Use of non-invasive parameters and machine-learning algorithms for predicting future risk of type 2 diabetes: A retrospective cohort study of health data from Kuwait, Frontiers in Endocrinology, 10, (2019); Dunstan J., Bastias M., Nau C., Glass T.A., Tobar F., Predicting Nationwide Obesity from Food Sales Using Machine Learning, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2021 International Congress of Advanced Technology and Engineering, ICOTEN 2021","4 July 2021 through 5 July 2021","Virtual, Online","170704","","978-166541224-7","","","English","Int.

The Wearable Health Monitoring System (WHMS) is used to manage and monitor chronic disease in elderly people, postoperative rehabilitation patients and persons with special needs. Location-aware healthcare is achievable as positioning systems and telecommunications have been developed and have fulfilled the technology needed for this kind of healthcare system. In this paper, the researchers propose a Location-Based Mobile Cardiac Emergency System (LMCES) to track the patient's current location when Emergency Medical Services (EMS) has been activated as well as to locate the nearest healthcare unit for the ambulance service. The location coordinates of the patients can be retrieved by GPS and sent to the healthcare centre using GPRS. The location of the patient, cell ID information will also be transmitted to the LMCES server in order to retrieve the nearest health care unit. For the LMCES, we use Dijkstra's algorithm for selecting the shortest path between the nearest healthcare unit and the patient location in order to facilitate the ambulance's path under critical conditions. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.","Cardiac emergency services; Dijkstra's algorithm; Global positioning system; Location-based services; Mobile healthcare; Remote patient monitoring; Telemedicine","Ambulances; Emergency services; Global positioning system; Health care; Location; Medical computing; mHealth; Patient rehabilitation; Remote patient monitoring; Telemedicine; Ambulance services; Critical condition; Dijkstra's algorithms; Emergency medical services; Health-care system; Positioning system; Postoperative rehabilitations; Wearable health-monitoring systems; Location based services","","","","","","","Ren-Guey L., Kuei-Chien C., Chun-Chieh H., Chwan-Lu T., A mobile care system with alert mechanism, Information Technology in Biomedicine, IEEE Transactions on, 11, pp. 507-517, (2007); Pattichis C.S., Kyriacou E., Voskarides S., Pattichis M.S., Istepanian R., Schizas C.N., Wireless telemedicine systems: An overview, Antennas and Propagation Magazine, IEEE, 44, pp. 143-153, (2002); Lin C.-F., Mobile telemedicine: A survey study, Journal of Medical Systems, pp. 1-10, (2010); Espinoza F., Persson P., Sandin A., Nystrom H., Cacciatore E., Bylund M., GeoNotes: Social and Navigational Aspects of Location-Based Information Systems, (2001); Kizhakkepurayil S., Jeon-Yeoul O., Lee Y., Sobh T., Mobile Application for Healthcare System - Location Based Innovations and Advances in Computer Sciences and Engineering, pp. 297-302, (2010); Lin C.-F., Lee H.-W., Wireless multimedia communication toward mobile telemedicine, Proceedings of the 9th WSEAS International Conference on Applied Informatics and Communications, pp. 232-237, (2009); Pattichis C.S., Kyriacou E., Voskarides S., Pattichis M.S., Istepanian R., Schizas C.N., Wireless telemedicine systems: An overview, Antennas and Propagation Magazine, IEEE, 44, pp. 143-153, (2002); Pantelopoulos A., Bourbakis N.G., A survey on wearable sensor-based systems for health monitoring and prognosis, Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, IEEE Transactions on, 40, pp. 1-12, (2010); Fahim Sufi Q.F., Khalil I., Mahmoud S.S., Novel methods of faster cardiovascular diagnosis in wireless telecardiology, Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on, 27, pp. 537-552, (2009); Maglogiannis I., Hadjiefthymiades S., EmerLoc: Location-based services for emergency medical incidents, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 76, pp. 747-759, (2007); Chew S.H., Chong P.A., Gunawan E., Goh K.W., Kim Y., Soh C.B., A hybrid mobile-based patient location tracking system for personal healthcare applications, Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, 2006.

First, a local threshold segmentation is performed on red and blue components in RGB color space to determine the general area of the boarding pass. Then, edge detection is performed on the blue component and pixel value standardization statistics on the three components to obtain partial edges and internal information of the boarding pass to refine the binary image. Next, the watershed algorithm is used to achieve precise positioning of the boarding pass. Finally, the segmentation and the boarding pass are completely rectified through perspective transformation. The results of segmentation and correction of boarding passes in actual scenarios show that the proposed algorithm can complete segmentation and correction under complex conditions such as boarding pass images sticking to each other, uneven illumination, and large-angle tilt. The average time spent on the test set is 0.049s, and the segmentation and correction success rate is 95.16 %. The proposed algorithm has high application value. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Boarding pass positioning; Jointly multi-channel; Perspective transformation; Threshold segmentation","Edge detection; Image segmentation; RGB color model; Boarding pass; Boarding pass positioning; Correction algorithms; Image sticking; Image tilt; Jointly multi-channel; Multi channel; Perspective transformation; Positioning algorithms; Threshold segmentation; Binary images","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61972187); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, (2020J01828, 2020J02024, 2022J011112)","Acknowledgment.

Knowledge workers face a high mental workload in terms of planning and coordination. One solution is to predict the mental workload of knowledge workers. Some machine learning models have been implemented for mental workload prediction, but deep learning models are yet to be introduced for this purpose. Deep learning models are superior to machine learning models because of their ability to correct inaccurate predictions if they ever occur. Therefore, this study aims to optimize the extreme learning adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ELANFIS) by integrating particle swarm optimization into a micro-genetic algorithm to predict the mental workload of knowledge workers. Although the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) shows reasonable prediction performance, it also suffers from the curse of dimensionality and has a poor computation time. Thus, ELANFIS is introduced because its curse of dimensionality is less severe when solving problems with a high number of input dimensions. The integration of the advantages of a micro-genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization is suggested to optimize the premise parameters of ELANFIS, as this can allow better solutions to be located at a faster rate. The proposed model yields promising prediction results, with improvements of 6.0665 in the Mean Squared Error(MSE) and 1.279 in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for regression; the proposed model even surpasses the prediction results of ELANFIS optimized with PSO alone, with improvements of 1.5369 in MSE and 0.4094 in RMSE for regression. The findings are expected to assist employers in determining an appropriate working lifestyle for their employees. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Behavior Recognition; Deep Learning; Genetic Algorithms; NeurofuzzyNetworks; Optimization; Particle Swarm Algorithms; Regression","Deep learning; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Human resource management; Inference engines; Knowledge management; Mean square error; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Curse of dimensionality; Knowledge workers; Machine learning models; Mean squared error; Micro genetic algorithm; Prediction performance; Root mean squared errors; Learning systems","","","","","Division of Research & Innovation; RCMO; School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia; University of Southern Maine, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315435)","Funding text 1: The authors are thankful to School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia for unlimited supports to publish this paper.

In order to develop a useful m-Commerce system, user need must be considered. In addition, m-Commerce adoption must be assessed among users before the final development of the system. In order to use m-Commerce a set of skills and knowledge is required among Smartphone users. For this reason, a Five Dimensions m-Commerce Literacy (5DmCL) Model is developed in this study first. Then a survey is conducted to discover how m-Commerce Literacy can affect Smartphone users’ attitude towards using m- Commerce. e-Torch, a mobile commerce location-based promotion system was used as a case study for conducting the survey. The survey was conducted among 124 Smartphone users in Penang, Malaysia using questionnaire. To analyse the collected data, a theoretical framework called the Model of m-Commerce Literacy on Attitude (mCLoA) is proposed in order to understand the Smartphone users’ attitude towards using e-Torch for enhancing the quality of m-Commerce services. Partial Least Squares (PLS) is utilized to analyse the proposed measurement model. For this reason, validity and the structural equation modelling (SEM) technique is utilized in order to assess the proposed model. The results indicated that respondents with more m-Commerce Literacy show positive attitude towards using e-Torch and they trust on this kind of m- Commerce system. Moreover, they believe that e-Torch is useful and easy to use for advertisement services and it can improve the quality of m- Commerce. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte.

The advent of the metaverse will have a profound influence on consumer behavior, from how people make decisions and create brand connections to how they feel about their avatar embodiment and their purchases in the metaverse. The Handbook of Research on Consumer Behavioral Analytics in Metaverse and the Adoption of a Virtual World investigates the social, behavioral, and psychological factors that influence metaverse adoption. The focus then shifts to concepts, theories, and analytical approaches for detecting changes in consumer behavior in the metaverse. Covering topics such as e-commerce markets, user experience, and immersive technologies, this major reference work is an excellent resource for business executives, entrepreneurs, data analysts, marketers, advertisers, government officials, social media professionals, librarians, students and educators of higher education, researchers, and academicians. © 2023, IGI Global.

In recent years, many methods for feature matching have been proposed. However, the image alignment algorithm used in the state-of-the-art matching method is not robust enough, and the number of the features extracted from the images are insufficient, thus the performance obtained by the state-of-the-art matching method is unsatisfactory. To address these issues, firstly, we use a more robust geometric estimation algorithm to align image pairs. Secondly, based on aligned image pairs, we design a content-aware block to more focus on effective features by using a feature extractor and a mask predictor. Experimental results show that our method achieves more superior results, and outperforms several classical and deep learning methods on the HPatches dataset. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Content-aware; Feature matching; Image alignment","Learning systems; Content-aware; Critical steps; Estimation algorithm; Features matching; Image alignment; Image alignment algorithm; Image pairs; Matching methods; Performance; State of the art; Deep learning","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61972187, 62172197); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, (2020J02024)","Acknowledgement.

Analyzing the huge amount of data posted online is an arduous task for literary scholars who use traditional methods to understand readers and viewers’ responses to creative works of art. This study offers a data science approach for opinion mining and detecting embedded emotions in people’s comments. To achieve this goal, a Machine Learning Model Classifier is developed to analyze embedded emotions in public responses to the movie adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s Crazy Rich Asians on YouTube. A total of 41,161 comments posted before or on 27 December 2021 are collected using the YouTube Data API. An emotion classifier with Incremental Learning Approach is built to detect emotions associated with the comments. The built emotion classifier showed accuracy ranging from 84% to 93%. The findings reveal that most of the comments are associated with the emotions of curiosity, love, and surprise. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Crazy Rich Asians; Emotion Detection; Incremental Learning; Machine Learning; Opinion Mining; Text Analytics","Data mining; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Cinematics; Crazy rich asian; Emotion detection; Incremental learning; Machine-learning; Opinion mining; Singapore; Social media; Text analytics; YouTube; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Asri M.A.Z.B.M., Keikhosrokiani P., Asl M.P., Saeed F., Mohammed F., Ghaleb F., Opinion mining using topic modeling: A case study of Firoozeh Dumas’s Funny in Farsi in goodreads, IRICT 2021.

However, the existing studies still need a comprehensive review highlighting the vital machine, and Deep learning techniques for the automatic health information evaluation process. Objective: Therefore, this study outlines the most recent developments and the current state of the art regarding evaluating the quality of online health information on web pages and specifies the direction of future research. Methods: In this article, a systematic literature is conducted according to the PRISMA statement in eight online databases PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, ACM, Springer Link, Wiley Online Library, Emerald Insight, and Web of Science to identify all empirical studies that use machine and deep learning models for evaluating the online health information quality. Furthermore, the selected techniques are compared based on their characteristics, such as health quality criteria, quality measurement tools, algorithm type, and achieved performance. Results: The included papers evaluate health information on web pages using over 100 quality criteria. The results show no universal quality dimensions used by health professionals and machine or deep learning practitioners while evaluating health information quality. In addition, the metrics used to assess the model performance are not the same as those used to evaluate human performance. Conclusions: This systemic review offers a novel perspective in approaching the health information quality in web pages that can be used by machine and deep learning practitioners to tackle the problem more effectively. © The Author(s) 2023.","deep learning; Machine learning; online health information; quality assessment; quality metrics","algorithm; artificial intelligence; benchmarking; data base; data quality; deep learning; empiricism; health practitioner; human; machine learning; medical information; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; quality control; review; SpringerLink; systematic review; Web of Science","","","","","Hadhramout Establishment for Human Development Foundation; School of Computer Science USM","Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is funded by the Hadhramout Establishment for Human Development Foundation, Yemen, Hadhramout. ; Funding text 2: The authors are thankful to the School of Computer Science USM for all the support they provide and to the Hadhramout Establishment for Human Development Foundation for funding this work.

As an example, the Vietnamese-American writer Viet Thanh Nguyen's short story collection The Refugees (2017) has received opposing critical receptions: Whereas some critics applaud the stories for their truthful representations of the two countries, others criticize them for their biased depictions. This study aims to demonstrate how text mining can offer a more objective analysis of the representation of the two main countries in the selected stories. We propose a Big Data Analytics lifecycle that consider two empirical methods. The first method used N-grams, while the second method propose sentiment analysis using lexicon dictionary.

In recent years, the Booker Prize awarding committee has faced challenges in selecting books that are more readable and popular. This study suggests that one feasible way to address this issue is to analyze readers’ response and public reaction to literary works in social media. In this regard, the present study aims to develop a data analytics technique that can analyze literary readers’ responses in Twitter and predict a potential prize winner. To achieve this focal goal, a Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling approach is designed to classify the public reactions to The Booker Prize nominees in Twitter. The data is extracted for three consecutive years of 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, the study utilizes Machine Learning to propose a prediction technique in selecting the best possible Booker Prize winner based on public opinion. The results reveal the main topics frequently appearing in the data as well as the positive and negative sentiments attached to them. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Booker prize; Clustering; Opinion mining; Reader response; Sentiment analysis; Topic modelling; Twitter","Data Analytics; Data mining; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Booker prize; Case-studies; Clusterings; Data analytics; Literary works; Opinion mining; Reader response; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Topic Modeling; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Roberts G., Prizing Literature, (2018); Squires C., Book marketing and the booker prize, Judging a Book by Its Cover: Fans, Publishers, Designers, and the Marketing of Fiction, pp. 71-82, (2007); Moseley M., On the man booker prize, Sewanee Rev, 125, 2, pp. 296-309, (2017); Asl M.P., Gender, space and counter-conduct: Iranian women’s heterotopic imaginations in Ramita Navai’s city of Lies: Love, sex, death, and the search for truth in Tehran, Gender Place Cult, (2021); Jordison S., What Happened?

SPS detects occupancy of each car park and concurrently display the number of vacant spaces and directional signage to the available car parks on the display boards. In order to assess user acceptance level toward using SPS, a research model is proposed by combining three different research theories which are Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). An online survey with 150 respondents has been conducted to evaluate the user acceptance level based on perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), subjective norm (SN) and performance expectancy (PE) variables.

IoT-based technologies transform medical decision-making by offering various services such as transmitting medial data/biomedical signals, patient tracking and remote monitoring, reliable access to medical data, and quick emergency services. Although, there are many benefits in merging new IoT technologies with telemedicine, the role of IoT in medical and technical decision-making is not clear enough for medical professionals. Therefore, this chapter aims to perform a systematic review of the relevant literature to elucidate various IoT applications for enhanced medical and technical decision-making. Electronic database search is performed to obtain the studies from 2017 to 2021 using search strategies. IEEE Xplore and PubMed are included for database search. Around 272 papers were selected from searching strategies. While reviewing the title of those papers, filtration was applied, and some papers were removed. Among all papers, only 73 journal articles which only focus on the role of IoT for medical decision-making were included in this study. ATLAS.ti was used for coding, qualitative analysis and visualization of the included papers to extract the relevant information to this study. IoT-based techniques were highlighted and their role in the enhancement of medical and technical decision were discussed. This chapter can be useful for healthcare providers for using relevant IoT-based solutions for providing better decision-making for medical information systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Internet of things; Medical decision-making; Medical information systems; Qualitative analysis; Systematic review","","","","","","Division of Research and Innovation; RCMO; University of Southern Maine, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315435)","Acknowledgements The author is thankful to School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for unlimited supports.

The risk factors of this deadly disease are due to some bad habits such as being overweight, bad eating diet, smoking, assumption of alcohol, etc. Nevertheless, patients can live a healthy lifestyle if they have the proper guidance of persuasive-emotional featured technologies. In line with this, this study focuses on developing an emotional-persuasive habit-change support mobile application called BeHabit to improve heart disease patients’ lifestyles. Persuasive-emotional features are two different features that are integrated with BeHabit to distinguish this application from the existing ones. The proposed system is designed, implemented, tested, and evaluated by 10 users. In conclusion, the users are satisfied to used BeHabit to change their bad habits. Emotional and persuasive features which are integrated into BeHabit are the key to help patients to change their bad habits. BeHabit and the integrated feature can be used as a guideline for healthcare developers and providers for the improvement of mHealth services. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Emotional features; Habit-change; Heart disease; Medical information system; mHealth; Mood; Persuasive","Cardiology; Health care; Mobile computing; Risk perception; Bad habits; Healthy lifestyles; Heart disease; M-health services; Mobile applications; Risk factors; Diseases","","","","","Division of Research & Innovation; University of Southern Maine, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315435)","Acknowledgment.

The murmur sound happens at the Lub-Dub, which indicates there are abnormalities in the heart. However, using the stethoscope for listening to the heartbeat sound requires a long time of training then only the physician can detect the murmuring sound. The existing studies show that young physicians face difficulties in this heart sound detection. Use of computerized methods and data analytics for detection and classification of heartbeat sounds will improve the overall quality of sound detection. Many studies have been worked on classifying the heartbeat sound; however, they lack the method with high accuracy. Therefore, this research aims to classify the heartbeat sound using a novel optimized Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inferences System (ANFIS) by artificial bee colony (ABC). The data is cleaned, pre-processed, and MFCC is extracted from the heartbeat sounds. Then the proposed ABC-ANFIS is used to run the pre-processed heartbeat sound, and accuracy is calculated for the model. The results indicate that the proposed ABC-ANFIS model achieved 93% accuracy for the murmur class. The proposed ABC-ANFIS has higher accuracy in compared to ANFIS, PSO ANFIS, SVM, KSTM, KNN, and other existing studies. Thus, this study can assist physicians to classify heartbeat sounds for detecting cardiovascular disease in the early stages. © The Author(s) 2023.","adaptive neuro-Fuzzy inferences system; artificial bee colony; classification; Heartbeat sound; optimization","","","","","","Division of Research & Innovation; Division of Research & Innovation, Universiti Sains Malaysia; School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315435)","Funding text 1: The authors are thankful to the School of Computer Sciences, and Division of Research & Innovation, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for supporting this study from the Short-Term Grant (304/PKOMP/6315435) granted to Dr Pantea Keikhosrokiani. ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by Short-Term Grant (304/PKOMP/6315435).

This empirical study aims to assess the interaction between human and iHeart. In line with this, a survey was conducted among healthcare professional in two cities of Isfahan and Penang to find how intention to “Use” of iHeart and “User satisfaction” conveys the role of effective factors [Information Quality (IQ), Service Quality (SQ), System Quality (SysQ), Trust (Tr), Anxiety (Ax), and mHealth Literacy (mHL)] to the “Success of Human Interaction (SHI)” with iHeart. The total number of 323 respondents returned the questionnaire. Using DeLone and McLean IS success model, a conceptual model was developed to identify the mediating effects of “Use” and “User satisfaction”. Covariance-based structural equation modelling was applied for data analysis using the statistical software AMOS. In this study, mediation effect was examined in three different methods including Baron and Kenny, Sobel test, and Bootstrapping technique. The most reliable results are from bootstrapping technique, which indicate that “Use” mediates the effects of SysQ, Tr, and mHL on SHI. In addition, “User satisfaction” is a mediator between SysQ, SQ, and mHL with SHI. Ultimately, IQ has direct effect on SHI without involvement of mediator. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Assessment; Human–computer interaction; Medical information system; mHealth; Success; Use; User satisfaction","Bioinformatics; Human computer interaction; Information analysis; Information use; mHealth; Statistical methods; Surveys; Assessment; Computer interaction; Health care professionals; Information quality; Statistical software; Structural equation modelling; Success; User satisfaction; Medical information systems","","","","","National Advanced IPv6 Centre of Excellence, (Nav6); Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors are grateful to School of Computer Sciences and Institute of Postgraduate Studies, Universiti Sains Malaysia for the prestigious USM Fellowship Scheme granted to Pantea Keikhosrokiani to pursue her Doctoral studies in Service System Engineering.

Location-based services can be used in mobile cardiac telemedicine systems to improve efficiency, robustness and accuracy. This paper proposes a combination of mobile telemedicine systems and location-based services that will enable hospitals and emergency departments to do continuous monitoring of a patient's heart activity; such a system would decrease the probability of critical condition patients in emergency cases and increase the chance of saving lives. In order to evaluate whether this kind of health care system might work, we explore the success factors for such a system by adapting the DeLone & McLean IS success model to the context of location-based mobile system in cardiac healthcare. After reviewing previous works, we identify fourteen factors which can affect the success of a location-based mobile cardiac telemedicine system: Realization of user expectations, Portability, Accessibility, Extent of data processing, Time response, Urgency, Currency, Sufficiency, Understandability, Reliability, Extent of Mobility (spatial, temporal, contextual), System support, Responsiveness, and Assurance. We apply these factors to propose a success model for our location-based mobile cardiac telemedicine system.","Cardiac telemedicine system; DeLone & McLean IS success model; IS success; Location-based services; Mobile communication","Blood pressure; Data processing; Health care; Hospitals; Location based services; Telemedicine; Continuous monitoring; Critical condition; Emergency departments; Health-care system; IS success; IS success model; Location based; Medical emergency; Mobile communications; Mobile systems; Mobile telemedicine system; Patient's heart; Success factors; Success models; System supports; Telemedicine systems; Time response; Understandability; User expectations; Heart","","","","","","","Lin C.-F., Mobile Telemedicine: A Survey Study, Journal of Medical Systems, pp. 1-10, (2010); Kizhakkepurayil S., Jeon-Yeoul O., Lee Y., Sobh T., Mobile Application for Healthcare System - Location Based Innovations and Advances in Computer Sciences and Engineering, pp. 297-302; Fahim Sufi Q.F., Khalil I., Mahmoud S.S., Novel methods of faster cardiovascular diagnosis in wireless telecardiology, Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on, 27, pp. 537-552, (2009); Telemedicine: A Guide to Assessing Telecommunications for Health Care, (1996); Delone W.H., Mclean E.R., The DeLone and McLean Model of Information Systems Success: A Ten-Year Update, Journal of Management Information Systems, 19, pp. 9-30, (2003); Delone W.H., Mclean E.R., Information System Success: The Quest for Dependent Variable, Information System Research, (1992); Mason R.O., Measuring information output: A communication systems approach, Information & Management, 1, pp. 219-234, (1978); Delone W.H., Mclean E.R., Measuring e-Commerce Success: Applying the DeLone \& McLean Information Systems Success Model, Int.

One of the widely used assistive technologies is the tactile map that consists of Braille labeling and features annotation. The tactile map enables the visually impaired to understand the geographical information of a particular place. However, despite its wide usage, tactile map still lacks in its usability and availability especially in Malaysia. This paper aims to investigate the usability issues of tactile map, identify the requirements and proposed a conceptual prototype named TacTalk to overcome the usability issues of the existing tactile map. Interviews were conducted with the visually impaired at Saint Nicholas' Home for the Blind in Penang. The results shows lack of information, misinterpretation, complexity, and hard to remember the map as the four main usability issues. Hence the proposed solution is named TacTalk, a 'talking tactile map' which consist of a tactile map with embedded buttons that will connect to TacTalk mobile application via Bluetooth to play the audio files once the button is pressed by the user. © 2017 IEEE.","assistive technology; navigation; Tactile map; visually impaired","Navigation; Usability engineering; Vision aids; Assistive technology; Audio files; Geographical information; Malaysia; Mobile applications; Tactile maps; Visually impaired; Maps","","","","","Saint Nicholas' Home for the Blind; University of Southern Maine, USM, (304/PKOMP/6313219); Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","The authors would like to acknowledge the support from Saint Nicholas' Home for the Blind.

Therefore, this research aims to investigate the impact of success factors on the implementation of business intelligence in SMEs. A case study of Lagos State, Nigeria, is utilised for this study. A quantitative research method was used with the sample size of 165 respondents from the employees who used business intelligence in SMEs. The data obtained were analysed using the partial least squares-structural equation modelling. The findings of this study revealed that there are some key success factors such as knowledge management, technology orientation, market intelligence, and orientation and entrepreneurial orientation, which affect business intelligence implementation in SMEs. The other factors such as the organisational resources, management structure, and organisational culture were found to be insignificant success factors for the implementation of business intelligence in SMEs. This study provides an insightful understanding of the key success factors for business intelligence implementation which has an impact on business outcomes. The findings of this study will assist entrepreneurs and academicians to construct a business intelligence system that can improve overall organisational efficiency in an ever-changing economic environment. The implementation of a successful business intelligence will aid decision-making, promote economic development for businesses, foster innovation in firms, and increase company performance and productivity, all of which are part of the core sustainable development goals such as SDG 8 and SDG 9. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Business intelligence; Organisational factors; Orientation factors; Small- and medium-sized enterprises; Success factors","","","","","","School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors would like to thank School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia for the unlimited support to prepare this paper.","Abusweilem M.A., Abualoush S., The impact of knowledge management process and business intelligence on organizational performance, Management Science Letters, 9, 12, pp. 2143-2156, (2019); Adeyelure T.S., Kalema B.M., Bwalya K.J., A framework for deployment of mobile business intelligence within small and medium enterprises in developing countries, Operational Research, 18, 3, pp. 825-839, (2018); Market orientation and performance of small businesses in South Africa, Journal of Economics and Behavioral Studies (ISSN: 2220–6140), 9, 6, pp. 720-722, (2017); Al-Ansari Y., Altalib M., Sardoh M., Technology orientation, innovation and business performance: A study of Dubai SMEs, The International Technology Management Review, 3, 1, (2013); Alfoqahaa S., Critical success factors of small and medium-sized enterprises in Palestine, Journal of Research in Marketing and Entrepreneurship, 20, 2, pp. 170-188, (2018); Alvarez-Torres F.J., Lopez-Torres G.C., Schiuma G., Linking entrepreneurial orientation to SMEs’ performance: Implications for entrepreneurship universities, Management Decision, 57, 12, pp. 3364-3386, (2019); Bach M.P., Celjo A., Zoroja J., Technology acceptance model for business intelligence systems: Preliminary research, Procedia Computer Science, 100, pp. 995-1001, (2016); Bhatt G.D., Grover V., Types of information technology capabilities and their role in competitive advantage: An empirical study, Journal of Management Information Systems, 22, 2, pp. 253-277, (2005); Chen Y., Lin Z., Business Intelligence Capabilities and Firm Performance: A Study in China, International Journal of Information Management, (2020); Cohen J., A power primer, Psychological Bulletin, 112, 1, pp. 155-159, (1992); Dasgupta S., Gupta B., Espoused organizational culture values as antecedents of internet technology adoption in an emerging economy, Information and Management, 56, 6, (2019); User acceptance of new information technology-theories and models, In Annual Review of Information Science and Technology Publisher Medford, N.J.

In order to develop, adopt, and use an innovative application or system, the critical success factors are crucial. Consumer behaviours and adoption are crucial to the development of a proposed system based on the metaverse in order to improve the system's usefulness. Consequently, the goal of this study is to evaluate various theories, models, and previous research related to the innovation adoption in order to draw conclusions about the critical success factors for the adoption of the metaverse in education and consumer intention to use. © 2023, IGI Global.

Diagnosing heart disease becomes an important task to reduce its sovereignty in its early stage. Machine learning methods remain the most widely used for the classification and detection processes. This work aims to design and identify a model that best classifies cardiovascular disease and predicts the presence or absence of the disease in patients using machine learning methods with accurate predictions. Therefore, this paper compares the five most powerful machine learning platforms to classify cardiovascular disease data. The proposed five different classifiers are are support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Logistic regression (LR), Decision tree (DT), and Naive Bayes (NB) for the classification of cardiovascular disease (CVD). To validate the work, the dataset was obtained from the Kaggle repository online. The algorithms' performance is analyzed, evaluated, and compared by applying various performance factors. Results indicates that support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) methods are the most efficient for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. © 2021 IEEE.","cardiovascular disease; classification; comparative analysis; heart disease; machine learning","Barium compounds; Cardiology; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Diagnosis; Diseases; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Accurate prediction; Cardio-vascular disease; Comparative studies; Detection process; Human disorders; K-nearest neighbors; Machine learning methods; Performance factors; Learning algorithms","","","","","Division of Research & Innovation; Division of Research Innovation; University of Southern Maine, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315435)","Funding text 1: VII.

For this reason, two quantitative studies were conducted to find user behavior towards using online shopping before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Questionnaire was used as the research instrument and an online survey was conducted in which 82 respondents in Nigeria participated for both studies. Both studies develop hypotheses through the integration of technology acceptance models, unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, and theory of planned behavior. The results of the study before and during COVID-19 pandemic are compared accordingly. Based on the findings of this study, recommendations were proffered in relation to the results of the various hypothesized factors.

Mobile health-care systems (MHSs) involve the use of superior and reliable communication techniques to deliver biomedical signals over long distances. As MHSs are playing a critical role in human life, assessment is required for these kinds of systems in order to prove their success and failure. Traditional design analysis typically focuses on the system assessment from the technology point of view, whereas sociotechnical analysis looks at how the technology will incorporate into the user’s activities. Based on sociotechnical viewpoint, social and technical issues are complementary and they cannot be separated. This study aims to provide a critical review of the research in this domain and to offer our perspective on possible directions for future mobile health. The focus of this study is on sociotechnical factors that will affect mobile health-care performance. We review sociotechnical factors of different MHSs in order to recognize their effective factors. © 2015 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","","","","","","","","Akter S., D'Ambra J., Ray P., Service quality of mHealth platforms: Development and validation of a hierarchical model using PLS, Electronic Markets, 20, pp. 209-227, (2010); Akter S., D'Ambra J., Ray P., User perceived service quality of m-health services in developing countries, 18th European Conference on Information Systems, (2010); Akter S., Ray P., mHealth-An ultimate platform to serve the unserved reviews, IMIA Yearbook, pp. 94-100, (2010); Ammenwerth E., Brender J., Nykanen P., Prokosch H.-U., Rigby M., Talmon J., Visions and strategies to improve evaluation of health information systems: Reflections and lessons based on the HIS-EVAL workshop in Innsbruck, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 73, pp. 479-491, (2004); Ammenwerth E., Graber S., Herrmann G., Burkle T., Konig J., Evaluation of health information systems-Problems and challenges, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 71, pp. 125-135, (2003); Anderson J., Aydin C., Overview: Theoretical perspectives and methodologies for the evaluation of healthcare information systems, Evaluating the Organizational Impact of Healthcare Information Systems, (2005); Au-Yeung S.W.M., Response Times in Healthcare Systems, (2007); Bailey J., Pearson S., Development of a tool for measuring and analyzing computer user satisfaction, Management Science, 29, pp. 530-545, (1983); Baumgart D.C., Personal digital assistants in health care: Experienced clinicians in the palm of your hand?, The Lancet, 366, pp. 1210-1222, (2005); Berg M., Patient care information systems and health care work: A sociotechnical approach, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 55, pp. 87-101, (1999); Buyukozkan G., Cifci G., A combined fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS based strategic analysis of electronic service quality in healthcare industry, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, pp. 2341-2354, (2012); Chatterjee S., Chakraborty S., Sarker S., Sarker S., Lau F.Y., Examining the success factors for mobile work in healthcare: A deductive study, Decision Support Systems, 46, pp. 620-633, (2009); Chien T.-N., Hsieh S.-H., Cheng P.-H., Chen Y.-P., Chen S.-J., Luh J.-J., Chen H.-S., Lai J.-S., Usability evaluation of mobile medical treatment carts: Another explanation by information engineers, Journal of Medical Systems, 36, pp. 1327-1334, (2012); Conklin J.H., Gotterer M.H., Rickman J., On-line terminal response time: The effects of background activity, Information and Management, 5, pp. 169-173, (1982); Cousins K.C., Robey D., Human agency in a wireless world: Patterns of technology use in nomadic computing environments, Information and Organization, 15, pp. 151-180, (2005); Cronholm S., Goldkuhl G., Strategies for information systems evaluation-Six generic types, Electronic Journal of Information Systems Evaluation, 6, pp. 65-74, (2003); Daft R.L., Lengel R.H., Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design, Management Science, 32, pp. 554-571, (1986); Dahl Y., Alsos O., Svanaes D., Evaluating mobile usability: The role of fidelity in fullscale laboratory simulations with mobile ict for hospitals, Human-Computer Interaction.

Researchers from all over the world have shown an interest in developing deception classification methods to reduce the issue. Despite numerous obstacles that can thwart the efforts, the researchers aim to create an automated, stable, accurate, and effective mechanism for misinformation classification. In this paper, a systematic literature review is conducted to analyse the state-of-the-art related to the classification of misinformation on social media. IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Taylor & Francis, Wiley, Google Scholar are used as databases to find relevant papers since 2018–2021. Firstly, the study begins by reviewing the history of the issues surrounding Covid-19 misinformation and its effects on social media users. Secondly, various neuro-fuzzy and neural network classification methods are identified. Thirdly, the strength, limitations, and challenges of neuro-fuzzy and neural network approaches are verified for the classification misinformation specially in case of Covid-19. Finally, the most efficient hybrid method of neuro-fuzzy and neural networks in terms of performance accuracy is discovered. This study is wrapped up by suggesting a hybrid ANFIS-DNN model for improving Covid-19 misinformation classification.

At the same time, it plays a great role in several other domains due to the fact that anomaly may reveal rare but represent an important phenomenon. The objective of this paper is to detect anomalies and identify the possible variables that caused these anomalies on historical assembly data for two series of products. Multiple anomaly detection techniques were performed; HBOS, IForest, KNN, CBLOF, OCSVM, LOF, and ABOD. Moreover, we used AUROC and Rank Power as performance metrics, followed by Boosting ensemble learning method to ensure the best anomaly detectors robustness. The techniques that gave the highest performance are KNN, ABOD for both product series datasets with 0.95 and 0.99 AUROC respectively. Finally, we applied a statistical root cause analysis on the detected anomalies with the use of Pareto chart to visualize the frequency of the possible causes and its cumulative occurrence. The results showed that there are seven rejection causes for both product series, whereas the first three causes are responsible for 85% of the rejection rates. Besides, assembly machines engineers reported a significant reduction in the rejection rates in both assembly machines after tuning the specification limits of the rejection causes identified by this research results. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

DevOps eliminates the development and operations department barriers. The paper aims to develop a conceptual model for adopting DevOps practices in software development organizations by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The research also aims to determine the influencing factors of DevOps practices’ acceptance and adoption in software organizations, determine gaps in the software development literature, and introduce a clear picture of current technology acceptance and adoption research in the software industry. A comprehensive literature review clarifies how users accept and adopt new technologies and what leads to adopting DevOps practices in the software industry as the starting point for developing a conceptual framework for adopting DevOps in software organizations. The literature results have formulated the conceptual framework for adopting DevOps practices. The resulting model is expected to improve understanding of software organizations’ acceptance and adoption of DevOps practices. The research hypotheses must be tested to validate the model.

Though the existing methods offer invaluable insights, they undertake a rather different project than that of literary scholars who seek to examine privileged or unprivileged representations of certain spaces. This study aims to propose a computerized method to examine how matters of space and spatiality are addressed in literary writings. As the primary source of data, the study will focus on Viet Thanh Nguyen's The Sympathizer (2015), which explores the lives of Vietnamese diaspora in two geographical locations, Vietnam, and America. To examine the portrayed spatial relations, that is which country is privileged over the other, and to find out the underlying opinion about the two places, this study performs topic modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) by using TextBlob. In addition, Python is used as the analytical tool for this project as it supports two LDA algorithms: Gensim and Mallet. To overcome the limitation that the performance of the model relies on the available libraries in Python, the study employs machine learning approach. Even though the results indicated that both geographical spaces are portrayed slightly positively, America achieves a higher polarity score than Vietnam and hence seems to be the favored space in the novel. This study can assist literary scholars in analyzing spatial relations more accurately in large volumes of works.

The goal of this study is to scrutinize a proposed research model for predicting factors that influence student’s behavioral intention to use e-learning system at Begum Rokeya University, Bangladesh. The study used quantitative approach and developed a research model based on several technological acceptance models. In order to test the model, a survey was conducted to obtain data from 262 university students. SEM-PLS, a multivariate statistical analysis technique, was used to analyze the responses to examine the model, factors, structural relationships, and hypotheses. The result shows that ‘perceived usefulness’ and ‘perceived ease of use’ positively and significantly influenced by ‘perceived enjoyment’. Furthermore, ‘perceived usefulness’, ‘perceived ease of use’ and ‘facilitating condition’ have a significant impact to predict behavioral intention to use e-learning. The results of mediation analysis show that ‘perceived usefulness’ and ‘perceived ease of use’ have mediating effects between the predictors and the outcome. Finally, ‘facilitating condition’ have a remarkable moderating effect to predict the student’s behavioral intention in using e-learning.

The new, linked virtual world ushers in an easy and unrestricted movement of data, cash, ideas, goods, and people. It is projected that the usage of the metaverse in education would upend current learning methodologies since it will increase learning strategies, the use of technology, and the options available to students, educators, and education providers. Nevertheless, there are presently few systematic studies on how scholars used immersive virtual reality for academic purposes that noted the use of both expensive and inexpensive head-mounted displays. Therefore, this chapter aims to examine virtual reality and Eduverse from a historical and technological standpoint. The success of virtual reality in education will primarily depend on how motivated students, as the main consumers, become and their capacity to recognise the key components required to reach a suitable degree of learning through virtual reality. © 2023, IGI Global.

In this regard, Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things (1997) has garnered an astounding mix of positive and negative reactions from readers across the globe. This chapter adopts an artificial intelligence approach to analyse netizen readers' feedback on the novel as documented in the book cataloguing website Goodreads. To this end, an opinion mining framework is proposed based on artificial intelligence techniques such as topic modelling and sentiment analysis. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) are applied and compared to find the abstract ""topics"" that occur in a collection of reviews. Furthermore, lexicon-based sentiment analysis approaches such as Vader and Textblob algorithms are used and compared to find the review sentiment polarities. © 2023, IGI Global.

Thus, online B2C business models enable traditional offline stores to boost their sales. This study aims to explore the use of historical sales and behavioral data analytics to construct a recommendation model. A process model is proposed, which is the combination of recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) analysis method and the k-means clustering algorithm. RFM analysis is used to segment customer levels in the company while the association rule theory and the apriori algorithm are utilized for completing the shopping basket analysis and recommending products based on the results. The proposed recommendation model provides a good marketing mix to improve sales and market responsiveness. In addition, it recommends specific products to new customers as well as specific groups of target customers. This study offered a practical business transformation case that can assist companies in a similar situation to transform their business model and improve their profits. © 2022 IGI Global.

In order for an individual to protect their health, they are required to adopt healthy eating and practice regular exercises which also means that they have to adapt to a habit change in their daily routine. This healthy habit change does not only protect against heart diseases but also other chronic diseases such as cancer and stroke. Therefore, a habit-change support web-based system with big data analytics and decision-making features called Doctive is developed in this study to lower the risks of heart diseases. Doctive is targeted for hospital authorities to monitor patients and their habits and to prescribe medication and advice based on patients’ habits and gathered information. Furthermore, this system also provides emergency assistance for patients based on their current location. This proposed system, would also be beneficial in collecting and organizing patients’ information to ease access and speed the process of data entry and retrieval. The system was tested and evaluated by 5 people who were medically qualified or with knowledge and expertise in the field of data analytics and visualization. After gathering their opinionated responses, the results were tabulated and analyzed to be taken into consideration for improvements and to garner ideas for the future development of the system. Doctive can be useful for healthcare providers and developers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big data analytics; Decision-making; Habit-change; Medical information system; Web-based system","Advanced Analytics; Behavioral research; Big data; Cardiology; Data Analytics; Data visualization; Decision making; Diseases; Hospitals; Patient monitoring; Websites; Chronic disease; Daily routines; Health care providers; Heart disease; Hospital authorities; Medical services; Mortality rate; Web-based system; Search engines","","","","","Division of Research & Innovation; University of Southern Maine, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315435)","Acknowledgment.

This study proposes a text analytics lifecycle to detect and visualize the prevailing themes in a corpus of literary texts. Two objectives are to be pursued: First, the study seeks to apply a Topic Modeling approach with selected algorithms of LDA, LSI, NMF, and HDP that can effectively detect the recurring topics about the major themes developed in the dataset. Second, the project aims to apply a Sentiment Analysis model that can analyze the polarity of writers’ discourse on the detected thematic topics with the algorithms of Vader and TextBlob. The implementation of Topic Modeling has detected six thematic topics of sex, family, revolution, imprisonment, intellectual, and death. The adoption of the Sentiment Analysis model also revealed that the feelings attached to all the identified themes are largely negative sentiments expressed towards socio-political issues. © 2022, Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

In this paper a new parking system called Smart Parking System (SPS) is proposed to assist drivers to find vacant spaces in a car park in a shorter time. The new system uses ultrasonic (ultrasound) sensors to detect either car park occupancy or improper parking actions. Different detection technologies are reviewed and compared to determine the best technology for developing SPS. Features of SPS include vacant parking space detection, detection of improper parking, display of available parking spaces, and directional indicators toward vacant parking spaces, payment facilities and different types of parking spaces (vacant, occupied, reserved and handicapped) through the use of specific LEDs. This paper also describes the use of an SPS system from the entrance into a parking lot until the finding of a vacant parking space. The system is designed for a four-level parking lot with 100 parking spaces and five aisles on each floor. The system architecture defines the essential design features such as location of sensors, required number of sensors and LEDs for each level, and indoor and outdoor display boards.","Car park; Improper parking Directional signage; SPS; Ultrasonic sensors","","","","","","","","Fishbein M., Ajzen I., Belief, Attitude, Intention and Behaviour: An Introduction to Theory and Research, (1975); Coopers P.W.H., From Beijing to Budapest-Winning Brands.

Medical decision-making is transformed by IoT-based technologies, which provide services such as transferring medial data/biomedical signals, patient tracking and remote monitoring, secure access to medical data, and rapid emergency response. Traditional healthcare management is prone to biases and mistakes, which can have an impact on the quality of care delivered to patients. The scenario is generally caused by a clinical judgement made by doctors based on their intuition and expertise. Furthermore, the traditional human decision-making process might result in inaccurate descriptions. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the development of an IoT-based heart disease remote monitoring system called Remoteheart. The system utilizes IoT devices to measure patient biomedical data such as blood pressure, Oxygen, ECG, PPG, and Heart rate. The data is transferred to hospital information management system from time to time and analyzed using machine learning techniques. A decision tree is created and presented to healthcare professionals for better decision making about patient situation and treatment. RemoteHeart is successfully developed and evaluated by 24 users. This chapter can assist healthcare practitioners in implementing suitable IoT-based healthcare remote monitoring systems to improve medical information system decision-making. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Decision support system; Decision tree; Heart disease; Internet of Things; Machine learning; Remote monitoring system; Web-based system","","","","","","Division of Research and Innovation; RCMO, (304/PKOMP/6315435); School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia; University of Southern Maine, USM","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements The authors are thankful to School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for unlimited supports.

Previous recommender systems were hard coded and only extracted items from the same category. With this tactic, customers are limited to viewing only one category of products; items with several categories cannot be viewed. A concern for the e-commerce sector, particularly in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, is the growth of consumer preferences, the issue of cold starts, and the huge number of stocks holding units for new items. Therefore, this study aims to develop a product recommendation system for an e-commerce platform which deals with health supplements. For this reason, collaborative and content-based filtering are combined to propose a hybrid recommender system. In the proposed hybrid model, user’s actions are converted into implicit rating weightage first. Then, to tackle the problem of increasing customer preferences, collaborative filtering is used to generate user’s rating for warm-start items. Moreover, content-based filtering is used to solve cold start problem by recommending products to the users based on the similarity of the products regardless of user profile. Term frequency- inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm is adopted to weight the feature from the dataset first, then it creates step-by-step cosine similarity table. Finally, the proposed hybrid model is evaluated based on error metrices, ranking metrices, and business metrics and then compared based on the standard benchmarking algorithms. The best algorithm is selected to be used for the system development. Finally, the proposed hybrid model is developed and integrated into the real online e-commerce platform for healthcare company to handle the large number of stocks keeping units, cold start issues, and increasing customer preferences. This study can assist the healthcare companies to recommend relevant products to their customers and to help them stay competitive in healthcare e-commerce industry. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cold Start Problem; Collaborative Filtering; Content-based Filtering; e-Commerce; Health Supplement; Implicit rating; Information System; Recommender System","Collaborative filtering; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Health care; Inverse problems; Sales; Text processing; User profile; Cold start problems; Cold-start; Commerce platforms; Content based filtering; Customer preferences; E- commerces; Health supplement; Hybrid model; Hybrid recommender systems; Implicit rating; Recommender systems","","","","","Division of Research & Innovation, Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6315435); School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors are thankful to the School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia and Division of Research & Innovation, Universiti Sains Malaysia for the support from Short Term Grant (304/PKOMP/6315435).

In the literature, low health literacy and negative health attitude are the two main causal factors for high number of lifestyle disease. Meanwhile, mobile health or better known as mHealth is found to enhance health literacy and encourage positive health attitude. This study aims to find the relationship between health literacy, health attitude and lifestyle disease for residence in Malaysia. A total of 150 responses have been collected using a questionnaire posted via social media platforms. The findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between health literacy and lifestyle disease as well as health attitude and lifestyle disease. Majority of the respondents have been found to have low health literacy and negative health attitude too. A mHealth application with features of disease information, symptoms checker, calorie counter, medication information and exercise can be proposed with hope to improve health literacy and attitude of Malaysia residence. The proposed features are based on responses solicited from the questionnaire. © 2017 IEEE.","Health Attitude; Health Literacy; Lifestyle Disease; Mobile health; Penang","Health care; Information systems; Metadata; mHealth; Surveys; Health literacy; Lifestyle disease; Malaysia; Penang; Social media platforms; Health","","","","","","","News D., Lifestyle' Diseases Kill Millions Prematurely: WHO, (2015); Kariuki R.M.B., Alexander E., Lall S., White R., Parby J.I., Huang C.-Y., Wheeler S., Gracia N.L., Dasgupta B., Mukim M., Shi T., Harnessing urbanization to end poverty and boost prosperity in Africa : An action agenda for transformation, The World Bank, (2013); Zhu Y.-G., Ioannidis J.P., Li H., Jones K.C., Martin F.L., Understanding and Harnessing the Health Effects of Rapid Urbanization in China, (2011); Steyn K., Damasceno A., Lifestyle and related risk factors for chronic diseases, Disease and Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa, 2, pp. 247-265, (2006); Vaartha M., Urbanisation among Reasons for Rise in Diseases Like Cancer, (2016); Kahn J.G., Yang J.S., Kahn J.S., Mobile'health needs and opportunities in developing countries, Health Affairs, 29, pp. 252-258, (2010); Stats I., Internet Usage Statistics, the Internet Big Picture.

Ischemic heart disease is a major cause of disability and premature death in many parts of the world that can still be mitigated through lifestyle changes. While the existing mHealth solutions that encourage users to maintain healthy lifestyle habits do exist, they lack the reliable advice of healthcare professionals to monitor patient's lifestyle habits remotely. The process of manually collecting patient data for analysis and clinical testing can also be time-consuming for healthcare professionals. Therefore, this study proposed a webbased information system to monitor lifestyle habits and habit-change of people prone to heart disease. The system collects lifestyle habit data from a smartwatch and smartphone. Then, the system utilizes machine learning techniques to classify the patient's lifestyle habit data such as diet, exercise, and sleep. Furthermore, the system is used to upload echocardiograms during the echocardiography test in the hospitals and receive the echocardiography results. The data analytical results are visualized on an intelligent dashboard that can be viewed by doctors using the web application. The system is expected to support doctors in decision-making for digital care pathways in order to provide timely intervention for lifestyle modifications. © 2023 CEUR-WS.

On a recent case in China, individuals used online platforms to express their outrage at racial insults against the Chinese in Paul W. S. Anderson’s Monster Hunter (2020). This article uses sentiment analysis and natural language processing to analyze Chinese users’ views and responses on short-text social media platform called Weibo. More than 3,000 users’ reviews are collected through a web crawler tool. An unsupervised way is chosen to carry out Sentiment Analysis. Findings reveal that the overall proportion of negative reviews about the movie is not high. Positive comments are relatively normal, and most of them are comments on the movie itself. There were negative comments before the movie was released but these comments did not contain content related to “辱华”. The negative reviews after the release of the movie include different types of content: some are about the movie itself, some are because of “辱华”, and some mention “腾讯”. This study can benefit large-scale decision-makers on matters related censorship and filtering. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Monster Hunter; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Social Media","Decision making; Motion pictures; Social networking (online); Web crawler; Andersons; Language processing; Monster hunter; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Online platforms; Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Social media platforms; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Ying S.Y., Keikhosrokiani P., Asl M.P., Saeed F., Mohammed F., Al-Nahari A., Comparison of data analytic techniques for a spatial opinion mining in literary works: A review paper, Innovative Systems for Intelligent Health Informatics, 72, pp. 523-535, (2021); Malik E.F., Keikhosrokiani P., Asl M.P., Text mining life cycle for a spatial reading of Viet Thanh Nguyen’s The Refugees (2017), 2021 International Congress of Advanced Technology and Engineering (ICOTEN), (2021); Ghosh S., Gunning D., Natural Language Processing Fundamentals: Build Intelligent Applications that Can Interpret the Human Language to Deliver Impactful Results, (2019); Nadkarni P.M., Ohno-Machado L., Chapman W.W., Natural language processing: An introduction, J.

A survey was conducted in the form of questionnaire to Smartphone users in Penang, Malaysia for the duration of three weeks starting in September 2013. A total number of 123 valid surveys out of 150 were returned, which is equivalent to a response rate of 82%. The authors use Partial Least Squares (PLS) for analyzing the proposed measurement model. The factors that are tested are self-efficacy, anxiety, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, attitude, and behavioral intention to use. The results indicate which factors have a significant effect on Smartphone users' behavioral intention and which factors are not significant. The results assist in assessing whether MHS is highly demanded by users or not, and will assist in development of the system in the future. © 2015 by IGI Global.

This research studies how technology impacts the health care system to tackle the problem of forming an efficient team for medical purposes at hospitals in the Northern region of Malaysia. In this paper, we explore the Knowledge-based Collaborative Surgical Team (K-CST) system further, which automatically assigns an efficient collaborative surgical team. By utilizing the evolution of technologies and the Internet, this study aims to incorporate a knowledge-based approach with a genetic algorithm to form an efficient medical team. A survey was conducted among 30 health practitioners in the Northern region of Malaysia to predict the acceptance to use of the proposed K-CST system in comparison with the existing system. Collected data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) by using Pearson Correlation to describe the strength of the relationship between K-CST system and the existing system. Results for K- CST system was significant and have a positive relationship, while the results for the existing system were slightly insignificant and had a negative relationship. This study recommends that there should be some improvement in the system with the purpose of promoting a better healthcare system. The results from the analysis showed the hat K-CST system is accepted in the Northern region of Malaysia and has a good potential to be implemented in hospitals in the country. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Collaborative Team; Genetic Algorithm; Knowledge-based system; Technology Acceptance Model","Correlation methods; Genetic algorithms; Hospitals; Surgery; Collaborative teams; Existing systems; Healthcare systems; Knowledge based; Knowledge-based systems; Malaysia; Northern regions; Research studies; Technology acceptance model; Technology impact; Knowledge based systems","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/ICT02/USM/02/4)","Acknowledgement to “Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with Project Code: FRGS/1/2020/ICT02/USM/02/4.

Many of the people with diabetes are affected with type 2 or onset diabetes. Early identification and treatment is crucial to address this health issue. However, in most of the cases, the identification process is extremely sluggish, which impedes treatment. Therefore, this chapter aims to design a model which predicts the onset of diabetes from medical records with maximum level of accuracy in the shortest possible time. In this experiment, eight classification algorithms—REPTree, J48, Naive Bayes, Logistic, Sequential Minimal Optimization, ZeroR, PART, and IBk—were executed on Pima Indians Diabetes Database for building a binary class prediction model. The performances of the algorithms are evaluated based on confusion matrix, f-score, precision, recall, and accuracy level. The results indicate the logistic regression model achieved the highest performance with accuracy of 77.47%. This study can assist healthcare professionals to predict the onset of diabetes from medical records and to prevent further improvement of the disease. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

A lot of studies are devoted to feature extraction. Recent researches propose to extract features by pre-trained neural networks, and the output is used for feature matching. However, the quality and the quantity of the features extracted by these methods are difficult to meet the requirements for the practical applications. In this article, we propose a two-stage object-aware-based feature matching method. Specifically, the proposed object-aware block predicts a weighted feature map through a mask predictor and a prefeature extractor, so that the subsequent feature extractor pays more attention to the key regions by using the weighted feature map. In addition, we introduce a state-of-the-art model estimation algorithm to align image pair as the input of the object-aware block. Furthermore, our method also employs an advanced outlier removal algorithm to further improve matching quality. Experimental results show that our object-aware-based feature matching method improves the performance of feature matching compared with several state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","feature matching; image alignment; model estimation; object-aware; outlier removal","Extraction; Statistics; Feature map; Feature matching methods; Features extraction; Features matching; Image alignment; Model estimation; Object-aware; Outlier removals; Recent researches; Weighted features; Feature extraction","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61972187, 62172197)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62172197 and 61972187.

They perform burn-in tests on each unit of product before shipment to ensure a high standard of quality. Burn-in is normally associated with high production costs and slows down manufacturing operations. This study aims to enhance the manufacturing process by predicting test failure patterns using machine learning methods. By identifying the components that are likely to cause failures, manufacturers can accelerate the rectification process and improve delivery time which in turn leads to better customer service. This study hypothesized that the component of concern produces a higher test failure rate. To provide insight into the data and test the hypothesis, descriptive and predictive analytics are used at various stages. Predictive analytics was performed using machine learning via Naïve Bayes since it outperformed SVM and Random Forest classifier. For the descriptive analysis stage, a visual representation revealed many components (81) to be associated with a more than average test failure rate. Fisher’s exact test confirmed that 12 of them are statistically significant and worth studying their behaviour further. Moreover, an association rule mining exercise identified several combinations of modules that have a higher inclination with the test failure. For the predictive analytics stage, the Naïve Bayes classifier predicted test failure with 79% accuracy and 53% recall rate. Another Naïve Bayes classifier predicted error messages associated with a test failure with 68% recall rate over manually labelled error messages. However, a neural network-based automatic text classifier was developed and tested that yielded 66% accuracy. This analysis provides the foundation for a recommendation made that can reduce the burn test failure rate by 25% which is expected to increase further with the improved performance model upon training with a larger data set. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Burn-in tests; Descriptive analytics; Manufacturing process; Predictive analytics","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Failure (mechanical); Failure rate; Machine learning; Statistical tests; Burn-in test; Component failures; Computer components; Descriptive analytic; Error messages; Failure rate; Manufacturing process; Naive Bayes classifiers; Recall rate; Test failure; Predictive analytics","","","","","Prototype Grant Scheme, (203/PKOMP/6740069); Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Institute of Postgraduate Studies, Universiti Sains Malaysia, IPS, (1011/PKOMP/8014076); Kementerian Pendidikan; Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors would like to thank the Research University Grant (1011/PKOMP/8014076) by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) and the Prototype Grant Scheme (203/PKOMP/6740069) by Ministry of Education Malaysia for supporting this work.

The study employs text analytics techniques, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) to extract and analyze data from six novels written by Afghan and Pakistani diasporic writers. The aim is to identify and classify the topics and sentiments related to depression in the selected narratives. To achieve these objectives, four algorithms for topic modelling are utilized, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Index (LSI), Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Additionally, a rule-based technique is applied for sentiment analysis using two Python libraries, VADER and TextBlob. For the classification of depression, four machine learning models are employed: Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results indicate that HDP has the highest score in topic modelling with a score of 0.79. Furthermore, Vader provides more insightful sentiment analysis results. With a classification model accuracy of 68%, Naïve Bayes outperforms the other machine learning models. The findings suggest that the proposed model can efficiently predict all classes of depression, particularly when the dataset is balanced. © 2023 The Author(s)","Depression; Diasporic novels; Machine learning;

The general public has responded to call of the government to stay at home. Offline retail stores have been severely affected. Therefore, in order to transform a traditional offline sales model to the B2C model and to improve the shopping experience, this study aims to utilize historical sales data for exploring, building sales prediction and recommendation models. A novel data science life-cycle and process model with Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis method with the combination of various analytics algorithms are utilized in this study for sales prediction and product recommendation through user behavior analytics. RFM analysis method is utilized for segmenting customer levels in the company to identify the importance of each level. For the purchase prediction model, XGBoost and Random Forest machine learning algorithms are used to build prediction models and 5-fold Cross-Validation method is utilized to evaluate their. For the product recommendation model, the association rules theory and Apriori algorithm are used to complete basket analysis and recommend products according to the outcomes. Moreover, some suggestions are proposed for the marketing department according to the outcomes. Overall, the XGBoost model achieved better performance and better accuracy with F1-score around 0.789. The proposed recommendation model provides good recommendation results and sales combinations for improving sales and market responsiveness. Furthermore, it recommend specific products to new customers. This study offered a very practical and useful business transformation case that assists companies in similar situations to transform their business models. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

A survey was conducted in the form of questionnaire to Smartphone users in Penang, Malaysia for the duration of three weeks starting in September 2013. A total number of 123 valid surveys out of 150 were returned, which is equivalent to a response rate of 82%. The authors use Partial Least Squares (PLS) for analyzing the proposed measurement model. The factors that are tested are self-efficacy, anxiety, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, attitude, and behavioral intention to use. The results indicate which factors have a significant effect on Smartphone users’ behavioral intention and which factors are not significant. The results assist in assessing whether MHS is highly demanded by users or not, and will assist in development of the system in the future. © 2019 by IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Ajzen I., From Intentions to Actions: A Theory of Planned Behavior, Action Control, pp. 11-39, (1985);

These perceptions can impact the acceptance or rejection of the information. To address this issue, the study has employed deep learning and machine learning models to automatically identify consumer perceptions of health information. Furthermore, the study used a survey to collect data from 253 individuals to train the models, measuring the perception of 18 dimensions related to health information quality. This will help health information providers to provide personalized health information that aligns with individual preferences. The RandomForest and neural network model are found to have achieved the best performance among all the algorithms with an Accuracy of over 90% in all the quality dimensions. In sum, our findings show that automating the identification of consumer perception is feasible, which is an essential step toward providing online health information that matches consumer perception and increases the willingness to use it.  © 2023 IEEE.","health information quality; health information seeking; information quality; online health information","E-learning; Information analysis; Learning systems; Neural network models; Consumer perception; Health information quality; Health information seeking; Health informations; Information quality; Information seeking; Online health information; Quality perceptions; Deep learning","","","","","","","Afful-Dadzie E., Afful-Dadzie A., Online health consumer behaviour: What informs user decisions on information quality?, Computers in Human Behavior Reports, 3, (2021); Mead N., Varnam R., Rogers A., Roland M., What predicts patients' interest in the internet as a health resource in primary care in england?, Journal of Health Services Research & Policy, 8, 1, pp. 33-39, (2003); Sun Y., Zhang Y., Gwizdka J., Trace C.B., Consumer evaluation of the quality of online health information: Systematic literature review of relevant criteria and indicators, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 21, 5, (2019); Kinkead L., Allam A., Krauthammer M., Autodiscern: Rating the quality of online health information with hierarchical encoder attentionbased neural networks, BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, 20, 1, pp. 1-13, (2020); Alasmari A., Alhothali A., Allinjawi A., Hybrid machine learning approach for arabic medical web page credibility assessment, Health Informatics Journal, 28, 1, (2022); Upadhyay R., Pasi G., Viviani M., Vec4cred: A model for health misinformation detection in web pages, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 82, 4, pp. 5271-5290, (2022); Di Sotto S., Viviani M., Health misinformation detection in the social web: An overview and a data science approach, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 19, 4, (2022); Upadhyay R., Pasi G., Viviani M., Health misinformation detection in web content: A structural-, content-based, and context-aware approach based on web2vec, Proceedings of the Conference on Information Technology for Social Good, pp. 19-24, (2021); Boyer C., Selby M., Scherrer J.-R., Appel R., The health on the net code of conduct for medical and health websites, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 28, 5, pp. 603-610, (1998); Silberg W.M., Lundberg G.D., Musacchio R.A., Assessing controlling and assuring the quality of medical information on the internet: Caveant lector et viewor-let the reader and viewer beware, Jama, 277, 15, pp. 1244-1245, (1997); Tao D., Lerouge C., Smith K.J., De Leo G., Et al., Defining information quality into health websites: A conceptual framework of health website information quality for educated young adults, JMIR Human Factors, 4, 4, (2017); Al-Jefri M., Evans R., Uchyigit G., Ghezzi P., What is health information quality?

This study aims to perform text mining techniques—opinion mining using topic modeling—to examine the range of topics that are explored within reader reviews in social media. In pursuit of this goal, the study focuses on 844 Goodreads reviews of the Iranian diasporic writer Firoozeh Dumas’s Funny in Farsi to analyze the variety of topics that are covered in readers’ responses. As topic modelling techniques, LDA and LSA are utilized to detect, compare and evaluate the major topics within the dataset. The optimum number of topics for both LDA and LSI is 3 with a coherence score of 0.50451438 and 0.4573542, respectively. Based on the overall performance, LDA is considered the best topic modelling method for this study. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Funny in Farsi; Goodreads; Opinion mining; Social media analytics; Topic modelling","Data mining; Social networking (online); Case-studies; Funny in farsi; Goodread; Literary works; Opinion mining; Rapid growth; Social media analytics; Social media platforms; Social networking services; Topic Modeling; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Ghose A., Ipeirotis P.G., Estimating the helpfulness and economic impact of product reviews: Mining text and reviewer characteristics, IEEE Trans.
