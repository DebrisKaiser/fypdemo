However, nearly 90% of the causes of recurrent stroke are modifiable, which means recurrent strokes can be averted by controlling risk factors, which are mainly behavioral and metabolic in nature. Thus, it shows that from the previous works that recurrent stroke prediction model could help in minimizing the possibility of getting recurrent stroke. Previous works have shown promising results in predicting first-time stroke cases with machine learning approaches. However, there are limited works on recurrent stroke prediction using machine learning methods. Hence, this work is proposed to perform an empirical analysis and to investigate machine learning algorithms implementation in the recurrent stroke prediction models. This research aims to investigate and compare the performance of machine learning algorithms using recurrent stroke clinical public datasets. In this study, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Bayesian Rule List (BRL) are used and compared their performance in the domain of recurrent stroke prediction model. The result of the empirical experiments shows that ANN scores the highest accuracy at 80.00%, follows by BRL with 75.91% and SVM with 60.45%. © 2021 University of Baghdad.

In recent years, the growth of digital libraries and video databases makes it more challenging and important to extract useful information from raw data to prevent and detect the crimes from the database automatically. Street crime snatching and theft detection is the major challenge in video mining. The main target is to select features/objects which usually occurs at the time of snatching. The number of moving targets imitates the performance, speed and amount of motion in the anomalous video. The dataset used in this paper is Snatch 101; the videos in the dataset are further divided into frames. The frames are labelled and segmented for training. We applied the VGG19 Convolutional Neural Network architecture algorithm and extracted the features of objects and compared them with original video features and objects. The main contribution of our research is to create frames from the videos and then label the objects. The objects are selected from frames where we can detect anomalous activities. The proposed system is never used before for crime prediction, and it is computationally efficient and effective as compared to state-of-the-art systems. The proposed system outperformed with 81 % accuracy as compared to stateof-the-art systems. © Science and Information Organization.","AlexNet; Anomalous detection; ConvoNet; Surveillance video; VGG16; VGG19","Convolution; Digital libraries; Network architecture; Network security; Neural networks; Security systems; Alexnet; Anomalous detections; Convolutional neural network; Convonet; State-of-the-art system; Surveillance video; Useful patterns; VGG16; VGG19; Video surveillance; Crime","","","","","","","Manjunath T., Hegadi R.S., Ravikumar G., A survey on multimedia data mining and its relevance today, IJCSNS, 10, 11, pp. 165-170, (2010); Mabrouk A.B., Zagrouba E., Abnormal behavior recognition for intelligent video surveillance systems: A review, Expert Systems with Applications, 91, pp. 480-491, (2018); Chen X., Zhang C., An interactive semantic video mining and retrieval platform-application in transportation surveillance video for incident detection, Data Mining, 2006.

The features classification on machine learning can be used to adopt the clustering method to define further analysis on the targeted issues. Nowadays, the epidemic disease outbreaks have caused a great concern towards Malaysian community as the diseases can cause great fatality. One of the common killer epidemic diseases in Malaysia is dengue fever. Dengue fever is caused by dengue virus that spreads by Aedes mosquitoes. The outbreaks cause several cases of death and it varies throughout the states in Malaysia. The factors that cause this epidemic disease were determined and the data on the dengue outbreaks in Malaysia were gathered. To predict the infected area of dengue, data were mined and the machine learning method was implemented. In this study, the clustering method in machine learning for predictive analysis is proven to be an effective method in determining the most infected area of dengue outbreaks in Malaysia: Selangor and W.P. Kuala Lumpur/ Putrajaya. The selected areas were identified as the busiest place in Malaysia with a great number of population that had caused high physical contact and promoted the dengue outbreaks.","Clustering; Dengue outbreaks; Epidemic disease; Machine learning; Predictive analysis","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6313169)","Research reported here is pursued under the Short Term Grant Scheme by Universiti Sains Malaysia for “Pedestrian Simulator and Heuristic Search Methods for Spatial Layout Design” [304/PKOMP/6313169] and supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) by Ministry of Education Malaysia for “Spatial Layout Design Optimization with Pedestrian Simulation in a Panic Situation using Genetic Algorithm” [203.PKOMP.6711534].","Boivin G., Et al., Predicting influenza infections during epidemics with use of a clinical case definition, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 31, 5, pp. 1166-1169, (2000); Ravi D., Et al., Deep learning for health informatics, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 21, 1, pp. 4-21, (2017); Shope R., Global climate change and infectious diseases, Environmental Health Perspectives, 96, pp. 171-174, (1991); Shuman E.K., Global Climate Change and Infectious Diseases, New England Journal of Medicine, 362, 12, pp. 1061-1063, (2010); Sadilek A., Kautz H., Silenzio V., Predicting disease transmission from geo-tagged micro-blog data, Proceedings of the Twenty-sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 136-142, (2012); Andrick B., Et al., Infectious disease and climate change: detecting contributing factors and predicting future outbreaks.

The existing emergency routes are designed based on the shortest path to the nearest egress in a vacant layout. This research aims to design an emergency route plan in a realistic closed layout with interior arrangements and crowds as static and dynamic impediments that cause movement divergence and misdirection that affect evacuation time. This research proposes an automated emergency route design using Cellular Automata (CA) based pedestrian simulation in a realistic layout. The simulation was integrated with the Pythagorean Theorem (PT) and Dijkstra's Algorithm (DA) to imitate human exit-finding behaviour during evacuation. The results showed that PT is viable in layouts with static obstacles, requiring 20 % less travel distances and evacuation time than DA with similar experiment sets. However, the DA approach results have become on par with the PT in a layout with dynamic and static obstacles. DA outperforms PT in densely populated regions, while PT outperforms DA in less populated regions. © 2022, DAAAM International Vienna.

One effort to develop an early warning system is to use a forest fire hazard index as a potential assessment guide. The main factor which is a parameter in the fire hazard index calculation method is the meteorological parameter. In general, to know today's fire hazard index is calculated from today's weather conditions, but the need for an early warning system is to know the future fire hazard index. Based on a series of meteorological conditions data held for thirty-six months, using the backpropagation algorithm, it is estimated that the meteorological conditions will be several months to come. Several meteorological parameters have their respective roles, the unknown contribution of which is calculated. In this study, each parameter will be measured by predicting time series data and compared with the results of calculations. The method of calculating the forest fire index used is the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index with the meteorological parameter elements are temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and drought factor. Each parameter was trained in artificial neural networks and tested its predictions to produce accuracy for data series temperatures of 91.67%, the relative humidity of 83.33%, and wind speed of 50%.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Backpropagation; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Forecasting; Neural networks; Time series; Wind; Data series; Early Warning System; Forest fires; Hazard indices; Mcarthur forest fire danger indices; Meteorological condition; Meteorological parameters; Time-series data; Fires","","","","","","","Field R.

Nowadays, the efficiency of the evacuation process had become one of the issues during emergency incidents due to the difficulties faced by the pedestrians to access the exit points and the formation of clogging region near to the exit points and narrow pathways. Hence, the simulation of the pedestrian evacuation had been introduced as the potential solution exploration by imitating the emergency situations for predicting the survival rate and the casualties of the pedestrians involved. The pedestrian movement in the simulation will construct the movement patterns that are able to assist the development of the emergency route plan for guiding the pedestrians to find the nearest exit to escape. However, the route plan designed based on the ordinary pedestrian movement simulation will highlight the nearest exit instead of the optimal safest exit for the pedestrian to evacuate safely. Hence, to design a low-risk exit selection, this research had made a survey on three existing algorithms to optimize the exit selection process; multi-agent based algorithm, least effort algorithm and game theory algorithm. The experiments were conducted with three different structural layouts (number of doors) with variety number of dataset (number of pedestrians). The result of this research had shown that the game theory algorithm was able to assist the pedestrian movement towards the optimal nearest and safest exit for evacuation process and capable to enhance the simulation for designing a feasible emergency route plan to reduce casualties. ©BEIESP.","Evacuation route plan; Exit selection; Optimization; Pedestrian movement","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (PKOMP.8014073)","Research experiments reported were pursued under the Bridging Grant by Universiti Sains Malaysia [304.PKOMP.6316019], Research University Grant by Universiti Sains Malaysia [1001.PKOMP.8014073] and Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) by Ministry of Education Malaysia [203.PKOMP.6711534] and [203.PKOMP.6711713].","Muhamading M., About 6,000 premises destroyed by fire annually in Malaysia, News Straits Times, (2016); Stevens E., Doshi V., Stampede at Indian train station kills at least 22, Washington, D.C, (2017); Jay B.N., Tahfiz did not have fire exit; bodies found piled on top of each other, New Straits Times, Ed.

The pedestrian movement usually will be in the self-organizing state that involves the microscopic movement based on the basic Cellular Automata (CA) model. However, during the simulation of pedestrian movement, there are several features that should be highlighted that will affect the movement speed and time. Hence, this preliminary research paper introduced the horizontal transition of microscopic movement with some features that create the closeness to the human behavior for the pedestrian simulation. This preliminary research introduced a simple case study on the closed area floor design and implemented some of the features discussed. The result showed that the behavior of the pedestrian is affected by their environment situation and the movement time of the pedestrian is determined by the number of obstacles in the grid cells of the spatial layout for collision avoidance.","Behavioral; Cellular Automata Model; Layout Design; Normal Situation; Panic Situation; Pedestrian Movement","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6313169)","Research experiment reported here is pursued under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) by Ministry of Education Malaysia for “Spatial Layout Design Optimization with Pedestrian Simulation in a Panic Situation using Genetic Algorithm” [203.PKOMP.6711534] and the preliminary study of this research is supported under the Short Term Grant Scheme by Universiti Sains Malaysia for “Pedestrian Simulator and Heuristic Search Methods for Spatial Layout Design” [304/PKOMP/6313169].","Zong X., Jiang Y., Pedestrian-vehicle mixed evacuation model based on multi-particle swarm optimization, 2016 11th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE), (2016); Konstantara K., Et al., Parallel implementation of a cellular automata-based model for simulating assisted evacuation of elderly people, 2016 24th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed, and Network-based Processing (PDP), (2016); Ruiz S., Hernandez B., A parallel solver for markov decision process in crowd simulations, 2015 Fourteenth Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (MICAI), (2015); Wang H., Et al., Simulation research based on evacuation ability estimation method, 2016 12th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (WCICA), (2016); Hassan F.H., Using microscopic pedestrian simulation statistics to find clogging regions, 2016 SAI Computing Conference (SAI), (2016); Miao Q., Lv Y., Zhu F., A cellular automata based evacuation model on GPU platform, 2012 15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, (2012); Huixian J., Shaoping Z., Navigation system design of fire disaster evacuation path in buildings based on mobile terminals, 2016 11th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE), (2016); Sime J.D., Crowd psychology and engineering, Safety Science, 21, 1, pp. 1-14, (1995); Kihlstrom J.F., The person-situation interaction, The Oxford Handbook of Social Cognition, pp. 786-805, (2013); Yue H., Et al., Simulation of pedestrian flow on square lattice based on cellular automata model, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 384, 2, pp. 567-588, (2007); Lu X., Et al., Impacts of anxiety in building fire and smoke evacuation: Modeling and validation, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2, 1, pp. 255-260, (2017); Was J., Cellular automata model of pedestrian dynamics for normal and evacuation conditions, 5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA'05), (2005); Tcheukam A., Djehiche B., Tembine H., Evacuation of multilevel building: Design, control and strategic flow, 2016 35th Chinese Control Conference (CCC), (2016); Helbing D., Farkas I., Vicsek T., Simulating dynamical features of escape panic, Nature, 407, 6803, pp. 487-490, (2000)","","","Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka","","","","","","21801843","","","","English","J.

The proposed approach outperformed as compared to state-of-the-art Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) with low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) (0.3738, 0.3891, 0.3433, 0.3964), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)(13.146, 13.669, 13.104, 13.77), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (9.837, 10.896, 10.598, 10.721). Therefore, the proposed technique can help law enforcement agencies to prevent and control crime by forecasting crime patterns. Copyright: © 2022 Butt et al.

These subproblems are assigned with evenly spaced weight vectors, and they are collaboratively solved using the concept of information sharing within their own neighborhood. One of the recent algorithms, i.e., constant-distance-based neighbors for MOEA/D with dynamic weight vector adjustment (MOEA/D-AWACD), integrates the concept of constant-distance neighborhood and dynamic weight vector design. This combination creates a flexible neighborhood that can adapt to the weight vectors changes. However, MOEA/D-AWACD’s performance is dependent on a constant-distance parameter δ that adjusts the neighborhood size. To obtain an appropriate value of parameter δ , multiple and separate algorithm executions are required. Thus, in this paper, δ MOEA/D-AWACD is proposed. It employs a step-function parameter control mechanism to systematically control the parameter δ within a single algorithm execution. In a comparison study which uses ZDT, UF, and DTLZ test problems as the testbed, the proposed δ MOEA/D-AWACD is able to significantly outperform MOEA/D, MOEA/D-AWA, MOEA/D-AWACD, and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) in both hypervolume (HV) and inverted generational distance (IGD) metrics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Continuous optimization; Nature-inspired algorithm; Parameter setting; Resource allocation; Scalarization","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (1001/PKOMP/814274)","This work was supported by the Research University Grant (Grant No: 1001/PKOMP/814274) at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).

For example, the flow of a large number of people should be smooth in a well designed public space such as a stadium or hospital. In extreme cases, people might crush to death during emergency evacuations in poorly designed spaces. It is vital that design takes into account the smooth flow of pedestrians. In this paper we describe an initial exploration in using models of pedestrian flow combined with heuristic search to assist in the automatic design for spatial layout. A two-way pedestrian flow system is simulated and heuristic search techniques (genetic algorithm, simulated annealing and hill climbing) are used to find feasible spatial layouts based upon the generated statistics with promising results.","Cellular automata; Genetic algorithm; Hill-climbing; Pedestrian simulation; Simulated annealing; Spatial layout","Cellular automata; Design; Genetic algorithms; Modular robots; Pattern recognition systems; Automatic design; Emergency evacuation; Extreme case; Heuristic search; Heuristic search technique; Hill climbing; Initial exploration; Pedestrian flow; Pedestrian simulation; Public space; Spatial layout; Simulated annealing","","","","","","","Batty M., Desyllas J., Duxbury E., The discrete dynamics of small-scale spatial events: Agent-based models of mobility in carnivals and street parades, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 17, 7, pp. 673-697, (2003); Charman P., Cermics I., Antipolis S., A constraint-based approach for the generation of floor plans, Tools with Artificial Intelligence, 1994.

By applying intelligent data analysis techniques, many interesting patterns are identified for the early and onset detection and prevention of several fatal diseases. Diabetes mellitus is an extremely life-threatening disease because it contributes to other lethal diseases, i.e., heart, kidney, and nerve damage. In this paper, a machine learning based approach has been proposed for the classification, early-stage identification, and prediction of diabetes. Furthermore, it also presents an IoT-based hypothetical diabetes monitoring system for a healthy and affected person to monitor his blood glucose (BG) level. For diabetes classification, three different classifiers have been employed, i.e., random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and logistic regression (LR). For predictive analysis, we have employed long short-term memory (LSTM), moving averages (MA), and linear regression (LR). For experimental evaluation, a benchmark PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset is used. During the analysis, it is observed that MLP outperforms other classifiers with 86.08% of accuracy and LSTM improves the significant prediction with 87.26% accuracy of diabetes. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed approach is also performed with existing state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating the adaptability of the proposed approach in many public healthcare applications.  © 2021 Umair Muneer Butt et al.","","Delivery of Health Care;

However, a substantial increase in the urban population from the last few years poses challenges related to resource management, safety, and security. To ensure the safety and security in the smart city environment, this paper presents a novel approach by empowering the authorities to better visualize the threats, by identifying and predicting the highly-reported crime zones in the smart city. To this end, it first investigates the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to detect the hot-spots that have a higher risk of crime occurrence. Second, for crime prediction, Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) is exploited in each dense crime region to predict the number of crime incidents in the future with spatial and temporal information. The proposed HDBSCAN and SARIMA based crime prediction model is evaluated on ten years of crime data (2008-2017) for New York City (NYC). The accuracy of the model is measured by considering different time scenarios such as the year-wise, (i.e., for each year), and for the total considered duration of ten years using an 80:20 ratio. The 80% of data was used for training and 20% for testing. The proposed approach outperforms with an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 11.47 as compared to the highest scoring DBSCAN based method with MAE 27.03.  © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; Citizen security; crime prediction; safe city; smart cities","Artificial intelligence; Crime; Forecasting; Hierarchical clustering; Safety engineering; Smart city; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise; Mean absolute error; Prediction model; Resource management; Safety and securities; Temporal information; Urban population; Predictive analytics","","","","","Fadratul Hafinaz Hassan; School of Computer Sciences USM; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (FRGS/1/2020/TK03/USM/02/1)","Corresponding authors: Umair Muneer Butt (umair@student.usm.my), Sukumar Letchmunan (sukumar@usm.my), and Fadratul Hafinaz Hassan (fadratul@usm.my) This work was supported in part by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) through Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Grant FRGS/1/2020/TK03/USM/02/1, and in part by the School of Computer Sciences USM.","Spencer N., Butler D., Cities: The century of the city, Nature, 467, 7318, pp. 900-901, (2010); Cicirelli F., Guerrieri A., Spezzano G., Vinci A., An edge-based platform for dynamic smart city applications, Future Gener.

Continuous surveillance without the focus on a particular time becomes ineffective and inefficient because of preventive measures carried out without the knowledge of potential fire risk. Based on the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI), formulation of Drought Factor is used just for calculating the drought today based on current weather conditions, and yesterday's drought index. However, to find out the factors of drought a day after, the data is needed about the weather. Therefore, we need an algorithm that can predict the dryness factor. So, the most significant fire potential can be predicted during the dry season. Moreover, daily prediction of the dry season is needed each day to conduct the best action then a qualified preventive measure can be carried out. The method used in this study is the backpropagation algorithm which has functions for calculating, testing and training the drought factors. By using empirical data, some data are trained and then tested until it can be concluded that 100% of the data already well recognized. Furthermore, some other data tested without training, then the result is 60% of the data match. In general, this algorithm shows promising results and can be applied more to complete several variables supporters. © 2019 University of Baghdad.

This paper studies the application of Genetic Algorithm in solving problems regarding spatial layout design.

During panic situation, the survival rate of the pedestrians are depends on the several parameter values that are hard to discover due to the catastrophic case scenarios and almost impossible for the scene to be created due to the human ethical conduct. Hence, with the advance of computation technique and the improvement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) process automation, the panic situations are able to be visualized with the computer simulation. However, based on the previous simulation researches, there are a lot of features that had been found that are able to influence the pedestrian movement and caused the clogging region on the spatial layout. Hence, this research has been conducted to justify and analyze the findings of influential features by simulating the near-realistic pedestrian movement using Cellular Automata (CA) approach to re-enact the real behavioral actions of the pedestrians during panic situation. Based on the near-realistic simulation and the construction of the spatial layout design based on the features that promotes the clogging region experiments, the results had shown that the structural arrangement of a space is the proper solution to increase the pedestrian survival rate and decrease the clogging region. However, the existing structural also can enhance the safety quality of the space by rearranging the obstacles in the spatial layout. This research had introduced the granularity based approach and proves that the implementation of the fine-grain obstacles' arrangement while accommodating the interior design standard may reduce the time (10 seconds, 0.1%) taken for evacuation process and increase the probability of movement directions for the pedestrians to ensure the balance usage of the egress points. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Physics;

We further investigated pedestrian clogging regions using cell attractiveness statistics from our heat map agent. The aim of the experiment is to use the heat map agent to compute and to identify the clogging area in the layout generated. Results from the experiment have shown promising solutions in identifying a 'bad' region using heat map agents. It is found that viable layouts with higher fitness values produced improved layouts with less blockage effect. Also, the blockages appear to be near exits, T-shape junctions, wider lanes without obstacles and at the biggest density of the grid layouts. © 2016 IEEE.","cellular automata; clogging; genetic algorithm; heat map; hill climbing; pedestrian simulation; simulated annealing; spatial layout","Cellular automata; Genetic algorithms; Mathematical operators; clogging; Heat maps; Hill climbing; Pedestrian simulation; Spatial layout; Simulated annealing","","","","","","","Hassan F.H., Tucker A., Using cellular automata pedestrian flow statistics with heuristic search to automatically design spatial layout, Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI), 2010 22nd IEEE International Conference on IEEE, (2010); Hassan F.H., Tucker A., Using uniform crossover to refine simulated annealing solutions for automatic design of spatial layouts, International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence (IJCCI), (2010); Yue H., Hao H., Chen X., Shao C., Simulation of pedestrian flow on square lattice based on cellular automata model, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 384, 2, pp. 567-588, (2007); Michalewicz Z., Fogel D.B., How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics, (2000)","F.H.

The social groups thus formed, in variable proportions depending on the context, are not randomly organised but exhibit distinct features, such as the well-known tendency of 3-member groups to be arranged in a V-shape. The existence of group structures might thus impact the collective dynamics of the crowd, possibly in a critical way when emergency situations are considered. After turning a blind eye to these group aspects for years, endeavours to model groups in crowd simulation software have thrived in the past decades. This fairly short review opens on a description of their empirical characteristics and their (more controversial) impact on the global flow. Then, it aims to offer a pedagogical discussion of the main strategies to model such groups, within different types of models, in order to provide guidance for prospective modellers. © 2021 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.","crowds;

The users prefer to personalize their own space by customizing, modifying and planning based on their personal specification or preferences. However, these application tools usually highlighted the personal preferences without taking account on the universal design criteria that will cause some issues on the space utilization and security. Hence, this research paper had proposed the composition of objective functions for the user's customization and the universal design criteria with the incorporation of Genetic Algorithm (GA) operators to optimize the floor plan design.

The aim of the experiment is to compare how fast and effective the algorithms can generate automatic solutions to the layout. Experiments from our preliminary study have shown that promising results for simulated annealing and genetic algorithm operator algorithms in pedestrian simulation modelling.

The unfamiliarity of the pedestrian and the unstructured arrangement of the space area (e.g. furniture, exit point, rooms, workspace and etc.) had caused the high physical collision that can cause casualties and heavy injuries. Hence, this research is to simulate the pedestrian movement to find the impact of building’s familiarity and space design towards the pedestrian movement speed. The familiarity of the pedestrian had been tested with the horizontal movement of Von Neumann approach and optimal criterion of Moore Neighborhood approach for a closed building area with the randomization of spatial layout obstacles arrangement. The optimal Moore Neighborhood is able to re-enact the real behavior of the pedestrian with high familiarization. Hence, this research had proven that the pedestrian with high familiarity of a building escape route had moved faster with higher speed. The pedestrian movement speed was improved with the feasible spatial layout design of the closed area building that is able to shape the flow of the pedestrian’s movement and reduce the physical collision. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Cellular automata; Closed area building; Moore neighborhood; Pedestrian movement; Spatial layout design; Von neumann","Architectural design; Cellular automata; Intelligent computing; Building areas; Dangerous structures; Escape route; Horizontal movements; Neumann; Optimal criteria; Pedestrian movement; Spatial layout; Structural design","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304.PKOMP.6313169, 304.PKOMP.6316019)","Funding text 1: Research experiment reported here is pursued under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) by Ministry of Education Malaysia for “Enhancing Genetic Algorithm for Spatial Layout Design Optimization with Pedestrian Simulation in a Panic Situation” [203.PKOMP.6711534] and Bridging Grant by Universiti Sains Malaysia for “Pedestrian Simulation Model for Clogging Detection and Survival Prediction in a Fire Spreading Situation” [304.PKOMP.6316019].

Deep learning, with its ability to extract high-level representations from multimodal data, has become a popular approach for cross-modal retrieval. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of deep learning techniques for cross-modal retrieval including 37 papers published in recent years. The review is organized into four main sections, covering traditional subspace learning methods, deep learning, and machine learning-based approaches, techniques based on large multi-modal models, and an analysis of datasets used in the field of cross-modal retrieval. We compare and analyze the performance of different deep learning methods on benchmark datasets, the result shows that although a large number of innovative methods have been proposed, there are still some problems that need to be solved, such as multi-modal feature alignment, multi-modal feature fusion, and subspace learning, as well as specialized datasets.  © 2013 IEEE.","cross-modal retrieval; Deep learning; multi-modal learning; representation learning","Benchmarking; Large dataset; Learning systems; Modal analysis; Cross-modal; Cross-modal retrieval; Deep learning; Learning methods; Multi-modal; Multi-modal data; Multi-modal learning; Representation learning; State of the art; Subspace learning; Deep learning","","","","","PHC-Hibiscus; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (PRGS/1/2021/ICT02/USM/02/1); Ministère de l'Europe et des Affaires Étrangères, MEAE, (MyPAIR/1/2020/ICT02/USM//1); Department of Education of Zhejiang Province, ZPDE, (Y202147706)","This work was supported in part by the Prototype Research Grant Scheme (PRGS) through the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under Grant PRGS/1/2021/ICT02/USM/02/1, in part by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education of China for their financial support through the General Research Project under Grant Y202147706, and in part by the Hubert Curien Partnership (PHC-Hibiscus) Research Grant Scheme by the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under Grant MyPAIR/1/2020/ICT02/USM//1.","Hochreiter S., Schmidhuber J., Long short-term memory, Neural Comput, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); Hardoon D.R., Szedmak S., Shawe-Taylor J., Canonical correlation analysis: An overview with application to learning methods, Neural Comput, 16, 12, pp. 2639-2664, (2004); Guo C., Wu D., Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based multiview learning: An overview, (2019); Rasiwasia N., Pereira J.C., Coviello E., Doyle G., Lanckriet G.R.G., Levy R., Vasconcelos N., A new approach to cross-modal multimedia retrieval, Proc. 18th ACM Int.

In the previous work, we have confirmed that corridor with less than 90° turning angle has negative impact to the pedestrians walking behaviour due to the tendency of the pedestrians to slow down their motion when approaching the turning of the corridor. This restrict the flow of walkers during high-density situation and cause congestion near that turning of the corridor. In this contribution, empirical data collected from previous experimental work is utilised to further study the effect of turning angle on the evacuation behaviour. The simulations of walking through angled-corridor were reproduced which reflects evacuation scenarios. Three different types of angled-corridor are taken into consideration (a 60°-, a 90°-, and a 135°-angled-corridors) with different sets of number of pedestrians (NOP: 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100). Three metrics of evacuation behaviour measurement are reported: (1) inflexion points, (2) escape time, and (3) interaction force. Inflexion point is used to evaluate the restriction flow occurred during the evacuation. From the results, the 60° angled-corridor contained the highest number of inflexion points. With the highest number of inflexion points, the escape time for the 60° angled-corridor is 14.8% to 24% longer compared to the other two types of angled-corridors. This shows that this kind of angled-corridor need to be avoided in the future design of walkways. On top of that, the 60° angled-corridor also gives the maximum interaction force with 213.75 N. This reconfirmed that the corridor with less than 90° turning angle is not suitable to be built as a walkway. This work is relevant to be studied due to its immediate applications in assessment of crowd safety for building egress. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PAWAM/60313040)","The authors would like to thank the sponsorship of this study, Universiti Sains Malaysia, under Short Term Grant 2016 (304/PAWAM/60313040).","Rahman N.A., Alias N.A., Sukor N.S.A., Halim H., Gotoh H., Hassan F.H., IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 572, (2019); Shiwakoti N., Sarvi M., Rose G., Burd M., Transportation Research Record, 2234, pp. 97-104, (2011); Dias C., Sarvi M., Shiwakoti N., Burd M., Transportation Research Record, 2312, pp. 120-127, (2012); Gotoh H., Harada E., Andoh E., Safety Science, 50, pp. 326-332, (2012); Harada E., Gotoh H., Rahman N.B.A., Safety Science, 79, pp. 105-115, (2015); Rahman N.A., Abustan M.S., Mat N.C., Gotoh H., Harada E., Applied Mechanics & Materials, 802, (2015); Langston P.A., Masling R., Asmar B.N., Safety Science, 44, pp. 395-417, (2006); Smith R.A., Lim L.B., Safety Science, 18, pp. 329-335, (1995)","N.A.

The implementation of machine learning approaches in flood prediction may reduce all the risk factors. Machine learning is one of the method that provide better performances and it is cost-effective and recently used among hydrologists. However, the capability of each machine learning algorithm is different for each type of tasks which is called generalization problem. Thus, for this research, three machine learning methods which are Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) is chosen for flood prediction model. Each of machine learning algorithms are built and trained in order for they to work accordingly with two different datasets. The aim of this research project is to investigate the performance of three selected machine learning algorithms and compared their accuracy. ANN has shown promising results with the highest performance accuracy of 98% in dataset 1 and 77.10% in dataset 2. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The provision of timely arrival time information is thus vital for passengers to minimize their waiting time and improve riders' confidence in the public transportation system, directly promoting more ridership. Multiple buses are commonly observed to arrive at a bus stop every hour. In this research, the prediction of estimated time of arrival (ETA) of buses is translated into a multi-label classification problem. Using buses historical global positioning system (GPS) arrival time, neural network models (ANN) are shown to be reliable solutions for the problem, and ensemble of neural networks are explored for more relevant output. The experimental results demonstrate that 77-78% of the time, ANN models are able to accurately predict arrival time of buses. The neural network models are able to outperform the other algorithms (i.e. Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes) in the classification of multi-label arrival times by up to 8% based on performance metrics such as hamming loss, accuracy, and F1 scores. Among the ensemble models, Random A-labelsets (RAkEL) with 2-labelsets and 3-labelsets outperform the single neural network by 2-3% in multi-label accuracy and F1 scores. The findings are convincing for us to further explore other problem transformation and ensemble approaches in the future. © 2017 IEEE.","Adaboost; Bus Arrival time estimation; Ensemble; GPS; multi-label classification;

For example, a well designed public building such as a train station or hospital should allow for the smooth flow of a large number of people. In extreme cases, design can be so poor that during emergency evacuations people have been crushed to death. It is vital that design takes into account the smooth flow of pedestrians. In this paper we make an initial exploration in using pedestrian flow combined with heuristic search to assist in the automatic design for spatial layout planning. Using pedestrian simulations, the activity of crowds can be used to study the consequences of different spatial layouts.

Path planning undoubtedly plays an important role in mobile robot navigation, thus becoming one of the most researched topics in the field of robotics. The metaheuristic algorithms have been extensively studied in recent years to solve the path planning problems the same way as the optimization problems were solved, or in other words, plan the optimum path for the robot to navigate from the starting point to the destination. In this research, a mobile robot is launched to find its path from the starting point to the destination in three different simulated environments using a proposed hybrid metaheuristic algorithm between Particle Swarm Optimization and Fringe Search Algorithm, named PSOFS, and its simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) capability. During runtime, the path is optimized by considering the path length. The performance of PSOFS for local path planning is compared against two existing algorithms by evaluating the path smoothness as well as robot safety. The results showed that PSOFS has successfully generated shorter, smoother, and safer paths than the algorithms for mobile robot navigation in unknown indoor environments. © 2013 IEEE.","fringe search algorithm; hybrid metaheuristics; Local path planning; mobile robot navigation; particle swarm optimization; unknown indoor environments","Mobile robots; Navigation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Robot programming; SLAM robotics; Dynamic environments; Hybrid metaheuristic algorithms; Meta heuristic algorithm; Mobile Robot Navigation; Optimization problems; Path planning problems; Simulated environment; Simultaneous localization and mapping; Indoor positioning systems","","","","","Hubert Curien Partnership France-Malaysia Hibiscus; PHC-Hibiscus; University of Southern Maine, USM, (PELECT/6315298, PKOMP/6315262); Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia, KPM","This work was supported in part by the USM Short Term Grant PKOMP/6315262 and Grant PELECT/6315298, in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Grant 203.PELECT.6071430, and in part by the Hubert Curien Partnership France-Malaysia Hibiscus (PHC-Hibiscus) Grant 203.PKOMP.6782005.","Yasuda Y.D.V., Martins L.E.G., Cappabianco F.A.M., Autonomous visual navigation for mobile robots: A systematic literature review, Acm Comput.

This study focused on human activity in video sequences acquired with an RGB camera because of its vast range of real-world applications. It uses two-stream ConvNet to extract spatial and temporal information and proposes a fine-tuned deep neural network. Moreover, the transfer learning paradigm is adopted to extract varied and fixed frames while reusing object identification information. Six state-of-the-art pre-trained models are exploited to find the best model for spatial feature extraction. For temporal sequence, this study uses dense optical flow following the two-stream ConvNet and Bidirectional Long Short TermMemory (BiLSTM) to capture longtermdependencies. Two state-of-the-art datasets, UCF101 andHMDB51, are used for evaluation purposes. In addition, seven state-of-the-art optimizers are used to fine-tune the proposed network parameters. Furthermore, this study utilizes an ensemble mechanism to aggregate spatial-temporal features using a four-stream Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), where two streams use RGB data. In contrast, the other uses optical flow images. Finally, the proposed ensemble approach using max hard voting outperforms state-ofthe- art methods with 96.30% and 90.07% accuracies on the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

However, during the discretization of firefly algorithm, one of the FA’s characteristics, i.e. the movement of a dimmer firefly towards a brighter firefly is unapparent as the movement are random. Thus, in this paper, the usage of swap operation as the movement strategy is proposed. The proposed algorithm, Swap-based Discrete Firefly Algorithm (SDFA), is then integrated with Nearest-Neighborhood initialization, reset strategy and Fixed Radius Near Neighbor 2-opt operator (FRNN 2-opt). The proposed algorithm is tested on 45 TSP instances and is compared with several states-of-the-art algorithm. The findings of this research show that the proposed algorithm performs competitively compared to the Discrete Firefly Algorithm, the Discrete Cuckoo Search, the Discrete Bat Algorithm, the Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and the Discrete Bacterial Memetic Evolutionary Algorithm. On average, SDFA reports a percentage deviation of 0.02% from known optimum for TSP instances with dimension range from 14 to 318 cities. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Combinatorial Optimization; Discrete optimization; Local search; Nature-inspired algorithm","Artificial intelligence; Bioluminescence; Combinatorial optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Problem solving; Traveling salesman problem; Discrete optimization; Discrete optimization problems; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Local search; Memetic evolutionary algorithms; Nature inspired algorithms; Nearest neighborhood; Percentage deviation; Optimization","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","Acknowledgement.

Backpropagation method was used for the counter measure and prediction analysis of the epidemic disease. The predictive analysis based on the backpropagation method can be determine via machine learning process that promotes the artificial intelligent in pattern recognition, statistics and features selection. This computational learning process will be integrated with data mining by measuring the score output as the classifier to the given set of input features through classification technique. The classification technique is the features selection of the disease dissemination factors that likely have strong interconnection between each other in causing infectious disease outbreaks. The predictive analysis of epidemic disease in determining the infected area was introduced in this preliminary study by using the backpropagation method in observation of other's findings. This study will classify the epidemic disease dissemination factors as the features for weight adjustment on the prediction of epidemic disease outbreaks. Through this preliminary study, the predictive analysis is proven to be effective method in determining the epidemic disease infected area by minimizing the error value through the features classification. © 2017 Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Boivin G., Predicting Influenza Infections during Epidemics with Use of a Clinical Case Definition., Clinical Infectious Diseases, 31, 5, pp. 1166-1169, (2000); Ravi D., Deep Learning for Health Informatics., IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 21, 1, pp. 4-21, (2017); Shope R., Global Climate Change and Infectious Diseases., Environmental Health Perspectives, 96, pp. 171-174, (1991); Shuman E.K., Global Climate Change and Infectious Diseases., New England Journal of Medicine, 362, 12, pp. 1061-1063, (2010); Sadilek A., Kautz H., Silenzio V., Predicting Disease Transmission from Geo-Tagged Micro-Blog Data, Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 136-142, (2012); Andrick B., Infectious Disease and Climate Change: Detecting Contributing Factors and Predicting Future Outbreaks, Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 1997.

Rationally, there will be changes to the pedestrian walking behavior when approaching and walking through angled-corridor due to the turning angle. This could trigger restrictions to the flow of walkers and causing congestion near that turning angle. Hence, this study is purposely to investigate empirically the characteristics of pedestrians when walking through different angled-corridors (60°, 90° and 135°). Controlled experiment of pedestrians walking through built angled-corridors was conducted at the Multipurpose Hall of USM, involving 60 local undergraduate students. Thirty walking tasks were performed by considering different number of pedestrians (NOP: 1, 15, 30, 45 and 60). Video-based tracking of pedestrian's trajectories walking through angled-corridors was performed and effects on walking characteristics and velocity were discussed. It is found that, pedestrian not necessarily choose the shortest path while walking, but prefer to occupy all space available to suit their own speed and comfort. As the degree of corridor increases, the impacts to pedestrian walking velocity become less. However, in response to the increase in number of pedestrians, the development of changing track can be witnessed. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Condensed matter physics; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Materials science; Controlled experiment; Pedestrian dynamics; Turning angles; Undergraduate students; Video-based tracking; Walking behavior; Walking through; Walking velocity; Students","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PAWAM/60313040)","The authors would like to thank the sponsorship of this study, Universiti Sains Malaysia, under Short Term Grant 2016 (304/PAWAM/60313040).","Guo R.Y., Et al., Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 21, 1, pp. 103-113, (2012); Aghabayk K., Et al., Transportation Research Record, 2490, 1, pp. 76-83, (2015); Liao W., Et al., Transportation Research Procedia, 2, pp. 26-33, (2014); Zhang J., Et al., Transportation Research Procedia, 2, pp. 51-59, (2014); Liu X.D., Et al., Transportation Research Procedia, 2, pp. 34-42, (2014); Seyfried A., Et al., Transportation Science, 43, 3, pp. 395-406, (2009); Tobias K., Et al., Theory and Experiment, 10, (2006); Ye R., Et al., Theory and Experiment, 4, (2019); Gaire N., Et al., Journal of Accessibility and Design for All, 7, pp. 56-75, (2017); Shiwakoti N., Et al., 37th Australasian Transport Research Forum (ATRF), 1, (2015); Dias C., Et al., Transportation Research Record, 2312, 1, pp. 120-127, (2012); Dias C., Et al., Transportation Research Record, 2421, 1, pp. 41-50, (2014); Dias C., Et al., Transportation Research Procedia, 2, pp. 19-25, (2014); Gorrini A., Et al., Transportation Research Record, 1, pp. 1-10, (2013); (1984)","","Sandu A.V.; Abdullah M.M.A.B.; Vizureanu P.; Ghazali C.M.R.; Sandu I.","Institute of Physics Publishing","","2019 International Conference on Innovative Research, ICIR EUROINVENT 2019","16 May 2019 through 17 May 2019","Iasi","150123","17578981","","","","English","IOP Conf.

The proposed model presents a non-static fire-spreading behavior to avoid considerable discrepancies between reality and simulation. The proposed model adopts a circular fire front shape based on spiral fire movement. Moreover, four dynamic parameters are introduced to simplify the decision-making process of a pedestrian's movement inside the layout during fire spreading. In addition, the proposed model includes the number of victims (i.e., caught in the fire) and the number of pedestrians who were evacuated safely. By analyzing these variables, a suitable evacuation plan enabling the control of crowd movements in different situations such as fire disasters can be consequently designed.","Cellular automaton; Circular fire front shape; Pedestrian simulation; Spiral fire movement","","","","","","","","Alidmat O.K.A., Hassan F.H., Khader A.T., Cellular automata model for pedestrian evacuation in fire spreading conditions, In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Computing and Informatics, pp. 293-299, (2015); Almughrabi N., Hundreds dead following stampede at hajj pilgrimage, (2015); Benson T., Fire kills 283 at supermarket in paraguay, (2004); Bo Y., Yong-Gang W., Cheng W., A GIS-based simulation for occupant evacuation in an amusement buildin, Paper presented at the Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (CAR), 2010 2nd International Asia Conference on, 3, pp. 274-277, (2010); Cao S.-C., Song W.-G., Liu X.-D., Mu N., Simulation of pedestrian evacuation in a room under fire emergency, Procedia Engineering, 71, pp. 403-409, (2014); Conachy J., Christmas night fire kills 311 in central China, (2000); Curiac D.I., Banias O., Volosencu C., Pescaru D., Cellular Automata Based Simulation for Smoke and Fire Spreading in Large Buildings, Paper presented at the International Conference on Development, Energy, Environment, Economics (DEEE'10), (2010); Darlington S., Brocchetto M., Ford D., Fire rips through crowded Brazil nightclub, killing 233, (2013); Malaysia, Monthly Manufacturing Statistics, CHART, 54, pp. 53.5-54.2, (2012); Finney M.A., An overview of FlamMap fire modeling capabilities, Paper presented at the Fuels management-how to measure success: conference proceedings, pp. 28-30, (2006); Georgoudas I.G., Sirakoulis G.C., Andreadis I.T., An intelligent cellular automaton model for crowd evacuation in fire spreading conditi, Paper presented at the Tools with Artificial Intelligence, 2007.

The researcher's focus is shifting towards this area due to its vast range of real-life applications to assist in daily living. Therefore, it is necessary to validate its performance on standard benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art systems before applying it in real-life applications. The primary objective of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is to collect existing research on video-based human activity recognition, summarize, and analyze the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures regarding various methodologies, challenges, and issues. The top five scientific databases (such as ACM, IEEE, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Taylor Francis) are accessed to accompany this systematic study by summarizing 70 different research articles on human activity recognition after critical review. Human activity recognition in videos is a challenging problem due to its diverse and complex nature. For accurate video classification, extraction of both spatial and temporal features from video sequences is essential. Therefore, this SLR focuses on reviewing the recent advancements in stratified self-deriving feature-based deep learning architectures. Furthermore, it explores various deep learning techniques available for HAR, challenges researchers to face to build a robust model, and state-of-the-art datasets used for evaluation. This SLR intends to provide a baseline for video-based human activity recognition research while emphasizing several challenges regarding human activity recognition accuracy in video sequences using deep neural architectures. © 2013 IEEE.","Activity recognition; computer vision; deep learning; SLR; Spatio-temporal features","Benchmarking; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Video recording; Human activity recognition; Learning architectures; Neural architectures; Real-life applications; State-of-the-art system; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Video classification; Deep learning","","","","","School of Computer Sciences and University Sains Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/TK03/USM/02/1)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) with Project Code: FRGS/1/2020/TK03/USM/02/1, School of Computer Sciences and University Sains Malaysia (USM).","Ramamurthy S.R., Roy N., Recent trends in machine learning for human activity recognitionfla survey, Wiley Interdiscipl.

One of the features in the CA movement model is to find the shortest path distance that will navigate the pedestrian movement towards point of interest in the fastest of time. Nowadays, there are many path navigation systems that were constructed by using the pre-defined movement simulation based on the static obstacles’ layout. However, the pre-defined movement simulation is not able to highlight the near-realistic movement of the pedestrian due to the dynamic obstacle’s avoidance and physical collision that will affect the pedestrian movement direction’s selection and safety. Hence, this research has simulated the enhanced transition direction of the CA based pedestrian movement using the optimal Moore Neighborhood transition method and has proposed the Pythagorean Theorem for the shortest distance path finding for assisting the pedestrian direction selection. This research has proven that the enhanced movement transition direction and the implementation of Pythagorean Theorem able to construct an intelligent and near-realistic pedestrian simulation that able to evacuate in fastest time (<25 s) from the selected spatial layout design compared to the transition method based pedestrian movement simulation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Cellular automata; Moore neighborhood transition; Pedestrian movement; Pythagorean theorem; Shortest distance","Air navigation; Cellular automata; Computer vision; Navigation systems; Robotics; Robots; Direction selection; Microscopic movements; Movement Simulation; Pedestrian movement; Pedestrian simulation; Pythagorean theorem; Shortest distance; Shortest distance paths; Pedestrian safety","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (203.PKOMP.6711534); Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (1001.PKOMP.8014073, 304.PKOMP.6316019)","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements Research experiment is pursued under the FRGS grant by Ministry of Education Malaysia [203.PKOMP.6711534], Bridging Grant by Universiti Sains Malaysia [304.PKOMP.6316019] and Research University Grant by Universiti Sains Malaysia [1001.PKOMP.8014073].; Funding text 2: Research experiment is pursued under the FRGS grant by Ministry of Education Malaysia [203.PKOMP.6711534], Bridging Grant by Universiti Sains Malaysia [304.PKOMP.6316019] and Research University Grant by Universiti Sains Malaysia [1001.PKOMP.8014073].","Chiang P.N., Taaffe K., Analysis of passenger flow in airport terminal, 2014 Tenth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing, (2014); Diakite A.A., Zlatanova S., Spatial subdivision of complex indoor environments for 3D indoor navigation, Int.

Rising earth temperatures add to the higher potential contribution of forest fires. Many forest fire hazard index calculation methods have been developed to analyze the impact categories arising from changes in meteorological parameters. Each calculation method has advantages in calculating the magnitude of the potential. One method of calculating the forest fire hazard index is needed from many choices of methods that have the highest level of accuracy to predict the potential for a fire. A comparative study of the methods will be validated and guide the best calculating procedure to be implemented for the prediction. Predictions that have excellent accuracy and precision can be used as an early warning system. This study will predict forest fires for each calculation method using the Backpropagation algorithm, then analyze the accuracy of the prediction results using Relative Operating Characteristics (ROC). The methods compared include the methods that have been used in Indonesia as a country that has tropical rainforests, namely Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI), Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (MFFDI), and Fire Weather Index (FWI). Through a comparative study of this calculation model, it is concluded that MFFDI is the best method of calculating the fire hazard index with an accuracy value of 0.917 and a precision value of 0.667. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The authors were unable to find a comprehensive study on crime hotspot detection and prediction while conducting this SLR. Therefore, to the best of author's knowledge, this study is the premier attempt to critically analyze the existing literature along with presenting potential challenges faced by current crime hotspot detection and prediction systems. The SLR is conducted by thoroughly consulting top five scientific databases (such as IEEE, Science Direct, Springer, Scopus, and ACM), and synthesized 49 different studies on crime hotspot detection and prediction after critical review. This study unfolds the following major aspects: 1) the impact of data mining and machine learning approaches, especially clustering techniques in crime hotspot detection; 2) the utility of time series analysis techniques and deep learning techniques in crime trend prediction; 3) the inclusion of spatial and temporal information in crime datasets making the crime prediction systems more accurate and reliable; 4) the potential challenges faced by the state-of-the-art techniques and the future research directions. Moreover, the SLR aims to provide a core foundation for the research on spatiooral crime prediction applications while highlighting several challenges related to the accuracy of crime hotspot detection and prediction applications. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..
