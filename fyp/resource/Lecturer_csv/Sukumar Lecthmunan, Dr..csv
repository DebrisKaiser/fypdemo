The insufficient knowledge of the whole agricultural production system and conventional ways of irrigation have limited agricultural yields in the past. The remote sensing innovations recently implemented in agriculture have dramatically revolutionized production efficiency by offering unparalleled opportunities for convenient, versatile, and quick collection of land images to collect critical details on the crop’s conditions. These innovations have enabled automated data collection, simulation, and interpretation based on crop analytics facilitated by deep learning techniques. This paper aims to reveal the transformative patterns of old Chinese agrarian development and fruit production by focusing on the major crop production (from 1980 to 2050) taking into account various forms of data from fruit production (e.g., apples, bananas, citrus fruits, pears, and grapes). In this study, we used production data for different fruits grown in China to predict the future production of these fruits. The study employs deep neural networks to project future fruit production based on the statistics issued by China’s National Bureau of Statistics on the total fruit growth output for this period. The proposed method exhibits encouraging results with an accuracy of 95.56% calculating by accuracy formula based on fruit production variation. Authors further provide recommendations on the AGR-DL (agricultural deep learning) method being helpful for developing countries. The results suggest that the agricultural development in China is acceptable but demands more improvement and government needs to prioritize expanding the fruit production by establishing new strategies for cultivators to boost their performance. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the existing clustering methods cannot represent the uncertainty and imprecision in cluster assignment caused by the tendency of clusters to overlap and the diversity among views. To surmount this issue, in this paper, we propose an adaptive weighted multi-view evidential clustering (WMVWC) method based on the framework of belief functions. The proposed WMVEC can be viewed as a multi-view version of conventional evidential c-means clustering. We construct the objective function of WMVEC by integrating the learning of view weights and credal partition into a unified framework, and design an optimization scheme to obtain the optimal results of WMVEC. Specifically, the view weight can measure the contribution of each view in clustering. The credal partition can provide a deeper understanding of the data structure by allowing samples to belong not only to singleton clusters, but also to a union of different singleton clusters, called meta-cluster. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed WMVEC with respect to other state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.

In recent years, the growth of digital libraries and video databases makes it more challenging and important to extract useful information from raw data to prevent and detect the crimes from the database automatically. Street crime snatching and theft detection is the major challenge in video mining. The main target is to select features/objects which usually occurs at the time of snatching. The number of moving targets imitates the performance, speed and amount of motion in the anomalous video. The dataset used in this paper is Snatch 101; the videos in the dataset are further divided into frames. The frames are labelled and segmented for training. We applied the VGG19 Convolutional Neural Network architecture algorithm and extracted the features of objects and compared them with original video features and objects. The main contribution of our research is to create frames from the videos and then label the objects. The objects are selected from frames where we can detect anomalous activities. The proposed system is never used before for crime prediction, and it is computationally efficient and effective as compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Consequently, this paper embraces a systematic literature review to classify and analyze SOSE Challenges claimed in research communities from January 2009 to October 2014. First, the search string was applied to each selected database and the title, abstract and keywords of the potentially relevant primary studies were examined where 693 primary studies were found relevant. Then, the full texts of the 693 relevant studies were critically reviewed. As a result, 91 primary studies with 122 claimed SOSE challenges were identified and recorded. The results revealed quality of service (QOS) as the major SOSE Challenge, it is responsible for about 45% of the total SOSE challenges claimed for the period under review. Further investigation revealed Security as the main attribute responsible for placing QOS as the major SOSE challenge. It is recommended that research effort is required to improve the security of SOA applications. In addition, other areas that require research effort are Service provision and integration. © 2015 SERSC.","Challenges; SOSE; SOSE challenges; Systematic literature review","","","","","","","","Arsanjani A., Zhang L.-J., Ellis M., Allam A., Channabasavaiah K., S3: A service-oriented reference architecture, IT professional, 9, 3, pp. 10-17, (2007); Grimshaw J., McAuley L.M., Bero L.A., Grilli R., Oxman A.D., Ramsay C., Vale L., Zwarenstein M., Systematic reviews of the effectiveness of quality improvement strategies and programmes, Quality and safety in health care, 12, 4, pp. 298-303, (2003); De Oliveira L.B.R., Felizardo K.R., Feitosa D., Nakagawa E.Y., Reference models and reference architectures based on service-oriented architecture: a systematic review, Software Architecture, pp. 360-367, (2010); Dyba T., Dingsoyr T., Hanssen G.K., Applying systematic reviews to diverse study types: An experience report, Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement, pp. 225-234, (2007); Frunza O., Inkpen D., Matwin S., Klement W., O'blenis P., Exploiting the systematic review protocol for classification of medical abstracts, Artificial intelligence in medicine, 51, 1, pp. 17-25, (2011); Gu Q., Lago P., A model for exploring the service-oriented software engineering (sose) challenge, 2nd European young researchers workshop on service oriented computing (YRSOC), pp. 44-49, (2007); Gu Q., Lago P., Exploring service-oriented system engineering challenges: a systematic literature review, Service Oriented Computing and Applications, 3, 3, pp. 171-188, (2009); Keele S., Guidelines for performing systematic literature reviews in software engineering, Technical report, (2007); Kitchenham B., Procedures for performing systematic reviews, Keele, UK, Keele University, 33, pp. 1-26, (2004); Li Z., Zhang H., O'Brien L., Facing service-oriented system engineering challenges: an organizational perspective, Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA), 2010 IEEE International Conference on IEEE, pp. 1-4, (2010); Stevenson A., Waite M., Concise Oxford English Dictionary: Book & CD-ROM Set, (2011); Letchmunan S., Pragmatic Cost Estimation for Web Applications, (2012); Kitchenham B.A., Mendes E., Travassos G.H., Cross versus within-company cost estimation studies: A systematic review, Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on, 33, 5, pp. 316-329, (2007); William M.K., Measurement Validity Types, Retrieved from Research methods knowledge base, (2008); Swientek M., Bleimann U., Dowland P.S., Service-Oriented Architecture: Performance Issues and Approaches, Proceedings of the Seventh International Network Conference INCcLulu.com, (2008); Roshen W., SOA-Based Enterprise Integration, A step-by-step guide to service-based application integration, (2009)","","","Science and Engineering Research Support Society","","","","","","17389984","","","","English","Int.

The existing emergency routes are designed based on the shortest path to the nearest egress in a vacant layout. This research aims to design an emergency route plan in a realistic closed layout with interior arrangements and crowds as static and dynamic impediments that cause movement divergence and misdirection that affect evacuation time. This research proposes an automated emergency route design using Cellular Automata (CA) based pedestrian simulation in a realistic layout. The simulation was integrated with the Pythagorean Theorem (PT) and Dijkstra's Algorithm (DA) to imitate human exit-finding behaviour during evacuation. The results showed that PT is viable in layouts with static obstacles, requiring 20 % less travel distances and evacuation time than DA with similar experiment sets. However, the DA approach results have become on par with the PT in a layout with dynamic and static obstacles. DA outperforms PT in densely populated regions, while PT outperforms DA in less populated regions. © 2022, DAAAM International Vienna.

These provided evidence of the strength of agile methodologies as a strategy that can speed up the development of rhythms and growth of innovation. Managing a project involves a complexity of requirements and developmental processes. This provides challenges to the project manager as he is accountable for the failure of a completed project. As such he is required to tackle any problems by adopting agile methodology during the development process. In Malaysia there is little research done to examine the behavior of the agile project manager. This study aims to analyze the behavior when project managers adopt agile in managing the development projects. Moreover, a review of the relevant literature has helped in developing an understanding of the agile project manager's behavior as this is necessary for them to become more agile inside development projects. For that reason, this paper has identified seven behaviors that the manager needs to adopt during software development process. These include Leadership, Openness, Results Orientation, Ethics, Communication, Strategic and Creative and Innovative. This paper contributes to the relevant theory by developing taxonomy of the agile project manager's behavior. Practitioners can use this taxonomy as a sensitizing device that helps the manager to consider behavior that promotes success of their projects. This is important to ensure an increase productivity and profitability, which are the business strategies of software development projects. © 2014 IEEE.","agile behavior; agile methodologies; agile project manager; communication; creative; ethics; innovative; leadership; openness; result orientation; strategic","Communication; Ethical aspects; Managers; Philosophical aspects; Planning; Software design; Taxonomies; agile behavior; Agile Methodologies; creative; innovative; leadership; openness; Project managers; strategic; Project management","","","","","","","Augustine B.S., Payne B., Sencindiver F., ManagementD : Steering, 48, 12, pp. 85-89, (2005); Attarzadeh I., Siew Hock O., Modern project management d: Essential skills and techniques, Commun.

In this paper, we used a structured dataset of Santander bank, which is published on a data science and machine learning competition site (kaggle. com) to predict whether a customer would make a transaction or not? The dataset consists of two classes, and it is imbalanced. To handle imbalance as well as to achieve the goal of prediction with the least log loss, we used a variety of methods and algorithms. The provided dataset is partitioned into two sets of 200,000 entries each for training and testing. 50% of data is kept hidden on their server for evaluation of the submission. A detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of datasets is performed to check the distributions of values. Correlation between features and importance of characteristics is calculated. To calculate the feature importance, random forest and decision trees are used. Furthermore, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis are used for dimensionality reduction. We have used 9 different algorithms including logistic regression (LR), Random forests (RF), Decision tree (DT), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Gradient boosting method (GBM), Category boost (CatBoost), Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive boosting (Adaboost) and Light gradient boosting (LigtGBM) method on the dataset. We proposed LighGBM as a regression problem on the dataset and it outperforms the stateof-the-art algorithms with 85% accuracy. Later, we have used fine-tune hyperparameters for our dataset and implemented them in combination with the LighGBM. This tuning improves performance, and we have achieved 89% accuracy. © 2013 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization.","AdaBoost; Banking; CatBoost; Dimensionality reduction; DT; EDA; GBM; Hyperparameter;

Countries are spending a substantial amount of their budgets to control and prevent crime. However, limited efforts have been made in the crime prediction area due to the deficiency of spatiotemporal crime data. Several machine learning, deep learning, and time series analysis techniques are exploited, but accuracy issues prevail. Thus, this study proposed a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Exponential Smoothing (ES) hybrid for crime forecasting. The proposed technique is evaluated using New York City crime data from 2010-2017. The proposed approach outperformed as compared to state-of-the-art Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) with low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) (0.3738, 0.3891, 0.3433, 0.3964), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)(13.146, 13.669, 13.104, 13.77), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (9.837, 10.896, 10.598, 10.721). Therefore, the proposed technique can help law enforcement agencies to prevent and control crime by forecasting crime patterns. Copyright: © 2022 Butt et al.

By applying intelligent data analysis techniques, many interesting patterns are identified for the early and onset detection and prevention of several fatal diseases. Diabetes mellitus is an extremely life-threatening disease because it contributes to other lethal diseases, i.e., heart, kidney, and nerve damage. In this paper, a machine learning based approach has been proposed for the classification, early-stage identification, and prediction of diabetes. Furthermore, it also presents an IoT-based hypothetical diabetes monitoring system for a healthy and affected person to monitor his blood glucose (BG) level. For diabetes classification, three different classifiers have been employed, i.e., random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and logistic regression (LR). For predictive analysis, we have employed long short-term memory (LSTM), moving averages (MA), and linear regression (LR). For experimental evaluation, a benchmark PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset is used. During the analysis, it is observed that MLP outperforms other classifiers with 86.08% of accuracy and LSTM improves the significant prediction with 87.26% accuracy of diabetes. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed approach is also performed with existing state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating the adaptability of the proposed approach in many public healthcare applications.  © 2021 Umair Muneer Butt et al.","","Delivery of Health Care;

However, a substantial increase in the urban population from the last few years poses challenges related to resource management, safety, and security. To ensure the safety and security in the smart city environment, this paper presents a novel approach by empowering the authorities to better visualize the threats, by identifying and predicting the highly-reported crime zones in the smart city. To this end, it first investigates the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to detect the hot-spots that have a higher risk of crime occurrence. Second, for crime prediction, Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) is exploited in each dense crime region to predict the number of crime incidents in the future with spatial and temporal information. The proposed HDBSCAN and SARIMA based crime prediction model is evaluated on ten years of crime data (2008-2017) for New York City (NYC). The accuracy of the model is measured by considering different time scenarios such as the year-wise, (i.e., for each year), and for the total considered duration of ten years using an 80:20 ratio. The 80% of data was used for training and 20% for testing. The proposed approach outperforms with an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 11.47 as compared to the highest scoring DBSCAN based method with MAE 27.03.  © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; Citizen security; crime prediction; safe city; smart cities","Artificial intelligence; Crime; Forecasting; Hierarchical clustering; Safety engineering; Smart city; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise; Mean absolute error; Prediction model; Resource management; Safety and securities; Temporal information; Urban population; Predictive analytics","","","","","Fadratul Hafinaz Hassan; School of Computer Sciences USM; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (FRGS/1/2020/TK03/USM/02/1)","Corresponding authors: Umair Muneer Butt (umair@student.usm.my), Sukumar Letchmunan (sukumar@usm.my), and Fadratul Hafinaz Hassan (fadratul@usm.my) This work was supported in part by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) through Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Grant FRGS/1/2020/TK03/USM/02/1, and in part by the School of Computer Sciences USM.","Spencer N., Butler D., Cities: The century of the city, Nature, 467, 7318, pp. 900-901, (2010); Cicirelli F., Guerrieri A., Spezzano G., Vinci A., An edge-based platform for dynamic smart city applications, Future Gener.

Case-based reasoning (CBR) has been shown to be a reasonably effective estimation strategy, although it has not been widely explored in the context of web applications. This paper reports on a study carried out on a subset of the ISBSG dataset to examine the optimal number of analogies that should be used in making a prediction. The results show that it is not possible to select such a value with confidence, and that, in common with other findings in different domains, the effectiveness of CBR is hampered by other factors including the characteristics of the underlying dataset (such as the spread of data and presence of outliers) and the calculation employed to evaluate the distance function (in particular, the treatment of numeric and categorical data). © The Authors.

To address this challenge, prioritizing test cases during test execution is essential as it aims to swiftly identify the hidden faults in the software. In the literature, several techniques for test case prioritization (TCP) have been proposed and evaluated. However, existing weight-based TCP techniques often overlook the true diversity coverage of test cases, resulting in the use of average-based weighting practices and a lack of systematic calculation for test case weights. Our research revolves around prioritizing test cases by considering multiple code coverage criteria. The study presents a novel diversity technique that calculates a diversity coverage score for each test case. This score serves as a weight to effectively rank the test cases. To evaluate the proposed technique, an experiment was conducted using five open-source programs and measured its performance in terms of the average percentage of fault detection (APFD). A comparison was made against an existing technique. The results revealed that the proposed technique significantly improved the fault detection rate compared to the existing approach. It is worth noting that this study is the first of its kind to incorporate the true diversity score of test cases into the TCP process. The findings of our research make valuable contributions to the field of regression testing by enhancing the effectiveness of the testing process through the utilization of diversity-based weighting techniques. © 2023, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Most available models try to predict availability of a software during its life cycle but there are very few or no models that predict a software going days without a failure. Over the years, decision tree model have been used as a reliable technique for prediction. In this study, based on the sample data collected by John Musa of Bell Telephone Laboratories, a decision tree model has been used to predict the availability of a system going days without a failure. This study concluded that a decision tree model is able to decide availability of a software in terms of going days without a failure. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information","Decision tree model; Software availability; Software measurement; Software quality; Software reliability","","","","","","","","Aljahdali S., Sheta A.F., Habib M., Software reliability analysis using parametric and non-parametric methods, Proceedings of the ISCA 18th International Conference on Computers and Their Applications, pp. 1-4, (2003); Aljahdali S., Sheta A.F., Predicting the reliability of software systems using fuzzy logic, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations, pp. 36-40, (2011); Brocklehurst S., Littlewood B., Snell J., Recalibrating software reliability models, Software Eng.

This study focused on human activity in video sequences acquired with an RGB camera because of its vast range of real-world applications. It uses two-stream ConvNet to extract spatial and temporal information and proposes a fine-tuned deep neural network. Moreover, the transfer learning paradigm is adopted to extract varied and fixed frames while reusing object identification information. Six state-of-the-art pre-trained models are exploited to find the best model for spatial feature extraction. For temporal sequence, this study uses dense optical flow following the two-stream ConvNet and Bidirectional Long Short TermMemory (BiLSTM) to capture longtermdependencies. Two state-of-the-art datasets, UCF101 andHMDB51, are used for evaluation purposes. In addition, seven state-of-the-art optimizers are used to fine-tune the proposed network parameters. Furthermore, this study utilizes an ensemble mechanism to aggregate spatial-temporal features using a four-stream Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), where two streams use RGB data. In contrast, the other uses optical flow images. Finally, the proposed ensemble approach using max hard voting outperforms state-ofthe- art methods with 96.30% and 90.07% accuracies on the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Deep learning techniques have shown promising results in detecting and diagnosing brain diseases using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. These techniques involve training neural networks on large datasets of MRI images, allowing the networks to learn patterns and features indicative of different brain diseases. However, several challenges and limitations still need to be addressed further to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of these techniques. This paper implements a Feature Enhanced Stacked Auto Encoder (FESAE) model to detect brain diseases. The standard stack auto encoder’s results are trivial and not robust enough to boost the system’s accuracy. Therefore, the standard Stack Auto Encoder (SAE) is replaced with a Stacked Feature Enhanced Auto Encoder with a feature enhancement function to efficiently and effectively get non-trivial features with less activation energy from an image. The proposed model consists of four stages. First, pre-processing is performed to remove noise, and the greyscale image is converted to Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) to enhance feature details for discriminative feature extraction. Second, feature Extraction is performed to extract significant features for classification using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Channelization. Third, classification is performed to classify MRI images into four major classes: Normal, Tumor, Brain Stroke, and Alzheimer’s. Finally, the FESAE model outperforms the state-of-the-art, machine learning, and deep learning methods such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), SAE, Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) by achieving a high accuracy of 98.61% on a dataset of 2000 MRI images. The proposed model has significant potential for assisting radiologists in diagnosing brain diseases more accurately and improving patient outcomes. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Its usage has increased dramatically in recent years but not seen extensive application in EEG based Brain computer interface (BCI) problems. There is a wide range of classifiers which may not perform well, when used separately for classification problem but outperforms state-of-art algorithm when used as an ensemble, i.e., Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) is considered as best learning algorithms when time is embedded in input but not shown outstanding performance when used individually for EEG classification. On the contrary, it provided real good results when used as an ensemble. Aim: Aim of this study is how EEG signals can be classified using Ensembles methods; its importance and usage are described with experimental results. Approach: The approach that is being used is, combining different classifiers, i.e. Support vector machines, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Logistic Regression (LR) and see which classifiers work best with which ensemble technique for EEG classification’s problem. Datasets: Datasets are taken from well-known data resources, Kaggle, EEG data set of confused students. The second dataset is taken from GitHub having EEG signals with timestamps according to events, i.e., sound, light, etc. According to our results, the LSTM- ensemble outperformed all other algorithms in the case where time is embedded in data. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Brain Computer Interface (BCI); Classification; EEG signals; Ensemble methods","Brain; Brain computer interface; Decision trees; Human computer interaction; Learning algorithms; Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Data resources; EEG classification; Eeg datum; EEG signals; Ensemble learning; Ensemble techniques; Time stamps; Biomedical signal processing","","","","","","","Muresan R., Jurjut O., Moca V., Singer W., Nikolic D., The oscillation score: an efficient method for estimating oscillation strength in neuronal activity, J.

The researcher's focus is shifting towards this area due to its vast range of real-life applications to assist in daily living. Therefore, it is necessary to validate its performance on standard benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art systems before applying it in real-life applications. The primary objective of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is to collect existing research on video-based human activity recognition, summarize, and analyze the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures regarding various methodologies, challenges, and issues. The top five scientific databases (such as ACM, IEEE, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Taylor Francis) are accessed to accompany this systematic study by summarizing 70 different research articles on human activity recognition after critical review. Human activity recognition in videos is a challenging problem due to its diverse and complex nature. For accurate video classification, extraction of both spatial and temporal features from video sequences is essential. Therefore, this SLR focuses on reviewing the recent advancements in stratified self-deriving feature-based deep learning architectures. Furthermore, it explores various deep learning techniques available for HAR, challenges researchers to face to build a robust model, and state-of-the-art datasets used for evaluation. This SLR intends to provide a baseline for video-based human activity recognition research while emphasizing several challenges regarding human activity recognition accuracy in video sequences using deep neural architectures. © 2013 IEEE.","Activity recognition; computer vision; deep learning; SLR; Spatio-temporal features","Benchmarking; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Video recording; Human activity recognition; Learning architectures; Neural architectures; Real-life applications; State-of-the-art system; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Video classification; Deep learning","","","","","School of Computer Sciences and University Sains Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/TK03/USM/02/1)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) with Project Code: FRGS/1/2020/TK03/USM/02/1, School of Computer Sciences and University Sains Malaysia (USM).","Ramamurthy S.R., Roy N., Recent trends in machine learning for human activity recognitionfla survey, Wiley Interdiscipl.

Tackling these problems effectively requires digital leadership, a prominent idea in discussions about what abilities the managers need to be developed in the digital age. The study analyses the leadership elements needed and determines the impact of digital leadership on sustainable performance. The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) is to identify the relationship between digital leadership concepts and leadership development by proposing digital leadership for management development to ensure sustainable performance in an organisation. Design/methodology/approach: ROSES (RepOrting Standards for Systematics Evidence Syntheses) was used as the publication standard for this systematic literature review, which incorporated a variety of research approaches. For this study's article selection, one of the most important scientific databases, Scopus, was used. Only articles published between 2001 and 2021 were reviewed. The focus of the article was on digital leadership and performance. Findings: This review identified five main themes: leadership styles, measurements of leadership, antecedents to good leadership, outcomes of good leadership and gaps in current research areas. An additional ten sub-themes were derived from the five primary topics. Originality/value: This paper systematically reviewed two decades of literature related to digital leadership and its impact on sustainable performance. The findings allow leaders to better understand the leadership trend and develop appropriate leadership practices to overcome future challenges for sustainable performance. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital leadership;

Along the years, the increasing demand for these services has led to long queue problems in the clinic. As a result, the clinic becomes congested during peak hours, leaving both patients and healthcare staffs dissatisfied. Apart from Sejahtera Centre, long queue issue has been a common problem in many government outpatient departments across Malaysia. Therefore, this paper proposes a low-cost, user-friendly clinic management system that consists of a web application for clinic staff and a hybrid mobile application for patients. Real-time queue monitoring and queue forecasting using Time-Series Extrapolation is incorporated to help patients avoid peak hours and empower better clinic workforce management in handling different patient flow peaks. The web-based appointment approach allows patients to conveniently reschedule their appointments online and receive appointment reminders via the mobile application. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system, a prototype is developed and evaluated based on several interviews. The prototype serves as a basic working model that outlines the feasibility of the proposed concepts to improve queue issues in other clinics across Malaysia. © 2019 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).","Appointment system; Healthcare; Queue forecasts","","","","","","School of Computer Sciences; Sejahtera Centre of University of Science, Malaysia","The authors wish to acknowledge the School of Computer Sciences (SoCS) and Sejahtera Centre of University of Science, Malaysia for their support in providing us various resources in developing the proposed system.

The agile methodology has gained lots of popularity in the last 15 years and become very traditional and acceptable widely among software engineers; nevertheless, the use of agile methods has extended to cover other areas of software engineering field including Requirement Engineering (RE) that fit the need of web engineering. The pace of the current web's software development is fast and dynamic such that the changes of the requirements during software development and after turning to production phase are possible and recurrent. Therefore, agile software engineering conceptuality has evolved as an adequate approach to overcome changes in the web's software's requirements; due to frequent changes in requirements, web engineers call for help of agile software engineering methods, which strive to truly manage changes in requirements rather than preventing these changes. This paper provides a review on the available agile methodologies that used to assess requirement change management in web engineering. © 2023 IEEE.","Agile Methodologies; Engineering; Requirement Change Management; Software Engineering","Application programs; Software design; Agile Methodologies; Agile methods; Agile software engineering; Change in requirements; Engineering fields; Requirement change managements; Web based development; Web engineering; Web software; Web-based system; Websites","","","","","","","Murugesan S., Deshpande Y., Web Engineering: Managing Diversity and Complexity Of Web Application Development, Ser.

The authors were unable to find a comprehensive study on crime hotspot detection and prediction while conducting this SLR. Therefore, to the best of author's knowledge, this study is the premier attempt to critically analyze the existing literature along with presenting potential challenges faced by current crime hotspot detection and prediction systems. The SLR is conducted by thoroughly consulting top five scientific databases (such as IEEE, Science Direct, Springer, Scopus, and ACM), and synthesized 49 different studies on crime hotspot detection and prediction after critical review. This study unfolds the following major aspects: 1) the impact of data mining and machine learning approaches, especially clustering techniques in crime hotspot detection; 2) the utility of time series analysis techniques and deep learning techniques in crime trend prediction; 3) the inclusion of spatial and temporal information in crime datasets making the crime prediction systems more accurate and reliable; 4) the potential challenges faced by the state-of-the-art techniques and the future research directions. Moreover, the SLR aims to provide a core foundation for the research on spatiooral crime prediction applications while highlighting several challenges related to the accuracy of crime hotspot detection and prediction applications. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

However, the adoption of this innovation is slowed by security challenge. Apparently, the use of only TLS (transport layer security) security technique for SOSE systems is inappropriate because it provides only point-to-point security support to the communicating parties. While, an end-to-end security mechanism is necessary to effectively secure SOSE applications. Consequently, this paper provides SNSM framework, a solution to SOSE security challenge by integrating many technologies including OASIS's web service security standard, W3C's XML digital signature and XML encryption standards into SOAP envelope to ensure end-to-end security at the message level. In the implementation of the framework, proxy service, a virtual service hosted in the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) was used to enforce security services as a Quality of service (QOS) requirement. The results show that SNSM framework recorded 10 millisecond average response time above unsecured service, whereas, the TLS secured service has the largest average response time. © 2016 IEEE.","Security Challenge; SNSM Framework; SOAP message; SOSE","Application programs; Control systems; Cryptography; Network function virtualization; Quality of service; Response time (computer systems); Software design; System of systems; Web services; XML; End-to-end application; Enterprise service bus; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Security challenges; SNSM Framework; SOAP messages; Transport layer security; XML digital signatures; Network security","","","","","","","Ahmed M.M., Letchmunan S., A systematic literature review on challenges in service oriented software engineering, International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Applications, 9, 6, pp. 173-186, (2015); Schmelzer R., XML and Web Services, (2002); Muneera B., Ikram N., Niazi M., Requirements engineering challenges in service oriented software engineering: An exploratory online survey, International Journal for Software Engineering (IJSE), 6, 2, pp. 21-43, (2013); Ali Arsanjani L.-J.Z., Ellis M., Allam A., Channabasavaiah K., S3 Service-Oriented Reference Architecture, (2007); O'Neill M., Hallan-Baker P., Cann M.S., Shema M., Simon E., Watters P.A., White A., Web Services Security, (2003); SOA Reference Architecture., (2011); Michael M., Et al., SOA security-secure cross-organizational service composition, Proceedings of the Stuttgarter Softwaretechnik Forum, (2007); Czagan D., Non-repudiation and Digital Signature, (2014); Cryptography & Network Security., (2007); Paul K., Et al., Security as a new dimension in embedded system design, Proceedings of the 41st Annual Design Automation Conference., (2004); Stallings W., Cryptography Network Security Principles Practice, (2011); Gurpreet S., Supriya A., A study of encryption algorithms (rsa, des, 3des and aes) for information security, International Journal of Computer Applications, 67, 19, pp. 33-38, (2013); Agrawal M., Mishra P., A comparative survey on symmetric key encryption techniques, International Journal on Computer Science and Engineering (IJCSE), 4, 5, pp. 877-882, (2012); Uma S., Lakhani K., Mundra M., Implementing digital signature with rsa encryption algorithm to enhance the data security of cloud in cloud computing, Parallel Distributed and Grid Computing (PDGC) 2010 1st International Conference On., (2010); Retrieved from Advance Open Standards for the Information Society, (2015); Roshen W., SOA-Based Enterprise Integration, A Step-by-step Guide for Services-Based Application Integration, (2009); Deitel P.J., Deitel H.M., Java How to Program, (2007); Hondo M.E., Retrieved from Security Patterns Within A Service-Oriented Architecture, (2005)","M.M.
