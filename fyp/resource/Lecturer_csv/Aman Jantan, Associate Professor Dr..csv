In this study, we propose a novel solution for deconstructing the multiple behaviors of consumers in a specific period and performing customer segmentation in an application promotion system called multi-behavior RFM (MB-RFM) based on the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm. First, using the R, F, and M values, we analyzed the weight relationship between multiple behaviors of users and items using the superiority chart and entropy value methods. Each behavior ascribed to a customer was considered to be a part of MB-RFM model values, which were then used to classify customers using an improved SOM neural network. Subsequently, various promotion strategies were developed according to customer categories that can help application vendors in improving their application utilization and implementing targeted promotion strategies. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method in sparse datasets, two real-world datasets were used to perform experiments, whose results demonstrated that the classification performance of our method was significantly more accurate.  © 2013 IEEE.","Application promotion system; customer segmentation; multi-behavior RFM model; self-organizing map neural network","Classification (of information); Consumer behavior; Sales; Self organizing maps; Application promotion system; Customers segmentations; Model-based OPC; Monetary value; Multi-behavior recency, frequency, and monetary value model; Neural networks algorithms; Promotion strategies; Promotion systems; Self-organizing map neural network; Value model; Conformal mapping","","","","","","","Report on E-commerce in China, (2020); Fader P.S., Hardie B.G.S., Lee K.L., RFM and CLV: Using isovalue curves for customer base analysis, J.

Nowadays, the cyber crime strategies have increasingly become more complicated in the digital world. This paper proposes a new model to estimate the similar attack strategy with others. The model uses a cosine similarity method, and it depends on the attack of intention analysis as an effected factor to identify the similar attack strategy. The probability values of accuracy detection of attack intention conducted from the Attack Intention Analysis (AIA) algorithm. The experiments were performed on a virtual cyber crime case to evaluate the proposed model. From the similarity of attack strategy observation, the proposed model can reduce the time and processing cost of a decision-making at investigation phase. In addition, the attack intention maximizes the accuracy of similar attack strategy estimation. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","attack analysis; attack strategy; cyber crimes; intention similarity; network forensics","Crime; Estimation; Factor analysis; Network security; Attack analysis; Attack strategies; Cyber-crimes; intention similarity; Network forensics; Computer crime","","","","","","","2011 CyberSecurity Watch Survey, (2011); Pilli E.S., Joshi R.C., Niyogi R., Network forensic frameworks: Survey and research challenges, Digital Investigation, 7, 1-2, pp. 14-27, (2010); Palmer G., A Road Map for Digital Forensic Research, DFRWS 2001, F.D.F.R.

The trail of digital information on social media, if explored correctly, can offer remarkable support in criminal investigations. However, exploring social media for potential evidence and presenting these proofs in court is not a straightforward task. Social media evidence must be collected by a legally and scientifically appropriate forensic process and also coincide with the privacy rights of individuals. Following the legal process is a challenging task for legal practitioners and investigators due to the highly dynamic and heterogeneous nature of social media. Forensic investigators can conduct effective investigations and collect legally sound evidence efficiently if they are provided with sophisticated tools to manage the diversity and size of social media content. This article explains the current state of evidence acquisition, admissibility, and jurisdiction in social media forensics. It also describes the immediate challenges for the collection, analysis, presentation, and validation of social media evidence in legal proceedings. Furthermore, the research gaps in the domain and few research objectives with potential research directions are presented. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Admissibility; Forensic preservation; Research Goals; Social Media as Evidence; Social Media forensic acquisition","Social networking (online); Admissibility; Criminal investigation; Evidence acquisition; Evidence collection; Forensic acquisition; Potential researches; Research goals; Social media; Digital forensics","","","","","","","Abel F., Herder E., Houben G.J., Henze N., Krause D., Cross-system user modeling and personalization on the Social Web, User Model.

Law enforcement agencies and legal practitioners frequently utilize social networks to quickly access the information related to the participants of any illicit incident. However, the forensic process needs collection and analysis of the information which is immense, heterogeneous, and spread across multiple social networks. This process is technically intricate due to heterogeneous and unstructured online social networks (OSNs). Hence, creating cognitive challenges and massive workloads for the investigators. Therefore, it is imperative to develop automated and reliable solutions to assist investigators. Capturing the forensic information in the structured form is crucial for automation, sharing, and interoperability. This paper introduces the design of a multi-layer framework; from collection to evidence analysis. The central component of this framework is a hybrid ontology approach that involves multiple ontologies to manage the unstructured data and integrate various social media data collections. This approach aims to find the evidence by automated methods that are trustworthy and therefore admissible in a court of law. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Hybrid Ontology model; Online social network forensics; Social network analysis; Social network forensic automation","Automation; Information management; Ontology; Semantics; Social networking (online); Forensic acquisition; Forensic information; Law-enforcement agencies; Online social networks (OSNs); Ontology model; Semantic framework; Social media datum; Social media networks; Digital forensics","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This study is partially funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia RUI grant, Account No. [ 1001/PKOMP/8014017 ].

Thus, the proposed approach consists of two stages: (1) using a new feature selection technique called multi-objective ABC feature selection to reduce the number of features of network traffic data and (2) using a new classification technique called hybrid ABC-PSO optimized FFNN to classify the output data from the previous stage, determine an intruder packet, and detect known and unknown intruders. © 2016.","Feature Selection; Intrusion Detection System; Multi-Objective Optimization; Swarm Intelligent; Wrapper Approach","","","","","","","","Horng S.J., Su M.Y., Chen Y.H., Kao T.W., Chen R.J., Lai J.L., Perkasa C.D., A novel intrusion detection system based on hierarchical clustering and support vector machines, Expert systems with Applications, 38, 1, pp. 306-313, (2011); Anderson J.P., Computer security threat monitoring and surveillance, 17, (1980); Subbulakshmi T., Ramamoorthi A., Shalinie S.M., Feature Selection and Classification of Intrusions Using Genetic Algorithm and Neural Networks, In Recent Trends in Networks and Communications, pp. 223-234, (2010); Elngar A.A., Dowlat A., Ghaleb F.F., A Fast Accurate Network Intrusion Detection System, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 10, 9, (2012); Wu S.X., Banzhaf W., The use of computational intelligence in intrusion detection systems: A review, Applied Soft Computing, 10, 1, pp. 1-35, (2010); Luo B., Xia J., A novel intrusion detection system based on feature generation with visualization strategy, Expert Systems with Applications, 41, 9, pp. 4139-4147, (2014); Xue B., Zhang M., Browne W.N., Particle swarm optimization for feature selection in classification: A multi-objective approach, Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on, 43, 6, pp. 1656-1671, (2013); Idowu R.K., Maroosi A., Muniyandi R.C., Othman Z.A., An Application of Membrane Computing to Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System, Procedia Technology, 11, pp. 585-592, (2013); Akbari R., Hedayatzadeh R., Ziarati K., Hassanizadeh B., A multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 2, pp. 39-52, (2012); Karaboga D., An idea based on honey bee swarm for numerical optimization, 200, (2005); Karaboga D., Basturk B., A powerful and efficient algorithm for numerical function optimization: artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, Journal of global optimization, 39, 3, pp. 459-471, (2007); Beheshti Z., Mariyam Hj Shamsuddin S., A review of population-based meta-heuristic algorithms, Int.

This paper introduces TLSMalDetect, a TLS-based malware detection approach that integrates periodicity-independent entropy-based flow set (EFS) features generated by a flow feature transformation technique to solve flow feature utilization issues in related research. The effectiveness of EFS features was evaluated in two ways: (1) by comparing them to the corresponding outlier percentage and flow features using four feature importance methods, and (2) by analyzing classification performance with and without EFS features. Moreover, new Transmission Control Protocol features not explored in the literature were incorporated into TLSMalDetect, and their contribution was assessed. This study's results proved that EFS features of the number of packets sent and received were superior to the related outlier percentage and flow features and could remarkably increase the performance up to ~42 percent in the case of Support Vector Machine accuracy. Furthermore, using the basic features, TLSMalDetect achieved the highest accuracy of 93.69 percent by Naïve Bayes (NB) among the ML algorithms applied. From a comparison view, TLSMalDetect's Random Forest precision of 98.99 percent and NB recall of 92.91 percent exceeded the best relevant findings of previous studies. These comparative results demonstrated TLSMalDetect's ability to detect more malware flows out of total malicious flows than existing works. It could also generate more actual alerts from overall alerts than earlier research. © 2022.

Initially, each neuron is mapped to its best matching unit in the self organizing map and then updated by the fuzzy cognitive map framework. This updating is achieved through the weights of the neighboring neurons. Based on the domain knowledge of network data (network packets) the SOM/FCM combination presents quantitative and qualitative matching correspondences which in turn reduce the number of suspicious neurons i.e. reduce the number of false alerts.

Our objective is upstream of these works: we are concerned with privacy diagnosis. In this paper, we start by investigating the issue of k-anonymity. We propose algorithms to explore various questions about k-anonymity of data. Such questions are, for instance, ""is my data sufficiently anonymous?"", ""which information, if available from an outside source, threatens the anonymity of my data?"" In this paper we focus on anonymity and, in particular, k-anonymity. The algorithms that we propose leverage two properties of k-anonymity that we express in the form of two lemmas. The first lemma is a monotonicity property that enables us to adapt the a-priori algorithm for k-anonymity. The second lemma is a determinism property that enables us to devise an efficient algorithm for δ-suppression. We illustrate and empirically analyze the performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2008 IEEE.","","Chemical shift; Computer science; Computers; Data structures; Electric currents; Magnetic anisotropy; Anonymization; Efficient algorithms; Monotonicity properties; Algorithms","","","","","","","Sweeney L., k-Anonymity: A Model for Protecting Privacy, International Journal on Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-based Systems, 10, pp. 557-570, (2002); Machanavajjhala A., Kifer D., Gehrke J., Venkitasubramaniam M., 1-Diversity: Privacy beyond k-Anonymity, ICDE'06, (2006); Li N., Li T., Venkatasubramanian S., t-Closeness: Privacy Beyond k-Anonymity and l-Diversity, ICDE'07, pp. 106-115, (2007); Agrawal R., Imielinski T., Swami A., Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases, SIGMOD, (1993); Samarati P., Sweeney L., Protecting Privacy when Disclosing Information: K-Anonymity and its Enforcement through Generalization and Suppression, (1998); Byun J.-W., Kamra A., Bertino E., Li N., Efficient k-Anonymity Using Clustering Technique, (2006); Aggarwal C.C., On k-Anonymity and the Curse of Dimensionality, VLDB'05, pp. 901-909, (2005); Sweeney L., Achieving k-Anonymity Privacy Protection Using Generalizing and Suppression, International Journal on Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-based Systems, 10, pp. 571-588, (2002); Aggarwal G., Feder T., Kenthapadi K., Khuller S., Panigrahy R., Thomas D., Zhu A., Achieving Anonymity via Clustering, PODS'06, (2006); Iyengar V., Transforming Data to Satisfy Privacy Constraints, SIGKDD, pp. 279-288, (2002); Xu J., Wang W., Pei J., Wang X., Shi B., Fu A.W.-C., Utility-based Anonymization Using Local Recoding, KDD '06, (2006); Fung B.C.M., Wang K., Yu P.S., Top-down Specialization for Information and Privacy Preservation, ICDE, pp. 205-216, (2005); LeFevre K., DeWitt D.J., Ramakrishnan R., Incognito: Efficient Full-domain k-Anonymity, SIGMOD, pp. 49-60, (2005); LeFevre K., DeWitt D.J., Ramakrishnan R., Mondrian Multidimensional k-Anonymity, ICDE, (2006); Xiao X., Tao Y., Anatomy: Simple and Effective Privacy Preservation, VLDB'06, pp. 139-150, (2006); Motwani R., Xu Y., Efficient Algorithms for Masking and Finding Quasi-Identifiers, VLDB '07, (2007); Samarati P., Protecting Respondents' Identities in Microdata Release, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 13, pp. 1010-1027, (2001); Wang K., Fung B.C.M., Anonymizing Sequential Releases, KDD'06, pp. 414-423, (2006); Blake C., Merz C., UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases, (1998); Bayardo R.J., Agrawal R., Data Privacy through Optimal k-Anonymization, ICDE'05, (2005)","M.

This is because bytes encode utf8 (or ASCII) characters. Consequently, an adversary that intercepts a ciphertext and tries to decrypt the message by brute-forcing with an incorrect key can filter out some of the combinations of the decrypted message by observing that some of the sequences are a combination of characters which are distributed non-uniformly and form no plausible meaning. Honey encryption (HE) scheme was proposed to curtail this vulnerability of conventional encryption by producing ciphertexts yielding valid-looking, uniformly distributed but fake plaintexts upon decryption with incorrect keys. However, the scheme works for only passwords and PINS. Its adaptation to support encoding natural language messages (e-mails, human-generated documents) has remained an open problem. Existing proposals to extend the scheme to support encoding natural language messages reveals fragments of the plaintext in the ciphertext, hence, its susceptibility to chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA). In this paper, we modify the HE schemes to support the encoding of natural language messages using Natural Language Processing techniques. Our main contribution was creating a structure that allowed a message to be encoded entirely in binary. As a result of this strategy, most binary string produces syntactically correct messages which will be generated to deceive an attacker who attempts to decrypt a ciphertext using incorrect keys. We evaluate the security of our proposed scheme. Copyright © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Cloud computing still faces lots of challenges, topmost is security and privacy of its data. Among of the data security challenges the cloud faces are data (breach, loss, retention, segregation and remanence etc.). But remanence which is the residue of data that still remains in storage after deletion, is a crucial challenge most especially in the cloud and has received minimal attention from the users and CSP (cloud service providers). Data breach and disclosure by unauthorized persons can occur in different forms among of which is improper disposal of data when it is no longer needed. We will be reviewing various work related to data remanence, its challenges, and its prospects.

However, its origins are difficult to detect and trace given similarities between abusive and normal traffic. So far, there is no capable and scalable mechanism to deal with bandwidth abuse. This paper proposes a distributed edge-to-edge model for monitoring service level agreement (SLA) violations and tracing abusive traffic to its origins. The mechanism of policing misbehaving user traffic at a single random early detection (RED) gateway is used in the distributed monitoring of SLA violations, including violations carried out through several gateways. Each RED gateway reports misbehaving users who have been sent notifications of traffic policing to an SLA monitoring unit. Misbehaving users are considered suspicious users and their consumed bandwidth shares are aggregated at every gateway to be compared with SLA-specified ratios. Bandwidth is abused when SLA-specified ratios are exceeded. By reporting bandwidth abuse, illegitimate users can be isolated from legitimate ones and source hosts of abusive traffic may be traced. Approximate simulation results show that the proposed model can detect any SLA violation and identify abusive users. In addition, the proposed model can trace user violations back to their source machines in real time. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Distributed monitoring; Malicious users; RED gateways; Service level agreement; Source machine traceback","Congestion control (communication); Distributed monitoring; Malicious users; RED gateways; Service Level Agreements; Traceback; Bandwidth","","","","","School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia; University of Southern Maine, USM","Acknowledgments This research is sponsored by RU Grant No. 1001/PKOMP/817048, School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Penang, Malaysia.","Suresh M., Anitha R., Wyld D.C., Wozniak M., Chaki N., Meghanathan N., Nagamalai D., Evaluating Machine Learning Algorithms for Detecting DDoS Attacks Advances in Network Security and Applications, pp. 441-452, (2011); Jing L., Yang X., Kaveh G., Hongmei D., Jingyuan Z., Botnet: Classification, attacks, detection, tracing, and preventive measures, Proceedings of the 2009 Fourth International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control: IEEE Computer Society, (2009); Zhou C.V., Leckie C., Karunasekera S., A survey of coordinated attacks and collaborative intrusion detection, Comput.

There have been several efforts for improving it from various points of view. One example is the improvement of the classification of packets on the network, which is imperative in detecting abnormal traffic and hence any potential intrusion. Thus, this study proposes a new approach for intrusion detection that is implemented using an enhanced Bat algorithm (EBat) for training an artificial neural network. The goal of the current study is to increase the accuracy of the classification for malicious and un-malicious network traffic. The proposed study herein includes a comparison with nine other metaheuristic algorithms (conventional and new algorithms) that are used to evaluate the new approach alongside the related works. Firstly, the EBat algorithm was developed and used to select suitable weights and biases. Next, the neural network was employed using the found optimal weights and biases to realize the intrusion detection approach. Four types of intrusion detection evaluation datasets were used to compare the proposed approach against the other algorithms. The findings revealed that the proposed method outperformed the other nine classification algorithms and it is unparalleled for the network intrusion detection. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Bat algorithm; Global optimization problem; Intrusion detection system; Multilayer perceptron; Mutation operator; Swarm intelligence","Computer crime; Computer networks; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Network security; Neural networks; Swarm intelligence; Bat algorithms; Classification algorithm; Global optimization problems; Intrusion detection approaches; Intrusion Detection Systems; Meta heuristic algorithm; Mutation operators; Network intrusion detection; Intrusion detection","","","","","APEX, (1002/CIPS/ATSG4001, 208/AIPS/415401); University of Southern Maine, USM; Universiti Sains Malaysia"," This research has been funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia under USM Fellowship [APEX (208/AIPS/415401) and (1002/CIPS/ATSG4001)].

Nonetheless, the proficiency of the IDS framework depends essentially on extracted features from network traffic and an effective classifier of the traffic into abnormal or normal traffic. The prime impetus of this study is to increase the performance of the IDS on networks by building a two-phase framework to reinforce and subsequently enhance detection rate and diminish the rate of false alarm. The initial stage utilizes the developed algorithm of a proficient wrapper-approach-based feature selection which is created on a multi-objective BAT algorithm (MOBBAT). The subsequent stage utilizes the features obtained from the initial stage to categorize the traffic based on the newly upgraded BAT algorithm (EBAT) for training multilayer perceptron (EBATMLP), to improve the IDS performance. The resulting methodology is known as the (MOB-EBATMLP). The efficiency of our proposition has been assessed by utilizing the mainstream benchmarked datasets: NLS-KDD, ISCX2012, UNSW-NB15, KDD CUP 1999, and CICIDS2017 which are established as standard datasets for evaluating IDS. The outcome of our experimental analysis demonstrates a noteworthy advancement in network IDS above other techniques.  © 2013 IEEE.","bat algorithm (BAT); feature selection (FS); Intrusion detection system (IDS); metaheuristic algorithm (MA); multi-objective optimization (MOO); multilayer perceptron (MLP)","Computer crime; Feature Selection; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Multiobjective optimization; Network security; Bat algorithm (BAT); Bat algorithms; Classification algorithm; Feature selection; Features extraction; Features selection; Intrusion detection system; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Metaheuristic; Metaheuristic algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Multi-objectives optimization; Multilayer perceptron; Multilayers perceptrons; Intrusion detection","","","","","","","Tchernykh A., Schwiegelsohn U., Talbi E.-G., Babenko M., Towards understanding uncertainty in cloud computing with risks of condentiality, integrity, and availability, J.

Two common techniques that can be used to analyze malware are static analysis and dynamic analysis. Nowadays, many malware writers try to avoid security checking by implement techniques such as anti-reverse engineering, packing and encryption. It was make static analysis difficult to be implemented. In this paper, we propose a new framework to analyze malware by using dynamic approach. This framework will define malware behavior through run time analysis and resource monitoring. The contribution of this study is the new framework for defining malware behavior based on operation and target operation of the malware. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","behavior analysis; dynamic analysis; malware; resource monitoring; run time analysis; secure environment","Computer crime; Dynamic analysis; Network security; Reverse engineering; Software engineering; Behavior analysis; Malwares; Resource monitoring; Run-time analysis; secure environment; Static analysis","","","","","","","Aycock J., Computer Viruses and Malware, (2006); Christodorescu M., Jha S., Seshia S.A., Song D., Bryant R.E., Semantics-Aware Malware Detection, IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 32-46, (2005); Jian L., Ning Z., Ming X., YongQing S., JiouChuan L., Malware Behavior Extracting via Maximal Patterns, 1st International Conference on Information Science and Engineering (ICISE), pp. 1759-1764, (2009); Idika N., Mathur A., A Survey of Malware Detection Techniques, (2007); McAfee Threats Report: Third Quarter 2010.

The proposed algorithm is based on the bat algorithm (BA), which is inspired by the micro-bat echolocation phenomenon, and addresses the problems of local-optima trapping and low precision using an adjusted mutation operator from the harmony search (HS) algorithm. The proposed Hybrid Bat Harmony (HBH) algorithm attempts to balance the good exploitation process of BA with a fast exploration feature inspired by HS. The design of HBH is introduced, and its performance is evaluated against 14 of the standard benchmark functions and compared to that of the standard BA and HS algorithms and to another recent hybrid algorithm (HS/BA). The obtained results show that the new HBH method is indeed a promising addition to the arsenal of metaheuristic algorithms and can outperform the original BA and HS algorithms. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Bat algorithm; Global optimization problem; Harmony search algorithm; Pitch adjustment operator; Swarm intelligence","Benchmarking; Global optimization; Benchmark functions; Global optimization problems; Hybrid algorithms; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic approach; Mutation operators; Numerical optimizations; Pitch adjustments; Genetic algorithms","","","","","APEX, (203/PKOMP/6711426, 308/AIPS/ 415401); Universiti Sains Malaysia","Acknowledgments This research was funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia, APEX (308/AIPS/ 415401) and was also supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) for “Content Based Analysis Framework for Better Email Forensic and Cyber Investigation” [203/PKOMP/6711426].","Sorensen K, Glover FW, Metaheuristics, Encyclopedia of operations research and management science, pp. 960-970, (2013); Eberhart RC, Kennedy J, A new optimizer using particle swarm theory, Proceedings of the sixth international symposium on micro machine and human science, (1995); Dorigo M, Birattari M, Stutzle T, Ant colony optimization, IEEE Comput Intell Mag, 1, 4, pp. 28-39, (2006); Dorigo M, Maniezzo V, Colorni A, Ant system: optimization by a colony of cooperating agents, IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Part B Cybern, 26, 1, pp. 29-41, (1996); Karaboga D, An idea based on honey bee swarm for numerical optimization, (2005); Karaboga D, Basturk B, A powerful and efficient algorithm for numerical function optimization: artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, JGlob Optim, 39, 3, pp. 459-471, (2007); Yang XS, Nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, (2010); Yang XS, Deb S, Cuckoo search via Lévy flights, Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing, 2009.

Attackers often target the authentication stage where a customer may be entering his login information on the ATM and thus use direct observation techniques by looking over the customer's shoulder to steal his passwords. Existing authentication mechanism employs the traditional password-based authentication system which fails to curb these attacks. This paper addresses this problem using the FingerEye. The FingerEye is a robust system integrated with iris-scan authentication. A customer’s profile is created at registration where the pattern in his iris is analyzed and converted into binary codes. The binary codes are then stored in the bank database and are required for verification prior to any transaction. We leverage on the iris because every user has unique eyes which do not change until death and even a blind person with iris can be authenticated too. We implemented and tested the proposed system using CIMB bank, Malaysia as case study. The FingerEye is integrated with the current infrastructure employed by the bank and as such, no extra cost was incurred. Our result demonstrates that ATM attacks become impractical. Moreover, transactions were executed faster from 6.5 seconds to 1.4 seconds.. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

HE offers security beyond the brute-force bound by yielding plausible-looking but fake plaintext upon decryption with an incorrect key. Recent developments have seen the application of HE in the security of specific real-world systems, such as passwords and credit cards. However, applying the HE scheme to address other economic problems remains a daunting task as it requires modifying the HE algorithm to fit into the problem-in-view. For instance, applying the scheme for robust transmission of chat-messages upon decryption with an incorrect key will demand to generate contextually correct, valid-looking but fake chat-message which is indistinguishable from a human-generated message. This paper enhances the HE scheme by leveraging natural language processing techniques to build semantically plausible but fake chat-messages which will be served to the adversary during his attacks. Findings from evaluations reveal that the novel system is resilient to eavesdropping as an adversary is unable to distinguish decoy messages from the plaintext upon decryption with an incorrect key. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Brute-force; Chatting; Decoys; Eavesdropping; Honey encryption; Instant messaging","Food products; Message passing; Natural language processing systems; Security systems; Brute force; Chatting; Decoys; Eavesdropping; Instant messaging; Cryptography","","","","","University of Southern Maine, USM, (1001/PKCOMP/8014017)","Funding was provided by USM RUI Grant (Grant No. 1001/PKCOMP/8014017).

The modeling method is an empirical formula for measuring individual actor's level of involvement in terrorism crime. Terrorists are gaining ground virtually in the most nation of the world. This has become a global challenge as the attacks have recorded millions of deaths of innocent people, incapacitated people, and destroyed properties. In addition, the attacks rendered most communities and countries economically dormant and create a complex crisis among the people. In the research approach, the mathematical model developed is used to detect person's involvement in terrorism. Furthermore, the mathematical model result can be used to predict or calculate the outcome of the dependent parameter from the varying independents. In conclusion, the research objectives were achieved as there was a record of 0.26495 or 26.495% prediction on the overall test which determined the levels of optimization and improvement. Thus, we recommend that people's profiling analysis has a significant contribution to terrorist detecting if integrated into the system as a solution to terrorist attacks. © 2018 Newswood Limited.

Though, their security is often challenged by adversaries such as Botnet. Botnet leverages the encrypted channel to launch attacks and amplify the impact of attacks. The numbers of Botnet attacks over an encrypted channel are increasing and continue to cause a great loss of money. This study proposes an encrypted Botnet detection technique based on packet header analysis. This technique does not require deep packet inspection and intense traffic analysis. However, the proposed technique requires the analysis of the features taken from the packet header, which are essential for detection. The study endeavors to show that features selected can significantly affect the classification of encrypted Botnet. Therefore, in this paper, the researchers focus on the effects of feature selection on the classification of encrypted Botnet. The researchers use different classification mode (full training and 10-fold cross-validation) mainly by using seven features (7-features) and three features (3-features). Seven features are the number of features extracted from the packet header, and after the feature selection, only three features out of the seven features have weight (value). Therefore, the three features are the most significant features from the seven features that have been extracted. Generally, the result shows that classification with three most significant features provides higher true positive compared to the 7-features classification. Different machine learning algorithms have been used for the classification. Relatively, the results show that the True Positives are higher for 3-features classification than 7-features classification. © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Classification; Encrypted botnet; Feature selection; Machine learning; Packet header analysis","Botnet; Cryptography; Feature extraction; Information dissemination; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; 10-fold cross-validation; Botnet detections; Deep packet inspection; Packet header; Traffic analysis; True positive; Classification (of information)","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/ PKOMP/ 8014017)","This research is supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia through Research University (RUI) Grant, titled “Enhancing Botnet Detection Efficiency and Accuracy using Machine Learning Techniques” (Account Number 1001/ PKOMP/ 8014017).

The proposed hybrid algorithm uses the butterfly adjusting operator in monarch butterfly optimization (MBO) algorithm as a mutation operator to replace the employee phase of the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. The novel hybrid ABC/MBO (HAM) algorithm addresses the issues of trapping in local optimal solutions, slow convergence, and low precision by improving the balance between the characteristics of exploration and exploitation. The proposed HAM algorithm is validated on eight benchmark functions and is compared with ABC and MBO algorithms. The experimental results show that the HAM algorithm is clearly superior to both the standard ABC and MBO algorithms. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Artificial bee colony algorithm; Computation Intelligence; Global Optimization problem; Monarch butterfly optimization algorithm; Swarm intelligence","Global optimization; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Benchmark functions; Exploration and exploitation; Global optimization problems; Local optimal solution; Meta heuristic algorithm; Mutation operators; Genetic algorithms","","","","","APEX, (203/PKOMP/6711426, 308/AIPS/ 415401); Apex Foundation; Universiti Sains Malaysia","Funding text 1: This work has been funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia, APEX (308/AIPS/ 415401), and also supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) 203/PKOMP/6711426].; Funding text 2: Acknowledgments This work has been funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia, APEX (308/AIPS/ 415401), and also supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) 203/PKOMP/6711426].","Sorensen K, Glover FW, Metaheuristics, Encyclopedia of operations research and management science, pp. 960-970, (2013); Eberhart RC, Kennedy J, A new optimizer using particle swarm theory, Proceedings of the sixth international symposium on micro machine and human science, (1995); Dorigo M, Birattari M, Stutzle T, Ant colony optimization, IEEE Comput Intell Mag, 1, 4, pp. 28-39, (2006); Dorigo M, Maniezzo V, Colorni A, Ant system: optimization by a colony of cooperating agents, IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern B Cybern, 26, 1, pp. 29-41, (1996); Karaboga D, An idea based on honey bee swarm for numerical optimization, (2005); Karaboga D, Basturk B, A powerful and efficient algorithm for numerical function optimization: artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, J Glob Optim, 39, 3, pp. 459-471, (2007); Yang X-S, Nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, (2010); Yang X-S, Deb S, Cuckoo search via Lévy flights, Nature & biologically inspired computing, 2009.

Experts popularly describe ransomware as scareware that makes data and resources on a victims' computers inaccessible and forces the victims to pay a ransom with bitcoins or through other means by frightening and intimidating them. Ransomware these days needs no introduction. The perpetrators behind ransomware have done more than enough damage to critical infrastructures and collected billions of dollars from victims across the world and are still collecting. As such, this research aims at uncovering the underlying mysteries behind the sudden growth and popularity of ransomware through the in-depth study of literature and efforts made by experts globally in understanding ransomware and how to fight and stop it. Moreover, the research seeks to bring together the collective professionals' views and recommendations on how to set up strategic defense in-depth for fighting against ransomware. © 2021, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Abiodun O.I., Jantan A., Omolara A.E., Mahinderjit M.M., Abubakar Z.L., Umar A.M., Big Data: An Approach for Detecting Terrorist Activities with People ' s Profiling, Proceedings of the International MultiConference of Engineers and Computer Scientists, 1, (2018); A new strain of ransomware nicknamed ""Bad Rabbit"" asks to update Adobe Flash Player, (2017); Ambre A., Shekokar N., Insider Threat Detection Using Log Analysis and Event Correlation, Procedia Computer Science, 45, pp. 436-445, (2015); Ashford W., Ransomware growing rapidly, warns Intel's McAfee Labs, (2015); Bambenek J., Ransomware in the Age of Wannacry: What Fintech Needs to Know, (2017); Understanding Ransomware, (2017); Beek C., Furtak A., Analysis of a targeted and manual ransomware campaign, International Security; Brodsky J., Detection of Ransomware and Prevention Strategies, (2017); Brunau C., Common Types of Ransomware, (2017); Cabaj K., Gregorczyk M., Mazurczyk W., Software-defined networking-based crypto ransomware detection using HTTP traffic characteristics, Computers & Electrical Engineering, pp. 1-16, (2017); Chickowski E., Indicators Of Compromise, Dark Reading News, (2013); Indicators of Compromise and Where to Find Them, Cisco Blogs, (2017); Collins K., The latest ransomware presents itself as an Adobe Flash Player download, (2017); To Pay or Not to Pay: How to Survive a Ransomware Attack, Common Wealth Financial Network, (2017); How Ransomware Works, (2017); Crowe J., Ransomware by the Numbers: Must-Know Ransomware Statistics 2016, (2016); Crowe J., Must-Know Ransomware Statistics, (2017); Ransomware: What you need to know, (2017); 5 Methods For Detecting Ransomware Activity, (2016); Davis J., Ransomware: See the 14 hospitals attacked so far in 2016, Healthcare IT News, (2016); Dawes S., WannaCry Ransomware: How to Detect the Vulnerability and Exploits, (2017); Downs J., Cook D., Wright J., Kent J., Protecting Data in the Age of Ransomware, (2017); Downs J., Taylor A., Whiting I., Fighting Ransomware & Responding if the Worst Happens, (2017); Crypto-ransomware; Criminals Continue To Defraud And Extort Funds From Victims Using Cryptowall Ransomware Schemes, (2015); Ransomware Victims Urged To Report Infections to Federal Law Enforcement, (2016); Incidents of Ransomware on the Rise, Federal Bureau of Investigation, (2016); Fimin M., Are employees part of the ransomware problem?, Computer Fraud & Security, 8, pp. 15-17, (2017); Threat Landscape Report, (2017); Fruhlinger J., What is ransomware?

Improvements have been proposed from various perspectives. One such proposal is improving the classification of packets in a network to determine whether the classified packets contain harmful packages. In this study, we present a new approach for intrusion detection using a hybrid of the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to develop an artificial neural network with increased precision in classifying malicious from harmless traffic in a network. Our proposed algorithm is compared with four other algorithms employed in WEKA tool, namely, radial basis function, voted perceptron, logistic regression, and multilayer perceptron. The system is first prepared, and then suitable biases and weights, for the feed-forward neural network are selected using the hybrid ABC–PSO algorithm. Then, the network is retrained using the prepared information, which has been generated from the ideal weights and biases, to establish the intrusion-detection model. The KDD Cup 1999 data set is used as the information set in comparing our proposed algorithm with the other algorithms. The experiment shows that the proposed method outperforms the four classification algorithms and is suitable for network intrusion detection. © 2018 Pakistan Journal of Statistics.","Artificial bee colony algorithm; Data mining; Feed-forward neural network; Intrusion detection system; Particle swarm optimization","","","","","","University of Southern Maine, USM; Apex Foundation; Institute of Postgraduate Studies, Universiti Sains Malaysia, IPS; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8630022, 203/PKOMP/6711426, 308/AIPS/415401)","This research experiment has been funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia under the Research University Cluster Grant Scheme (RUC) for “Reconstruction of the Neural Micro circuitry or Reward-Controlled Learning in the Rat Hippocampus” [1001/PKOMP/8630022].

However, the threat of intruders on Internet services is prevalent. This paper proposes a distributed edge-to-edge complementary approach for intrusion detection in a DiffServ/MPLS domain. The QoS metrics are inspected at the edges routers to determine anomalous behavior in the network traffic. Consumed ratios of one-way delay variation (OWDV) and packet loss are computed to monitor service level agreement (SLA) violations. The bandwidth ratio is measured to differentiate abnormal from normal traffic as well as to detect multiple intrusions launched simultaneously. We employed SLA as a comparison scale to infer the deviation between the users consumed ratios and the predefined ratios in the SLA. Service violation occurs and intrusion may be launched when the predefined ratios are exceeded. The complementary services of DiffServ and MPLS techniques guarantee accurate measurements, whereas the complementary measurements of active and passive techniques immunize network performance against scalability limitation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach is capable of monitoring SLA violations and can filter out traffic of intruders who breach SLA without disturbing the normal traffic of legitimate users. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, decrypting network data before it reaches the signature-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to identify TLS-based malware is impractical since it adds infrastructure complexity and compromises user privacy. As a result, various studies have moved to investigate anomaly-based detection without decryption using different TLS features and techniques such as Machine Learning (ML).

Any potential evidences that are not accurate, complete, reliable and verifiable will certainly affect the decision among the jury and judges. In this paper, we classify the potential evidences that will be stored in the network storage based on their contents, characteristics and functions. We also propose a Secure Storage Model, which implements components that preserve evidences using Cryptographic Hashing and Logging Report. As a result, we present the flow of our storage mechanisms and show the importance of hashing for forensics work to secure collected network evidences. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","cryptographic hash; network digital evidence;

This issue has been addressed in numerous works using various approaches, of which the most popular one is to consider intrusions as anomalies with respect to the normal traffic in the network and classify network packets as either normal or abnormal. Improving the accuracy and efficiency of this classification is still an open problem to be solved. The study carried out in this article is based on a new approach for intrusion detection that is mainly implemented using the Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) and Monarch Butterfly optimization (MBO). This approach is implemented for preparing an artificial neural system (ANN) in order to increase the precision degree of classification for malicious and non-malicious traffic in systems. The suggestion taken into consideration was to place side-by-side nine other metaheuristic algorithms that are used to evaluate the proposed approach alongside the related works. In the beginning the system is prepared in such a way that it selects the suitable biases and weights utilizing a hybrid (ABC) and (MBO). Subsequently the artificial neural network is retrained by using the information gained from the ideal weights and biases which are obtained from the hybrid algorithm (HAM) to get the intrusion detection approach able to identify new attacks. Three types of intrusion detection evaluation datasets namely KDD Cup 99, ISCX 2012, and UNSW-NB15 were used to compare and evaluate the proposed technique against the other algorithms. The experiment clearly demonstrated that the proposed technique provided significant enhancement compared to the other nine classification algorithms, and that it is more efficient with regards to network intrusion detection. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","A multilayer perceptron (MLP); Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC); Intrusion detection system (IDS); Monarch Butterfly Optimization (MBO); Neural network training; Swarm Intelligence (SI)","Intrusion detection; Multilayer neural networks; Optimization; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Intrusion Detection Systems; Monarch Butterfly Optimization (MBO); Multi layer perceptron; Neural network training; Network security","","","","","APEX, (1002/CIPS/ATSG4001, 308/AIPS/415401); University of Southern Maine, USM; Apex Foundation, (1001/PKOMP/8014017); Universiti Sains Malaysia","Funding text 1:  This research has been funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia under USM Fellowship [APEX (308/AIPS/415401) (1002/CIPS/ATSG4001)].

Spam email has a significant negative impact on individuals and organizations alike, and is a serious waste of resources, time and effort. The task of filtering spam or junk e-mail is complex and very difficult to solve. Hence, learning-based filtering is considered an important method for detecting spam emails as the filtering technique requires training to epitomize the knowledge that can be used for detecting the spam. Thus, Artificial Neural Networks are being relied on to create a learning based filter. In this article, we particularly propose the Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) for identification of e-mail spam; the weights and biases of this network model are set to optimum using a new modified bat algorithm (EBAT). Experiments and results based mainly on two datasets (SPAMBASE and UK-2011 WEBSPAM datasets) show that the developed FFNN model trained by EBAT achieves high generalization performance compared to other optimization methods. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Artificial intelligent (AI); Bat algorithm (BAT); Feed-forward neural network (FFNN); Spam detection; Spam email; Swarm intelligence (SI)","","","","","","University of Southern Maine, USM; Apex Foundation; Institute of Postgraduate Studies, Universiti Sains Malaysia, IPS; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (308/AIPS/415401)","This research work was funded by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) for ""Content-Based Analysis Framework for Better Email Forensic and Cyber Investigation” [203/PKOMP/6711426].

For example, it is well known that Hopfield neural networks has limited stored patterns, local minimum problems, limited noise ratio, retrieve reverse value of pattern, and shifting and scaling problems. This research will propose multi-connect architecture (MCA) associative memory to improve the Hopfield neural network by modifying the net architecture, learning and convergence processes. This modification is to increase the performance of associative memory neural network by avoiding most of the Hopfield neural network limitations. In general, MCA is a single layer neural network uses auto-association tasks and working in two phases, that is learning and convergence phases. MCA was developed based on two principles. First, the smallest net size will be used rather than depending on the pattern size. Second, the learning process will be performed to the limited parts of the pattern only to avoid learning similar parts several times. The experiments performed show promising results when MCA shows high efficiency associative memory by avoiding most of the Hopfield net limitations. The results proved that the MCA net can learn and recognize unlimited patterns in varying size with acceptable percentage noise rate in comparison to the traditional Hopfield neural network. © 2012 TSI® Press.","Associative memory; Hopfield neural network; Neural network; Pattern recognition","","","","","","","","Abbiss J.B., Brames B.J., Fiddy M.A., Superresolution Algorithms For A Modified Hopfield Neural Network, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 39, 7, pp. 1516-1523, (1991); Dotsenko V.S., Yarunin N.D., Dorotheyev E.A., Statistical-Mechanics Of HopfieldLike Neural Networks With Modified Interactions, Journal of Physics a-Mathematical and.

Despite of the numerous protection systems, this threat is still lacking powerful remedy till day. This paper proposes a potent model for unwanted traffic detection in edge-to-edge QoS network domain. It is designed to detect service violations and bandwidth theft in the network. The ingress and egress edges at the ISP domain are used to feed Risk Management Unit (RMU) by information about delay, jitter and throughput.

The proposed approach consists of multi-agents deployed in distributed locations in the network to discriminate normal from malicious activates. These agents recognize a network attack using a mechanism contains Undesirable-Absent (UA) or Desirable-Present (DP) methods. The mechanism of recognizing the attacks is achieved through monitoring, detection and decision stages of protection. The UA method is used in the monitoring stage for matching the normal behaviour based on absence of attacks' signatures. The DP method is used in the detection stage for matching the malicious behaviours based on existence of attacks' signatures. The detected attack is reported for prevention in the decision stage. Neural network which trained by Back Propagation algorithm (BP) is used to learn the patterns of network attacks. The performance of the proposed honeybee system is evaluated using KDD'99 dataset. The obtained results show that the protection mechanism is deployable and capable to detect various types of attacks while maintaining a low rate of false alarms. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

On the one hand, we introduce a cognitively inspired hybridization metaheuristic that combines the strengths of two existing metaheuristics: the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and the dragonfly algorithm (DA). The aim of this hybridization is to reduce the problems of slow convergence and trapping into local optima, by striking a good balance between global and local search components of the constituent algorithms. On the other hand, we use the proposed metaheuristic to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as an alternative to existing traditional- and metaheuristic-based learning algorithms; this is for the purpose of improving overall accuracy by optimizing the set of MLP weights and biases. The proposed hybrid ABC/DA (HAD) algorithm comprises three main components: the static and dynamic swarming behavior phase in DA and two global search phases in ABC. The first one performs global search (DA phase), the second one performs local search (onlooker phase), and the third component implements global search (modified scout bee phase). The resultant metaheuristic optimizer is employed to train an MLP to reach a set of weights and biases that can yield high performance compared to traditional learning algorithms or even other metaheuristic optimizers. The proposed algorithm was first evaluated using 33 benchmark functions to test its performance in numerical optimization problems. Later, using HAD for training MLPs was evaluated against six standard classification datasets. In both cases, the performance of HAD was compared with the performance of several new and old metaheuristic methods from swarm intelligence and evolutionary computing. Experimental results show that HAD algorithm is clearly superior to the standard ABC and DA algorithms, as well as to other well-known algorithms, in terms of achieving the best optimal value, convergence speed, avoiding local minima and accuracy of trained MLPs. The proposed algorithm is a promising metaheuristic technique for general numerical optimization and for training MLPs. Specific applications and use cases are yet to be explored fully but they are supported by the encouraging results in this study. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC); Artificial intelligence (AI); Computation intelligence (CI); Dragonfly algorithm (DA); Global optimization problem; Multi-layer perceptron (MLP); Swarm intelligence (SI)","Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Evolutionary algorithms; Global optimization; Local search (optimization); Swarm intelligence; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Computation intelligences; Dragonfly algorithm (DA); Global optimization problems; Multi layer perceptron; Learning algorithms","","","","","Apex Foundation, (308/AIPS/415401); Universiti Sains Malaysia","Funding This study was funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia Fellowship (grant number [APEX (308/AIPS/415401)]) and the RUI grant, Account No. [1001/PKOMP/8014017] also under the Universiti Sains Malaysia.","Kim S.-S., McLoone S., Byeon J.-H., Lee S., Liu H., Cognitively inspired artificial bee colony clustering for cognitive wireless sensor networks, Cogn Comput, 9, 2, pp. 207-224, (2017); Fernandez-Caballero A., Gonzalez P., Navarro E., Cognitively-inspired computing for gerontechnology, Cogn Comput, 8, 2, pp. 297-298, (2016); Bonabeau E., Dorigo M., Theraulaz G., Swarm intelligence: from natural to artificial systems, (1999); Mavrovouniotis M., Li C., Yang S., A survey of swarm intelligence for dynamic optimization: algorithms and applications, Swarm Evol Comput, 33, pp. 1-17, (2017); Chen J., Zeng Z., Jiang P., Tang H., Deformation prediction of landslide based on functional network, Neurocomputing, 149, pp. 151-157, (2015); Ghanem W.A.H.M., Jantan A., Using hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm and particle swarm optimization for training feed-forward neural networks, J Theor Appl Inf Technol, 67, 3, (2014); Mirjalili S.A., Hashim S.Z.M., Sardroudi H.M., Training feedforward neural networks using hybrid particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm, Appl Math Comput, 218, 22, pp. 11125-11137, (2012); Ghanem W.A.H.M., Jantan A., Novel multi-objective artificial bee Colony optimization for wrapper based feature selection in intrusion detection, Int J Adv Soft Comput Appl, 8, 1, (2016); Bandaru S., Ng A.H.C., Deb K., Data mining methods for knowledge discovery in multi-objective optimization: Part A-Survey, Expert Syst Appl, 70, pp. 139-159, (2017); Ali M.H., Al Mohammed B.A.D., Ismail A., Zolkipli M.F., A new intrusion detection system based on Fast Learning Network and Particle swarm optimization, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 20255-20261, (2018); Ghanem W.A.H.M., Jantan A., New approach to improve anomaly detection using a neural network optimized by hybrid abc and pso algorithms, Pak J Stat, 34, 1, (2018); Han X., Chang X., Quan L., Xiong X., Li J., Zhang Z., Liu Y., Feature subset selection by gravitational search algorithm optimization, Inf Sci, 281, pp. 128-146, (2014); Aljarah I., Al-Zoubi A., Faris H., Hassonah M.A., Mirjalili S., Saadeh H., Simultaneous feature selection and support vector machine optimization using the grasshopper optimization algorithm, Cogn Comput, pp. 1-18, (2018); Yang X.-S., A new metaheuristic bat-inspired algorithm, Nature inspired cooperative strategies for optimization (NICSO 2010), pp. 65-74, (2010); Yangdeb X.-S.S., Cuckoo search via Lévy flights, Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing, 2009.

Fewer efforts have been made for devising techniques, tools and methodologies for investigation and evaluation of privacy risks. We are concerned about privacy diagnosis before starting protection. Actually we show privacy leakages threaten data publication. We introduce a Privacy Diagnosis Centre for this purpose. In this paper toward this diagnosis centre we focus on anonymity and, in particular, k-anonymity. Then we aim at k-anonymity diagnosis system. Such a system explores various questions about k-anonymity of data. ""For which k is my data k-anonymous?"", ""is my data sufficiently k-anonymous?"", ""which subset and projection of data can be safely published to guarantee given k?"", ""which information, if available from an outside source, threatens the k-anonymity of my data?"" are examples of questions can be answered. We leverage two properties of k-anonymity that we express in the form of two lemmas. The first lemma is a monotonicity property that enables us to adapt the a-priori algorithm for k-anonymity. The second lemma, however, is a determinism property that enables us to devise an efficient algorithm for δ-suppression. We illustrate and empirically analyze the performance of the proposed algorithms.","","Algorithms; Data publications; Diagnosis systems; K-Anonymity; K-anonymization; Monotonicity property; Privacy preservation; Privacy risks; Data privacy","","","","","","","Sweeney L., k-Anonymity: A Model for Protecting Privacy, International Journal on Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-based Systems, 10, pp. 557-570, (2002); Machanavajjhala A., Kifer D., Gehrke J., Venkitasubramaniam M., l-Diversity: Privacy beyond k-Anonymity, IEEE 22nd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE'06), (2006); Wong R.C.-W., Li J., Fu A.W.-C., Wang K., (alpha, k)-Anonymity: An Enhanced k-Anonymity Model for Privacy Preserving Data Publishing, 12th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), (2006); Li N., Li T., Venkatasubramanian S., t-Closeness: Privacy Beyond k-Anonymity and l-Diversity, IEEE 23rd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), Istanbul, pp. 106-115, (2007); Agrawal R., Imielinski T., Swami A., Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases, ACM Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD), pp. 207-216, (1993); Samarati P., Sweeney L., Protecting Privacy when Disclosing Information: k-Anonymity and its Enforcement through Generalization and Suppression, Technical Report SRI-CSL-98-04, (1998); Byun J.-W., Kamra A., Bertino E., Li N., Efficient k-Anonymity Using Clustering Technique, Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security, (2006); Aggarwal C.C., On k-Anonymity and the Curse of Dimensionality, Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) Conference, pp. 901-909, (2005); Sweeney L., Achieving k-Anonymity Privacy Protection Using Generalizing and Suppression, International Journal on Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-based Systems, 10, pp. 571-588, (2002); Aggarwal G., Feder T., Kenthapadi K., Khuller S., Panigrahy R., Thomas D., Zhu A., Achieving Anonymity via Clustering, Principles of Database Systems(PODS) Chicago, (2006); Iyengar V., Transforming Data to Satisfy Privacy Constraints, SIGKDD, pp. 279-288, (2002); Xu J., Wang W., Pei J., Wang X., Shi B., Fu A.W.-C., Utility-based Anonymization Using Local Recoding, 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, (2006); Fung B.C.M., Wang K., Yu P.S., Top-down Specialization for Information and Privacy Preservation, 21st International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), pp. 205-216, (2005); LeFevre K., DeWitt D.J., Ramakrishnan R., Incognito: Efficient Full-domain k-Anonymity, ACM Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD), pp. 49-60, (2005); LeFevre K., DeWitt D.J., Ramakrishnan R., Mondrian Multidimensional k-Anonymity, 22nd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), (2006); Xiao X., Tao Y., Anatomy: Simple and Effective Privacy Preservation, Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) Conference, pp. 139-150, (2006); Motwani R., Xu Y., Efficient Algorithms for Masking and Finding Quasi-Identifiers, Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) Conference, (2007); Samarati P., Protecting Respondents' Identities in Microdata Release, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 13, pp. 1010-1027, (2001); Wang K., Fung B.C.M., Anonymizing Sequential Releases, 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining Philadelphia, pp. 414-423, (2006); Li J., Wong R.C.-W., Fu A.W.-C., Pei J., Achieving k-Anonymity by Clustering in Attribute Hierarchical Structures, Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery (LNCS). vol. 4081: Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, pp. 405-416, (2006); Blake C., Merz C., UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases, (1998); Bayardo R.J., Agrawal R., Data Privacy through Optimal k-Anonymization, 21st International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), (2005)","M.R.Z.

However, getting a clear view of the events relevant to the incident from a large set of data, such as social media, is a challenging task. Automation of the forensic and analysis process is the only solution to manage large data sets and get useful information. However, automation in digital forensics is a technical issue with legal implications. The legal system accepts only those automated processes that are reproducible, explainable, and rigorously testable. Therefore, automated forensic processes must be based on formal theories, which are rare in digital forensics. This article explains a theoretical and formal knowledge model for forensic automation on online social networks. This model consists of an event-based knowledge model, which provides theoretical concepts that can assist in the construction and interpretation of the events related to the incident under investigation. The proposed model is implemented through an ontology to provide semantically rich and formal representation to the concepts. This article also describes the feasibility of legally acceptable automated analysis operators, based on a formal theory, for online social network forensics. © 2019","Forensic automation; Forensic ontology; Formal model; Knowledge model; Online social network forensics","Automation; Computer crime; Electronic crime countermeasures; Forensic engineering; Ontology; Social networking (online); Automated analysis; Automated process; Formal model; Formal representations; Knowledge model; Legal implications; On-line social networks; Social media networks; Digital forensics","","","","","","","Aledavood T., Lehmann S., Saramaki J., On the digital daily cycles of individuals, Front.

The current strategies used to achieve covertness of communication employs encryption. Encryption techniques minimize eavesdropping on the conversation between the conversing parties by transforming the message into an unreadable form. However, it does not prevent or discourage eavesdroppers from stealing and attempting to decrypt the encrypted messages using a brute-force attack or by randomly guessing the key. The probability of the eavesdropper acquiring the key and recovering the message is high as he/she can distinguish a correct key from incorrect keys based on the output of the decryption. This is because a message has some structure-texts, pictures, and videos. Thus, an attempt at decrypting with a wrong key yields random gibberish that does not comply with the expected structure. Furthermore, the consistent increase in computational power implies that stolen encrypted data may gradually debilitate to a brute-force attack. Thus, causing the eavesdropper to learn the content of the message. To this end, the objective of this research is to reinforce the current encryption measures with a decoy-based deception model where the eavesdropper is discouraged from stealing encrypted message by confounding his resources and time. Our proposed model leverages its foundation from decoys, deception, and artificial intelligence. An instant messaging application was developed and integrated with the proposed model as a proof of concept. Further details regarding the design, analysis, and implementation of the proposed model are substantiated. The result shows that the proposed model reinforces state-of-the-art encryption schemes and will serve as an effective component for discouraging eavesdropping and curtailing brute-force attack on encrypted messages. © 2013 IEEE.","Attacker; brute-force; chat; deception; decoy; eavesdropper; encryption and instant messaging","Artificial intelligence; Security systems; Social networking (online); Brute-force attack; Computational power; Encrypted messages; Encryption schemes; Encryption technique; Instant messaging; Proof of concept; Social network systems; Cryptography","","","","","University of Southern Maine, USM, (1001/PKCOMP/8014017)","This work was supported in part by the USM RUI, Penang, Malaysia, under Grant 1001/PKCOMP/8014017, and in part by the Center for Cyber Safety and Education, United States Internal Revenue Segregated Fund of (ISC)2, Inc.

Nowadays malware writers try to avoid detection by using several techniques such as polymorphic, hiding and also zero day of attack. However, commercial anti-virus or anti-spyware that used signature-based matching to detects malware cannot solve that kind of attack. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a new framework for malware detection that combines signature-based technique and genetic algorithm technique. This framework consists of three main components such as s-based detection, GA detection and signature generator. These three main components will work together as interrelated process in our propose framework.

In fact, attack intention analysis is a prediction factor to help investigators conclude a case with high accuracy. However, current techniques in attack intention analysis only focus on recognizing alert correlation for certain evidence. In reality, investigator should use more prediction factors decision such as attack intention, strategy, and incident path to come to a more precise decision. This paper proposes an Attack Intention Analysis (AIA) algorithm that focuses on the reasoning of attacks of uncertain intentions. A new algorithm will be introduced using a combination of a mathematical Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory with a probabilistic technique through a causal network to predict an attack intention. The algorithm uses the D-S theory as an efficient method for identifying uncertain intentions, and gives the probability for intentions that could be ignored or discarded. Furthermore, the casual network could represent the probabilistic relationship of attacks, evidence and their intentions. We found that by analyzing the intention of the attacker, forensic investigation agents will be able to audit and perform their investigations effectively and efficiently. Experiments were performed on packet capture (PCAP) where network data traffic holds a backdoor attack to evaluate the proposed algorithm. From the observations, AIA may constitute a clear and important factor for helping investigator to make decision.","Attacks intention; Backdoor attack; Causal network; D-S theory; Network forensics investigation","Algorithms; Decision making; Decision theory; Forecasting; Investments; Attacks intention; Backdoor attack; Causal network; DS theory; Network forensics investigation; Computer crime","","","","","","","Yasinsac A.M.Y., Honeytraps, a network forensic tool, Proceedings of the Sixth Multiconference On Systemic, pp. 1-6, (2002); Pilli E.S., Joshi R.C., Niyogi R., Network forensic frameworks: Survey and research challenges, Digital Investigation: International Journal of Dig.

In honeybee colonies, guards discriminate nestmates from non-nestmates at a hive entrance using an approach contains Undesirable-Absent (UA) or Desirable-Present (DP), and Filtering Decision (FD) methods. These methods are used to detect intruder and classify its type. In the proposed approach, the UA detector is responsible for detecting pre-defined attacks based on their attack signatures. Neural network trained by Bees Algorithm (BA) was used to learn the patterns of attacks given in training dataset and use these patterns to find specific attacks in test dataset. The DP detector is responsible for detecting anomalous behaviours based on the trained normal behaviour model. Finally, FD method is used to train the UA detector in real-time to detect new intrusions. The performance of the proposed IDS is evaluated by using KDD'99 dataset, the benchmark dataset used by IDS researchers. The experiments show that the proposed approach is applied successfully and able to detect many different types of intrusions, while maintaining a low false positive rate. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","bees algorithm; honeybee approach; Intrusion detection system; neural networks","Algorithms; Computer crime; Detectors; Finite difference method; Network security; Neural networks; Software engineering; Statistical tests; Attack signature; Bees algorithms; Behaviour models; Benchmark datasets; Data sets; False positive rates; honeybee approach; Honeybee colonies; Intrusion detection system; Intrusion detection systems; Training dataset; Intrusion detection","","","","","","","Deloitte's Center for Security & Privacy Solutions, (2010); Anderson J.P., Computer Security Threat Monitoring and Surveillance, (1980); Rains G.C., Tomberlin J.K., Kulasiri D., Using insect sniffing devices for detection, Trends in Biotechnology, 26, 6, pp. 288-294, (2008); Srinoy S., Intrusion Detection Model Based on Particle Swarm Optimization and Support Vector Machine, Computational Intelligence in Security and Defense Applications, CISDA 2007, pp. 186-192, (2007); Couvillon M.J., Et al., En garde: Rapid shifts in honeybee, Apis mellifera, guarding behaviour are triggered by onslaught of conspecific intruders, Animal Behaviour, 76, 5, pp. 1653-1658, (2008); Butler C.G., The F.J., Behaviour of worker honeybees at the hive entrance, Behaviour, 4, pp. 263-291, (1952); Stein G., Chen B., Wu A.S., Hua K.A., Decision tree classifier for network intrusion detection with GA-based feature selection, Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Southeast Regional Conference - Volume 2 (ACM-SE 43), 2, pp. 136-141, (2005); Pham D.T., Ghanbarzadeh A., Koc E., Otri S., Rahim S., Zaidi M., The bees algorithm - A novel tool for complex optimisation problems, Proceedings of IPROMS, Conference, Cardiff, UK, pp. 454-461, (2006); Pham D.T., Ghanbarzadeh A., Koc E., Otri S., Application of the bees algorithm to the training of radial basis function networks for control chart pattern recognition, Proceedings of 5th CIRP International Seminar on Intelligent Computation in Manufacturing Engineering (CIRP ICME 2006), Ischia, Italy (2006b); Pham D.T., Koc E., Ghanbarzadeh A., Otri S., Optimisation of the weights of multi-layered perceptrons using the bees algorithm, Proceedings of 5th International Symposium on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (2006); Kitching I.J., Phylogeny of the death's head hawkmoths, Acherontia[Laspeyres], and related genera, Systematic Entomology, pp. 71-88, (2003); Breed D.E., Guzman-Novoa G.J., 3 Hunt, Defensive behavior of honey bees: Organization, genetics, and comparisons with other Bees, Annual Review of Entomology, 49, pp. 271-298, (2004); Ali G.A., Jantan A., Ali A., Honeybee-Based Model to Detect Intrusion, LNCS, 5576, pp. 598-607, (2009); Ryan J., Lin M.J., Miikkulainen R., Intrusion Detection with Neural Networks, (1998); Wang G., Hao J., Ma J., Huang L., A new approach to intrusion detection using Artificial Neural Networks and fuzzy clustering, Expert Syst.

The proposed algorithm is based on the Bat Algorithm (BA), which is inspired by the micro-bat echolocation phenomenon, and addresses the problems of local-optima trapping and low precision using an adjusted mutation operator from the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm. The proposed Hybrid Bat Harmony (HBH) algorithm attempts to balance the good exploitation process of BA with a fast exploration feature inspired by HS. The design of HBH is introduced and its performance is evaluated against fourteen of the standard benchmark functions, and compared to that of the standard BA and HS algorithms and to another recent hybrid algorithm (HS/BA). The obtained results show that the new HBH method is indeed a promising addition to the arsenal of metaheuristic algorithms and can outperform the original BA and HS algorithms.","Bat algorithm; Global optimization problem; Harmony search algorithm; Pitch adjustment operator","Benchmarking; Global optimization; Problem solving; Bat algorithms; Benchmark functions; Global optimization problems; Harmony search algorithms; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic approach; Numerical optimizations; Pitch adjustments; Optimization","","","","","University of Southern Maine, USM; Apex Foundation, (1002/CIPS/ ATSG4001, 203/PKOMP/6711426); Universiti Sains Malaysia","This research was funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia under USM Fellowship 2016 [APEX (1002/CIPS/ ATSG4001)], Also partially supported by the Fundamental Rsearch Grant Scheme (FRGS) for “Content Based Analysis Framework for Better Email Forensic and Cyber Investigation” [203/PKOMP/6711426].","Sorensen K., Glover F.W., Metaheuristics, Encyclopedia of Operations Research and Management Science, pp. 960-970, (2013); Eberhart R.C., Kennedy J., A new optimizer using particle swarm theory, Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Micro Machine and Human Science, (1995); Dorigo M., Birattari M., Stutzle T., Ant colony optimization, Computational Intelligence Magazine, IEEE, 1, 4, pp. 28-39, (2006); Dorigo M., Maniezzo V., Colorni A., Ant system: Optimization by a colony of cooperating agents, Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on, 26, 1, pp. 29-41, (1996); Karaboga D., An Idea Based on Honey Bee Swarm for Numerical Optimization, (2005); Karaboga D., Basturk B., A powerful and efficient algorithm for numerical function optimization: Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, Journal of Global Optimization, 39, 3, pp. 459-471, (2007); Yang X.-S., Nature-inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms, (2010); Yang X.-S., Deb S., Cuckoo search via Lévy flights, Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing, (2009); Simon D., Biogeography-based optimization, Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on, 12, 6, pp. 702-713, (2008); Li X., Zhang J., Yin M., Animal migration optimization: An optimization algorithm inspired by animal migration behavior, Neural Computing and Applications, 24, 7-8, pp. 1867-1877, (2014); Meng X., Et al., A new bio-inspired algorithm: Chicken swarm optimization, Advances in Swarm Intelligence, pp. 86-94, (2014); Mirjalili S., Mirjalili S.M., Lewis A., Grey Wolf optimizer, Advances in Engineering Software, 69, pp. 46-61, (2014); Gandomi A.H., Alavi A.H., Krill herd: A new bio-inspired optimization algorithm, Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation, 17, 12, pp. 4831-4845, (2012); Wang G.-G., Deb S., Cui Z., Monarch butterfly optimization, Neural Computing and Applications, pp. 1-20, (2015); Yang X.-S., A new metaheuristic bat-inspired algorithm, Nature Inspired Cooperative Strategies for Optimization (NICSO 2010), pp. 65-74, (2010); Kirkpatrick S., Vecchi M.P., Optimization by simmulated annealing, Science, 220, 4598, pp. 671-680, (1983); Geem Z.W., Kim J.H., Loganathan G., A new heuristic optimization algorithm: Harmony search, Simulation, 76, 2, pp. 60-68, (2001); Wang G., Guo L., A novel hybrid bat algorithm with harmony search for global numerical optimization, Journal of Applied Mathematics, (2013)","","Vasant P.; Duy V.H.","EAI","","1st EAI International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering, COMPSE 2016","11 November 2016 through 12 November 2016","Penang","130814","","978-163190136-2","","","English","COMPSE - EAI Int.

In network forensic analysis, evidence is the crucial elements in the investigation process. However, gathering evidences from network is quite difficult because of the large amount of data in the network system. In addition, getting filtered data for analysis purpose is still a major issue for forensic professional. To contribute in solving the problems, we propose Forensic-based Intrusion Detection System (F-IDS), a new framework to simplify evidences gathering from network by utilizing mechanisms available on the structure of general IDS, the IDS structure will be examined and then enhanced so that the network packet collected by the IDS will be channeled and stored for forensic analysis purpose, also a proper mechanism to identify prospective evidences from the traffic will be proposed.

Frequency l-diversity is possibly the most practical instance of the generic l-diversity principle for privacy preservation. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for frequency l-diversification. Our primary objective is to minimize information loss. Most studies in privacy preservation have focused on k-anonymization. While simple principles of l-diversification algorithms can be obtained by adapting k-anonymization algorithms it is not straightforward for some other principles. Our algorithm, called Bucket Clustering, adapts k-member Clustering. However, in order to guarantee termination we use hashing and buckets as in the Anatomy algorithm. In order to minimize information loss we choose tuples that minimize information loss during the creation of clusters. We empirically show that our algorithm achieves low information loss with acceptable efficiency. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","","Anonymization; Information loss; K-anonymization; Member clustering; Primary objective; Privacy preservation; Clustering algorithms","","","","","","","Bayardo R.J., Agrawal R., Data Privacy through Optimal k-Anonymization, 21st International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), (2005); Xiao X., Tao Y., Anatomy: Simple and Effective Privacy Preservation, Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) Conference, pp. 139-150, (2006); Sweeney L., k-Anonymity: A Model for Protecting Privacy, International Journal on Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-based Systems, 10, pp. 557-570, (2002); Samarati P., Sweeney L., Protecting Privacy when Disclosing Information: K-Anonymity and its Enforcement through Generalization and Suppression, (1998); Iyengar V., Transforming Data to Satisfy Privacy Constraints, SIGKDD, pp. 279-288, (2002); LeFevre K., DeWitt D.J., Ramakrishnan R., Mondrian Multidimensional k-Anonymity, 22nd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), (2006); Ghinita G., Karras P., Kalnis P., Mamoulis N., Fast Data Anonymization with Low Information Loss, Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) Conference, (2007); Blake C., Merz C., UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases, (1998)","M.-R.

When a key is used more than once in the One-Time Pad encryption scheme, it becomes vulnerable to a pattern analysis attack (known-Plaintext attack). For this reason, the same key must not be used more than once.This problem can be resolved by modifying the algorithm and enhancing the key so that any statistical relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext will be completely concealed. The methodology employed was a combination of some cryptographic primitives to introduce diffusion into the system and a simple randomized form of steganography to hide where the encryption begins. The performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated against the One-Time Pad when the pads were used more than once and a cryptanalysis was performed on both schemes. The result indicates that the enhanced OTP algorithm was suitable to allow the same key for limitless use of encrypting different Plaintext without revealing any pattern. This will solve the key management/distribution problem of having to send a new key everytime a message is to be transmitted and this allows the One-Time Pad scheme practical and allows the same key generated during encryption to be reusable on other Plaintext as many times as desired. © 2018 Newswood Limited.

Most of the recent efforts that address diversity have focused on extending of k-anonymization methods to satisfy diversity as well. In this paper we show that diversity is lonely sufficient to protect private information of individuals and no need to apply k-anonymity first. Moreover l-diversity is stronger than k-anonymity and even some simple proposed techniques (like Anatomy) that consider only diversity are better than advanced k-anonymization techniques from privacy preservation point of view. We show all the cases by different scenarios and explain how diversity outperforms k-anonymity. Only in the case with some restricted assumptions about external data, some k-anonymization techniques give some protection in addition to l-diversity. We show even in this case the anonymity is related to number of tuples in external data instead of k, which is not so realistic. © 2008 IEEE.","","Information technology; Anonymization; External-; Privacy preservations; Private informations; Sensitive informations; Data privacy","","","","","","","Aggarwal C.C., On k-Anonymity and the Curse of Dimensionality, 31st VLDB Conference, pp. 901-909, (2005); Fung B.C.M., Wang K., Yu P.S., Top-down Specialization for Information and Privacy Preservation, ICDE, pp. 205-216, (2005); Iyengar V., Transforming Data to Satisfy Privacy Constraints, SIGKDD, pp. 279-288, (2002); LeFevre K., DeWitt D.J., Ramakrishnan R., Incognito: Efficient Full-domain k-Anonymity, SIGMOD, pp. 49-60, (2005); LeFevre K., DeWitt D.J., Ramakrishnan R., Mondrian Multidimensional k-Anonymity, (2006); Machanavajjhala A., Gehrke J., Kifer D., IEEE 22nd International Conference on Data Engineering, 50, (2006); Samarati P., Sweeney L., Protecting Privacy when Disclosing Information: K-Anonymity and its Enforcement through Generalization and Suppression, (1998); Sweeney L., Achieving k-Anonymity Privacy Protection Using Generalizing and Suppression, International Journal on Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-based Systems, 10, pp. 571-588, (2002); Sweeney L., k-Anonymity: A Model for Protecting Privacy, International Journal on Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-based Systems, 10, pp. 557-570, (2002); Truta T.M., Fotouhi F., Barth-Jones D., Global Disclosure Risk for Microdata with Continuous Attributes, Privacy and Technologies of Identity: A Cross Disciplinary Conversation, pp. 349-364, (2006)","M.

Honey Encryption is an encryption scheme that provides resilience against brute-force attack by serving up plausible-looking but fake plaintext for every invalid key used by an intruder to decrypt a message. Our goal is to furnish researchers with the framework of the scheme not just for implementation purpose but to identify the gaps in the scheme and answer the open questions that remain unanswered by the small set of research carried out since its inception. We identified two major open areas which are the difficulty of creating semantically and contextually plausible-looking and convincing decoy message that is good enough to fool the attacker into believing he has the original message. Secondly, typo problem; where a fake plaintext appears valid to a legitimate user when he mistakenly enters a wrong key. Our findings consolidate the need for further research as state-of-the-art research fails to produce convincing decoys that are good enough to keep the attacker from acquiring the message. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The model investigates these users by measuring their bandwidth consumption ratios. User traffic that exceeds the service-level agreement bandwidth ratio is filtered as intrusive.

The next decade is likely to witness a considerable rise to attack on private and commercial networks unless this problem is curbed. To resolve these threats, there is a need for a countermeasure for preventing and handling APTs on operating system such as windows. Therefore, this paper seeks to address this issue using MITRE, Adversary Tactics Techniques, and common Knowledge Matrix by applying Login Scripts technique. In this context, we demonstrate how APT can gain access and control an entire infrastructure. In addition, we use setoolkit social engineering in Kali Linux distribution to create the payload. Consequently, this paper sheds new light on how organization build a lot of security devices inside their infrastructure, but unfortunately, forget two important things. Firstly, the leniency in creating and raising security awareness, and secondly leniency designing, implementing, and updating of information security policy.

By quantifying the causal inference process, we can determine the attack detection and the severity of odd packets. As such, packets with low causal relations to attacks can be dropped or ignored and/or packets with high causal relations to attacks are to be highlighted.

This importance is due to the connectivity benefits that can be given by networks, such as computing power, data sharing and enhanced performance. However using networks comes with a cost, there are some threats and issues that need to be addressed, such as providing sufficient level of security. One of the most challenging issues in network security is network scanning. Network scanning is considered to be the initial step in any attacking process. Therefore, detecting networks scanning helps to protect networks resources, services, and data before the real attack happens. This paper proposes an approach that consists of three layers to detect Sequential and Random network scanning for both TCP and UDP protocols. The proposed Three Layers Approach aims to increase network scanning detection accuracy. The Three Layers Approach defines some packets to be used as signs of network scanning existence. Before applying the approach in a network, there is a Thresholds Generation Stage to that aims to determine descriptive set of thresholds. After that, the first layer of the approach aggregates sign packets in separated tables. Then the second layer of the approach analyzes these tables in new tables by counting packets generated by each IP. Finally, the last layer makes a decision of whether or not a network is being scanned. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

However, privacy concerns represent one of the major threats facing the electronic health record system. For instance, a cybercriminal may use a brute-force attack to authenticate into a patient’s account to steal the patient’s personal, medical or genetic details. This threat is amplified given that an individual’s genetic content is connected to their family, thus leading to security risks for their family members as well. Several cases of patient’s data theft have been reported where cybercriminals authenticated into the patient’s account, stole the patient’s medical data and assumed the identity of the patients. In some cases, the stolen data were used to access the patient’s accounts on other platforms and in other cases, to make fraudulent health insurance claims. Several measures have been suggested to address the security issues in electronic health record systems. Nevertheless, we emphasize that current measures proffer security in the short-term. This work studies the feasibility of using a decoy-based system named HoneyDetails in the security of the electronic health record system. HoneyDetails will serve fictitious medical data to the adversary during his hacking attempt to steal the patient’s data. However, the adversary will remain oblivious to the deceit due to the realistic structure of the data. Our findings indicate that the proposed system may serve as a potential measure for safeguarding against patient’s information theft. © The Author(s) 2020.","adversary; attacker; deception; decoys; electronic health record; encryption; patient; privacy and security","Computer Security; Confidentiality; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Privacy; adult; article; deception; electronic health record; feasibility study; gene amplification; health insurance; human; male; privacy; theft; computer security; confidentiality","","","","","School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKCOMP/8014017, 11800)","Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: Center for Cyber Safety and Education, United States Internal Revenue segregated fund of (ISC) 2, Inc.

One of the Botnet evasion techniques is by hiding their command and control communication over an encrypted channel like SSL and TLS. This paper provides a Botnet Analysis and Detection System (BADS) framework for detecting Botnet. The BADS framework has been used as a guideline to devise the methodology, and we divided this methodology into six phases: i. data collection, customization, and conversion, pp. feature extraction and feature selection, ipp. Botnet prediction and classification, iv. Botnet detection, v. attack notification, and vi. testing and evaluation. We tend to use the machine learning algorithm for Botnet prediction and classification. We also found several challenges in implementing this work. This research aims to detect Botnet over an encrypted channel with high accuracy, fast detection time, and provides autonomous management to the network manager. © 2013 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization.","Accuracy; Autonomous; Botnet; Botnet analysis and detection system (BADS); Encrypted channel; Machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Cryptography; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Accuracy; Analysis system; Autonomous; Botnet analyse and detection system; Botnets; Command and control; Control communications; Detection system; Encrypted channel; Botnet","","","","","","","Soloman A., Evron G., The World of Botnet, Virus Bulletin, (2006); Security Press Release, Botnets Threaten National Infrastructure and Security, (2006); Thomas V., Jyoti N., Virus Bulletin, Defeating IRC Bots on the Internal Network, (2007); MyCERT Incident Statistics; Zhang H., Detecting Advanced Botnets in Enteririse Networks, (2017); Burghouwt P., Detection of Botnet Command and Control Traffic in Enteririse Networks, (2015); Nicholson P., What Lies Beneath: Advanced Attacks that Hide in SSL Traffic, (2015); Paganini P., SSL Blacklist A New Weaion to Fight Malware and Botnet, (2014); Gebhart G., We Are Halfway to Encryiting The Entire Web, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Reiort, (2017); Finley K., Half of the Web is Now Encryited.

However, commercial anti-virus or anti-spyware that used signature-based matching to detects malware cannot solve that kind of threats. Nowadays malware writers try to avoid detection by using several techniques such as polymorphic, metamorphic and also hiding technique. In order to overcome that issue, we proposed a new framework for malware behavior identification and classification that apply dynamic approach. This framework consists of two major processes such as behavior identification and malware classification. These two major processes will integrate together as interrelated process in our proposed framework.

The idea is to improve the balance between the characteristics of exploration and exploitation in those algorithms in order to address the issues of trapping in local optimal solution, slow convergence, and low accuracy in numerical optimization problems. This article introduces a new hybrid approach by modifying the butterfly adjusting operator in MBO algorithm and uses that as a mutation operator to replace employee phase of the ABC algorithm. The new algorithm is called Hybrid ABC/MBO (HAM). The HAM algorithm is basically employed to boost the exploration versus exploitation balance of the original algorithms, by increasing the diversity of the ABC search process using a modified operator from MBO algorithm. The resultant design contains three components: The first and third component implements global search, while the second one performs local search. The proposed algorithm was evaluated using 13 benchmark functions and compared with the performance of nine metaheuristic methods from swarm intelligence and evolutionary computing: ABC, MBO, ACO, PSO, GA, DE, ES, PBIL, and STUDGA. The experimental results show that the HAM algorithm is clearly superior to the standard ABC and MBO algorithms, as well as to other well-known algorithms, in terms of achieving the best optimal value and convergence speed. The proposed HAM algorithm is a promising metaheuristic technique to be added to the repertory of optimization techniques at the disposal of researchers. The next step is to look into application fields for HAM. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Artificial bee colony algorithm; Computation intelligence; Global optimization problem; Monarch butterfly optimization algorithm","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Global optimization; Optimal systems; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Artificial bee colony algorithms; Computation intelligences; Exploration and exploitation; Global optimization problems; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic techniques; Optimization algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","","","","APEX, (1002/CIPS/ATSG4001, 203/PKOMP/6711426); University of Southern Maine, USM; Universiti Sains Malaysia","Funding text 1: This study was funded by USM Fellowship 2016 (Grant Number [APEX (1002/CIPS/ATSG4001)]) and the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) for “Content-Based Analysis Framework for Better Email Forensic and Cyber Investigation” [203/PKOMP/6711426]. ; Funding text 2: This research has been funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia under USM Fellowship 2016 [APEX (1002/CIPS/ATSG4001)], also partially supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) for “Content-Based Analysis Framework for Better Email Forensic and Cyber Investigation” [203/PKOMP/6711426].

However, in criminal justice proceedings, these electronic pieces of evidence are often considered with the utmost suspicion and uncertainty, although, on occasions are justifiable. Presently, the use of scientifically unproven forensic techniques are highly criticized in legal proceedings. Nevertheless, the exceedingly distinct and dynamic characteristics of electronic data, in addition to the current legislation and privacy laws remain as challenging aspects for systematically attesting evidence in a court of law. This article presents a comprehensive study to examine the issues that are considered essential to discuss and resolve, for the proper acceptance of evidence based on scientific grounds. Moreover, the article explains the state of forensics in emerging sub-fields of digital technology such as, cloud computing, social media, and the Internet of Things (IoT), and reviewing the challenges which may complicate the process of systematic validation of electronic evidence. The study further explores various solutions previously proposed, by researchers and academics, regarding their appropriateness based on their experimental evaluation. Additionally, this article suggests open research areas, highlighting many of the issues and problems associated with the empirical evaluation of these solutions for immediate attention by researchers and practitioners. Notably, academics must react to these challenges with appropriate emphasis on methodical verification. Therefore, for this purpose, the issues in the experiential validation of practices currently available are reviewed in this study. The review also discusses the struggle involved in demonstrating the reliability and validity of these approaches with contemporary evaluation methods. Furthermore, the development of best practices, reliable tools and the formulation of formal testing methods for digital forensic techniques are highlighted which could be extremely useful and of immense value to improve the trustworthiness of electronic evidence in legal proceedings. © 2018 KIPS.","Criminal investigation; Data; Digital forensics; Electronic evidence; Reliability; Validation; Verification","Computer crime; Crime; Distributed computer systems; Electronic crime countermeasures; Internet of things; Reliability; Verification; Criminal investigation; Data; Dynamic characteristics; Electronic evidences; Experimental evaluation; Internet of thing (IOT); Reliability and validity; Validation; Digital forensics","","","","","SFRG Lab, School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia","This research is partially supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) (No. 203/PKOMP/6711426), SFRG Lab, School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia.","Council N.R., Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward, (2009); President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, Report to the President Forensic Science in Criminal Courts: Ensuring Scientific Validity of Feature-Comparison Methods, (2016); Risinger D.M., Saks M.J., Thompson W.C., Rosenthal R., The Daubert/Kumho implications of observer effects in forensic science: hidden problems of expectation and suggestion, , California Law Review, 90, 1; Roberts P., Paradigms of forensic science and legal process: a critical diagnosis, , Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 370, 1674, (2015); Meyers M., Rogers M., Digital forensics: meeting the challenges of scientific evidence, , IFIP International Conference on Digital Forensics, pp. 43-50, (2005); Van Buskirk E., Liu V.T., Digital evidence: challenging the presumption of reliability, , Journal of Digital Forensic Practice, 1, 1, pp. 19-26, (2006); Edmond G., Mercer D., 'Trashing junk science, ', (1998); Behrents R.G., Lucy fell from a tree and plunged 40 feet to her death, , American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, 150, 5, pp. 719-722, (2016); Fradella H.F., Fogarty A., O'Neill L., The impact of Daubert on the admissibility of behavioral science testimony, , Pepperdine Law Review, 30, 3, pp. 403-444, (2002); Ryan D.J., Shpantzer G., 'Legal aspects of digital forensics, ', (2002); Garrie D.B., Digital forensic evidence in the courtroom: understanding content and quality, , Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property, 12, 2, (2014); Mahle S., 'An introduction to Daubert v.

Using synergistic threats to attack provides many success alternatives that lead to the same goal, which is to take over the network and carry out illegal mining activities using CPU resources from the victim's computer. One of the main motives for the success of this criminal business is its relatively low cost and high return of investment. Using the infection chain method in carrying out cryptocurrency mining malware attacks with fileless techniques involves loading malicious code into system memory. Monero (XMR) is by far the highest popular cryptocurrency among threat actor installing mining malware because it comes with full anonymity and resistance to an application-specific circuit mining (ASIC). This work proposes a better method for classifying conventional malware and cryptocurrency mining malware. On the other hand, grouping specific of suitable features extracted from the sources of EMBER dataset shown as malware and need to categorize as a cryptocurrency mining malware. The proposed approach is defining a better algorithm for enhancing accuracy and efficiency for cryptocurrency mining malware detection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Costs; Crime; Cryptocurrency; Machine learning; Application specific; Criminal business; Government agencies; Machine learning approaches; Malware detection; Mining activities; Private companies; Return of investments; Malware","","","","","University of Southern Maine, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315237)","members in the Security & Forensics Research Group, Universiti Sains Malaysia, for their helpful discussion and suggestion.

Availability of huge amounts of data increased the need for effective techniques to analyze and classify data accurately. Many algorithms in the field of swarm intelligence are able to contribute to improve the classification accuracy using the optimal algorithm methods. The optimal algorithms are used to select optimal features set. From this perspective, these algorithms are used to select the optimal feature of weights and biases for artificial neural network.

In fact, attack intention analysis is a prediction factor to help investigators to conclude a case with high accuracy. However, current techniques in attack intention analysis only focus on recognizing an alert correlation for certain evidence and predicting future attacks. In reality, more prediction factors should be used by the investigators to come to a more concise decision such as attack intention, incident path ..., etc. This paper will propose an attack intention analysis model, which focus on reasoning of attacks under uncertainty intention. A new model will be introduced using a combination of a mathematical Dempster- Shafer (D-S) evidence theory with a probabilistic technique through a causal network to predict an attack intention. We found that by analyzing the attacker's intention, forensic investigation agents will be able to audit and perform evidence in an efficient way. Experiments were performed on samples of probability of attack intentions to evaluate the proposed model. Arguably, attack intention analysis model may produce a clear and impact factor for investigator decision-making. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","attacks intention; causal network; D-S theory; network forensics investigation","Decision making; Forecasting; Forensic engineering; Investments; Software engineering; Uncertainty analysis; Alert correlation; Analysis models; attacks intention; Causal network; Dempster-shafer; DS theory; Evidence theories; Forensic investigation; Impact factor; Network forensics; network forensics investigation; New model; Probabilistic technique; Probability of attack; Computer crime","","","","","","","Yasinsac A., Honeytraps M.Y., A network forensic tool, Proceedings of the Sixth Multi-Conference on Systemics, Florida, USA (2002); Pilli E.S., Joshi R.C., Niyogi R., Network forensic frameworks: Survey and research challenges, Digital Investigation, (2010); Almulhem A., Network forensics: Notions and challenges, IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology, ISSPIT (2009); Rogers M.K., Seigfried K., The future of computer forensics: A needs analysis survey, Computers & Security, 23, 1, pp. 12-16, (2004); Huang M.-Y., Jasper R.J., Wicks T.M., A large scale distributed intrusion detection framework based on attack strategy analysis, Computer Networks, 31, 23-24, pp. 2465-2475, (1999); Casey E., Case study: Network intrusion investigation - Lessons in forensic preparation, Digital Investigation, 2, 4, pp. 254-260, (2005); Peng W., Yao S., Chen J., Recognizing Intrusive Intention and Assessing Threat Based on Attack Path Analysis, International Conference on Multimedia Information Networking and Security, MINES, (2009); Siti Rahayu Selamat R.Y., Sahib S., Mapping Process of Digital Forensic Investigation Framework, IJCSNS International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 8, 10, pp. 163-169, (2008); Qin X., Lee W., Attack plan recognition and prediction using causal networks, 20th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (2004); Shafer G., A Mathematical Theory of Evidence, (1976); Burrus N., Lesage D., Theory of Evidence (DRAFT), (2003); Wang Z., Peng W., An Intrusive Intention Recognition Model Based on Network Security States Graph, 5th International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing, WiCom 2009 (2009); Peng W., Et al., Recognizing Intrusive Intention Based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks, International Symposium on Information Engineering and Electronic Commerce, IEEC 2009(2009); Zeng D., Xu J., Xu G., Data Fusion for Traffic Incident Detector Using D-S Evidence Theory with Probabilistic SVMs, Journal of Computers, 3, 10, pp. 36-43, (2008); Bonnie Brinton A., Et al., The application of model checking for securing e-commerce transactions, Commun.

This study provides an empirical model to detect individual terrorist using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profiling. In the research design and analysis approach, four metric values of DNA materials guanine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine form a dataset were assigned to a sample of a hundred people and tested using regression analysis. The tests were conducted to generate a mathematical model that minimizes errors in the experiment. After model evaluations and validations, the result shows 99.43% detection rate accuracy. The model was used to measure the weight of individual involvement in crime such as cybercrime, and terrorism as presented by the people’s DNA test. The result from this study performs better when compared with the recent studies of other state-of-the-art techniques such as text analysis, machine learning algorithms, data mining, high efficiency video coding detection and statistical mixture models identification.

It has been confirmed that this algorithm has good ability to search for the global optimum, but it suffers from the fact that the global best solution is not directly used, but the ABC stores it at each iteration, unlike the particle swarm optimization (PSO) that can directly use the global best solution at each iteration. So the hybrid of artificial bee colony Algorithm (ABC) and PSO resolved the aforementioned problem. In this article, Hybrid ABC and PSO is used as new training method for Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs), in order to get rid of imperfections in traditional training algorithms and get the high efficiencies of these algorithms in reducing the computational complexity and the problems of Tripping in local minima, also reduction of slow convergence rate of current evolutionary learning algorithms. We test the accuracy of our proposal using FFNNs trained with ABC, PSO, and Hybrid ABC and PSO. The experimental results show that ABCPSO outperforms both ABC and PSO for training FFNNs in terms the aforementioned Imperfections. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

Although significant progress achieved and surveyed in addressing ANN application to PR challenges, nevertheless, some problems are yet to be resolved like whimsical orientation (the unknown path that cannot be accurately calculated due to its directional position). Other problem includes; object classification, location, scaling, neurons behavior analysis in hidden layers, rule, and template matching. Also, the lack of extant literature on the issues associated with ANN application to PR seems to slow down research focus and progress in the field. Hence, there is a need for state-of-the-art in neural networks application to PR to urgently address the above-highlights problems for more successes. The study furnishes readers with a clearer understanding of the current, and new trend in ANN models that effectively addresses PR challenges to enable research focus and topics. Similarly, the comprehensive review reveals the diverse areas of the success of ANN models and their application to PR. In evaluating the performance of ANN models, some statistical indicators for measuring the performance of the ANN model in many studies were adopted. Such as the use of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and variance of absolute percentage error (VAPE). The result shows that the current ANN models such as GAN, SAE, DBN, RBM, RNN, RBFN, PNN, CNN, SLP, MLP, MLNN, Reservoir computing, and Transformer models are performing excellently in their application to PR tasks. Therefore, the study recommends the research focus on current models and the development of new models concurrently for more successes in the field. © 2019 IEEE.","application to pattern recognition; Artificial neural networks; feedback neural networks; feedforward neural networks; hybrid models","Errors; Mean square error; Neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; Template matching; Hybrid model; Manufacturing industries; Mean absolute percentage error; Neural network application; Neural networks applications; Object classification; Root mean squared errors; Statistical indicators; Feedforward neural networks","","","","","United States Internal Revenue Segregated Fund of; Universiti Sains Malaysia; Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, HUSM, (1001/ PKOMP/ 8014017); Institute for the Study of Social Change, University of Tasmania, ISC","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the Universiti Sains Malaysia Research University (RUI), Malaysia, under Grant 1001/PKOMP/8014017, and in part by The Center for Cyber Safety and Education, United States Internal Revenue Segregated Fund of (ISC)2, Inc.

However, very limited causal knowledge based methods have been addressed to the problem of intrusion detection. In this paper, we propose an approach based on causal knowledge reasoning for anomaly intrusion detection. Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) are ideal causal knowledge acquiring tool with fuzzy signed graphs which can be presented as an associative single layer neural network. Using FCM, our methodology attempt to diagnose and direct network traffic data based on its relevance to attack or normal connections. By quantifying the causal inference process we can determine the attack detection and the severity of odd packets. As such packets with low causal relations to attacks can be dropped or ignored and/or packets with high causal relations to attacks are to be highlighted. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","False alerts; Fuzzy cognitive maps; Intrusion detection; Security","","","","","","","","Aguilar J., A dynamic fuzzy-cognitive-map approach based on random neural networks, International Journal of Computational Cognition, 1, 4, pp. 91-107, (2003); Alshammari R., Sonamthiang S., Teimouri M., Riordan D., Using neurofuzzy approach to reduce false positive alerts, Proceedings of Fifth Annual Conference on Communication Networks and Services Research (CNSR, pp. 345-349, (2007); Axelrod R., Structure of Decision: The Cognitive Maps of the Political Elites, (1976); Denning D.E., An intrusion model, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, SE-13, 2, pp. 222-232, (1987); Depren O., Topallar M., Anarim E., Kemal C.M., An intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) for anomaly and misuse detection in computer networks, Expert Systems with Applications, 29, pp. 713-722, (2005); Dickerson J.E., Juslin J., Koukousoula O., Dickerson J.A., Fuzzy intrusion detection, Proceedings of IFSA World Congress and 20th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society (NAFIPS) International Conference, (2001); Data.

Honey encryption (HE) was proposed as a countermeasure to this problem of cryptography. HE is an encryption scheme that supplies valid-looking, but fake plaintext for every incorrect key used by an intruder to decrypt a message. All possible messages relative to the original message are mapped to a seed space such that any key supplied by the attacker when decrypting a message produces a relative, but fake message from the original message and this makes it difficult for him to determine if he has recovered the original message or not. However, a challenging problem with HE is adapting it to natural language message to produce convincing fake messages for documents such as emails. We propose a novel approach of generating decoy message using Stanford Dependency Parser and Wordnet from Princeton. The result shows that the proposed scheme effectively produces convincing decoy messages that fools the attacker. In addition, the structure, length and content of the original message are concealed. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by checking the entropy of decoy messages from the plaintext. © 2018 Newswood Limited.

The novel Hybrid ABC/MBO (HAM) algorithm addresses the issues of trapping in local optimal solutions, slow convergence, and low precision by improving the balance be-tween the characteristics of exploration and exploitation. The proposed HAM al-gorithm is validated on eight benchmark functions, and is compared with ABC and MBO algorithms.

Additionally, the study presents ANN application challenges, contributions, compare performances and critiques methods. The study covers many applications of ANN techniques in various disciplines which include computing, science, engineering, medicine, environmental, agriculture, mining, technology, climate, business, arts, and nanotechnology, etc. The study assesses ANN contributions, compare performances and critiques methods. The study found that neural-network models such as feedforward and feedback propagation artificial neural networks are performing better in its application to human problems. Therefore, we proposed feedforward and feedback propagation ANN models for research focus based on data analysis factors like accuracy, processing speed, latency, fault tolerance, volume, scalability, convergence, and performance.

However, a challenging issue is that a network system can be easily controlled and compromised remotely using some tools like Armitage in Kali Linux, and using Eternal blue which developed by National security agency (NSA). Organized criminal gangs and Cyber Terrorism can use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) over SMB to manage a complete infrastructure in governments and organizations or encrypt the data as it happened by Run somewhere. Current researches on controlling the SMB remote code execution attack do not sufficiently address these issues. This Paper used MITRE (CAR) Model, (ATT&CK) Matrix, as a countermeasure to these attacks on windows. Also, we propose a new policy we made (we recommend Microsoft to do that with All Windows OS).

Simultaneously, malware authors also deployed some avoidance technique in order to avoid analysis and detection. Based on that situation, static code analysis is not always a possible solution to investigate and recognize malware characteristics. This paper presents an approach for identifying malware behaviors based on operation and target using dynamic analysis technique. This approach applies two ways of analysis which is run time analysis and resource monitoring. Run time analysis is malware oriented analysis to identify malware activities. Resource monitoring on the other hand monitors specific location of target attacks as host-oriented analysis. PE file of real malware samples were used in the implementation phase in order to present the workability of this approach. Experimental results demonstrate the malware behaviors result that defined based on malware operation and specific target attacks.","Dynamic analysis; Malware; Malware behavior; Resource monitoring; Run time analysis","Behavioral research; Dynamic analysis; Dynamic analysis techniques; Malware; Malware attacks; Malwares; Possible solutions; Resource monitoring; Run-time analysis; Specific location; Static code analysis; Computer crime","","","","","","","Min G.K., Heng Y., Hanna S., McCamant S., Song D., Emulating emulation-resistant malware, Proceedings of the 1st ACM Workshop on Virtual Machine Security, (2009); Bailey M., Andersen J., Morleymao Z., Jahanian F., Automated classification and analysis of internet malware, Proceedings of Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection RAID'07, Springer-Verlag, pp. 178-197, (2007); Xiao-Yong L., Wei-Wei L., Malicious code detection with integrated behavior analysis, Proceedings of International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 5, pp. 2797-2801, (2009); McGraw G., Morrisett, ""Attacking Malicious Code: A Report to The Infosec Research Council, Software IEEE, 17, 5, pp. 33-41, (2000); Aycock J., Computer Viruses and Malware, (2006); Sun Q., Wang Q., Ren J., Modeling and Analysis of the Proactive Worm In Unstructured Peer-to-Peer Network, Journal of Convergence Information Technology, 5, 5, (2010); Mell P., Kent K., Nusbaum J., Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling"", I.T.L.

The issue has been extensively addressed in uncountable researches and using various techniques, of which a commonly used technique is that based on detecting intrusions in contrast to normal network traffic and the classification of network packets as either normal or abnormal. However, the problem of improving the accuracy and efficiency of classification models remains open and yet to be resolved. This study proposes a new binary classification model for intrusion detection, based on hybridization of Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) and Dragonfly algorithm (DA) for training an artificial neural network (ANN) in order to increase the classification accuracy rate for malicious and non-malicious traffic in networks. At first the model selects the suitable biases and weights utilizing a hybrid (ABC) and (DA). Next, the neural network is retrained using these ideal values in order for the intrusion detection model to be able to recognize new attacks. Ten other metaheuristic algorithms were adapted to train the neural network and their performances were compared with that of the proposed model. In addition, four types of intrusion detection evaluation datasets were applied to evaluate the proposed model in comparison to the others. The results of our experiments have demonstrated a significant improvement in inefficient network intrusion detection over other classification methods. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC); dragonfly algorithm (DA); Intrusion detection system (IDS); metaheuristic algorithm (MA); multilayer perceptron (MLP)","Multilayer neural networks; Network security; Optimization; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Classification accuracy; Classification methods; Classification models; Intrusion detection models; Meta heuristic algorithm; Network intrusion detection; Intrusion detection","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8014017)","This work was supported in part by the Universiti Sains Malaysia under RUI Grant under Grant 1001/PKOMP/8014017.","Anderson J.P., Computer Security Threat Monitoring and Surveillance, (1980); Denning D.E., An intrusion-detection model, Ieee Trans.

In order to learn and understand the malwares, behavior-based technique that applied dynamic approach is the possible solution for identification, classification and clustering the malwares. In the paper, we present a new approach for conducting behavior-based analysis of malicious programs.

This inefficient configuration is unfortunately still the case in a lot of urban areas, where most of the traffic lights are based on a 'fixed cycle' protocol. To improve the traffic light configuration, this paper proposed monitoring system to be as an additional component (or additional subsystem) to the intelligent traffic light system, this component will be able to determine three street cases (empty street case, normal street case and crowded street case) by using small associative memory. The proposed monitoring system is working in two phases: training phase and recognition phase. The experiments presented promising results when the proposed approach was applied by using a program to monitor one intersection in Penang Island in Malaysia. The program could determine all street cases with different weather conditions depending on the stream of images, which are extracted from the streets video cameras. In addition, the observations which are pointed out to the proposed approach show a high flexibility to learn all the street cases using a few training images, thus the adaptation to any intersection can be done quickly.","Computer vision systems; Intelligent traffic light monitoring system; Neural network and associative memory; Vehicle detection","","","","","","","","Akanegawa M., Tanaka Y., Nakagawa M., Basic study on traffic information system using LED traffic lights, Intelligent Transportation Systems, IEEE Transactions on, 2, 4, pp. 197-203, (2001); Alejandro Lopez J., Garcia R., Garcia Blanco A., Zuniga Felix I.A., Traffic Lights Fuzzy Control Proposals to Improve Vehicular Flow, Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference, 2007, (2007); Alvarez I., Poznyak A., Malo A., Urban traffic control problem a game theory approach, Decision and Control, 2008, (2008); Turky A.M., Ahmad M.S., Yusoff M.Z.M., Sabar N.R., Genetic Algorithm Application for Traffic Light Control, Information Systems: Modeling, Development, and Integration book, 20, (2009); Chao K.-H., Lee R.-H., Wang M.-H., An Intelligent Traffic Light Control Based on Extension Neural Network, Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems, (2009); de la Escalera A., Armingol J.M., Mata M., Traffic sign recognition and analysis for intelligent vehicles, Image and Vision Computing, 21, 3, pp. 247-258, (2003); De Schutter B., Optimal traffic light control for a single intersection, American Control Conference, 1999.

The model investigates user traffic, including that injected through distributed gateways and that destined to gateways that are experiencing actual attacks. Misbehaving traffic filtration is triggered only when the network is congested, at which point burst gateways generate an explicit congestion notification (ECN) to misbehaving users. To investigate the behavior of misbehaving user traffic, packet delay variation (PDV) ratios are actively estimated and packet transfer rates are passively measured at a unit time. Users who exceed the PDV bit rates specified in their service level agreements (SLAs) are filtered as suspicious users. In addition, suspicious users who exceed the SLA bandwidth bit rates are filtered as network intruders. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently filters network traffic and precisely detects malicious traffic. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
