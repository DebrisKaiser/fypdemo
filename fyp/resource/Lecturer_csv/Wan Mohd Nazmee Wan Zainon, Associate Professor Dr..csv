Software design is a demanding task that requires lot of experience, expertise and knowledge of many different types of design alternatives. Each software engineers acquires more specific knowledge as he/she participate in a new project. Experienced engineers are very vital asset to Software Company, especially in a high competitive market environment; as such reusing knowledge of experienced engineers can save a lot of cost and time to the software company. UML models are de facto modelling language used by many software engineers during the software design stage, its receiving a widespread attention in the field of software reuse. It’s not surprising, because of the benefits that can be reaped out during the reuse of early software design is numerous, and it can lead to reuse of all related work-products. There is considerable amount of works that takes place within the scope of UML models reuse, this paper presents an experimental results of different features of UML models that are used during the matching and retrieval of UML diagrams from repository. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Reuse; Similarity; Software properties; UML models","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (203/ PKOMP/6711533)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia, under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS: 203/ PKOMP/6711533).","Frakes W.B., Kyo K., Software reuse research: Status and future, Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions On, 31, 7, pp. 529-536, (2005); Al-Badareen A.B., Et al., Reusable software components framework, European Conference of Computer Science (ECCS 2011), (2010); Salami H.O., Ahmed M.A., UML artifacts reuse: State of the art, Arxiv Preprint Arxiv, 1402, (2014); Kotonya G., Lock S., Mariani J., Scrapheap software development: Lessons from an experiment on opportunistic reuse, IEEE Software, 28, 2, pp. 68-74, (2011); Kulkarni N., Systematically selecting a software module during opportunistic reuse, Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Software Engineering, (2013); Keswani R., Joshi S., Jatain A., Software Reuse in Practice.

In today’s world, magnetic resonance imaging is used for determining the brain tumor types in an effective manner. The manual classification of brain tumor consumes more time and also applicable for a limited number of images, so a deep learning-based model is proposed in this research paper for automatic classification of brain tumor types. At first, the brain images are collected from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image dataset. Then, the normalization technique and histogram of oriented gradients are employed to improve the visible level of the collected raw brain images and to extract the feature vectors from the normalized brain images. The histogram descriptor effectively describes the edge and contour features of the images related to other feature descriptors. Further, the extracted features are given as the input to convolutional neural networks to classify meningiomas, gliomas, and pituitary tumors. The hard swish-based RELU activation function is included in convolutional neural networks that effectively improve the classification performance and learning speed. In the experimental phase, the proposed model achieved 98.6% of accuracy that is better compared to the existing algorithms like deep convolutional neural network with transfer learning and fine-tuning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","A histogram of oriented gradients;

As these reactions are valuable indicators for social and political well beings, we are motivated to automate the classification of news texts based on these indicators, e.g. happy, sad, angry, amused etc. Unlike other review texts that contain more explicit words which can be interpreted directly for sentiment classification, news texts mostly report facts and figures. This resulted in needs to identify whether contents of news can be exploited for classification or otherwise. Hence, in this work, a study is conducted to analyze and determine the relevant key parts of news contents that can be to be used for sentiment-based classification. Two criteria, i.e. text Part of Speech and text position, which could possible influence the training of the classifier are studied. Evaluations are conducted on the collection of 250 English news texts labelled with sentiments from sentiment voting system. The results for sentiment-based category has recorded F score of 0.422 whereas for polarity-based category has recorded F score of 0.837. The study has shown that when finer categories (e.g. happy, sad etc.) are used, the inspected criteria are less effectively; however, when these categories are based on polarity orientations, the outcomes show potentials of the proposed criteria especially for text positioned at headlines and text using adjective words. © 2018 The Authors.","News Sentiment; Text Analysis; Text Classification","Classification (of information); Information systems; Tellurium compounds; Voting machines; News content; News Sentiment; Part Of Speech; Sentiment classification; Sentiment-based classification; Text analysis; Text classification; Voting systems; Text processing","","","","","USM Research University, (1001/PKOMP/811335); Universiti Sains Malaysia","This research was supported by USM Research University Grant (1001/PKOMP/811335: Mining Unstructured Web Data For Tour Itineraries Construction), Universiti Sains Malaysia.","Dillon A., McKnight C., Towards a classification of text types: A repertory grid approach, Int.

Thus, the extraction of valuable knowledge, and making scientific decisions for the treatment of disease, has progressively become necessary to attain effective diagnosis. The obtainability of a large amount of medical data leads to the requirement of effective data analysis tools for extracting constructive knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method for heart disease diagnosis. Here, the pre-processing of medical data is done using log-transformation that converts the data to its uniform value range. Then, the feature selection process is performed using sparse fuzzy-c-means (FCM) for selecting significant features to classify medical data. Incorporating sparse FCM for the feature selection process provides more benefits for interpreting the models, as this sparse technique provides important features for detection, and can be utilized for handling high dimensional data. Then, the selected features are given to the deep belief network (DBN), which is trained using the proposed Taylor-based bird swarm algorithm (Taylor-BSA) for detection. Here, the proposed Taylor-BSA is designed by combining the Taylor series and bird swarm algorithm (BSA). The proposed Taylor-BSA-DBN outperformed other methods, with maximal accuracy of 93.4%, maximal sensitivity of 95%, and maximal specificity of 90.3%, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the need for such systems goes further than just the need to convert a scanned document into a text file. There is also a need to produce a more appealing and refine reconstructed fonts. Recently, many research works in font reconstruction have shown successful and encouraging results. However, the usual way of evaluating the performance of font reconstruction is through visual inspection which is very subjective in nature, and arduous for a more perfect and objective evaluation. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to present a framework for an objective performance evaluation method that can be used to compare a reconstructed font with its original counterpart. Thus, it will involve studying the nature of the current and existing digital fonts and then formulate a method to compare character glyph of the created font with its corresponding original font. From this framework, it is expected that font reconstruction would be made more refine and the evaluation can be made more objective and less arduous than using the human eye, and old and rare documents can be more readily available for users in digital format with better precision in particular on tablets and other resource-constrained devices. © 2016 IEEE.","character classification; digital font reconstruction; optical character recognition","Character recognition; Optical character recognition; Character classification; Digital format; Human eye; Objective evaluation; Optical character recognition (OCR); Resourceconstrained devices; Text file; Visual inspection; Digital devices","","","","","","","Cutter M.P., Van Beusekom J., Shafait F., Breuel T.M., Unsupervised font reconstruction based on token co-occurrence, Proceedings of the 10th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering DocEng'10, pp. 143-150, (2010); Cutter M.P., Van Beusekom J., Shafait F., Breuel T.M., Font group identification using reconstructed fonts, DRR of SPIE Proceedings, SPIE, 7874, pp. 1-10, (2011); Open Source Document Analysis and Ocr System; Better Pdf Ocr.

Nevertheless such websites are sometimes not updated, do not provide required information or the worst case they are abandoned despite the fact that software developers have fulfilled the requirements of the users, and the systems have been deployed successfully. Hence, such websites require a dynamic web design that can delegate responsibility to each staff in ensuring the contents are always updated either to be shared among the staff or the public. This paper proposes an approach called EPISoDe that directly integrates organisations' policies as part of functional requirements in software development in this case we focus on website design and its implementation of higher learning institutions. We have deployed the proposed EPISoDe approach in a prototype called DyWeMS that provides an engine of a dynamic web design. We evaluated the approach on an official website of a school in a higher learning institution using DyWeMS dynamic engine. It implies that an organisational official website has the potential to be a one-stop information and knowledge centre that reflects organisations' history and legacy using the proposed EPISoDe approach that promotes delegation of responsibilities among the staff with the support of dynamic web design. © 2011 IEEE.","Dynamic Web Design; Official Websites; Organisations' Policy; Software Development","Computer science; Computer software; Design; Gateways (computer networks); Information science; Societies and institutions; User interfaces; Websites; Functional requirement; Higher learning; Integrated approach; Official Websites; One stop; Organisations' Policy; Software developer; Web designs; Web site design; Worst case; Software design","","","","","","","Sulaiman S., Yusof U.K., Sulaiman S., A method to integrate Organisations' policies into web design, The Fourth Malaysian Software Engineering Conference (MySEC'08), pp. 307-312, (2008); He Q., Otto P., Anton A.I., Jones L., Ensuring compliance between policies, requirements and software design: A case study, Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Information Assurance (IWIA'06), (2006); Ong C.-S., Lai J.-Y., Wang Y.-M., Wang S.-W., An understanding of power issues influencing employees' acceptance of KMS: An empirical study of Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing companies, Proceedings of the 38th Annual Hawaii International Conference (HICSS'05), pp. 1-10, (2005); Hall H., Input-friendliness: Motivating knowledge sharing across intranets, Journal of Information Science, 27, 3, pp. 139-146, (2001); Hall H., Goody M., KM, culture and compromise: Interventions to promote knowledge sharing supported by technology in corporate environments, Journal of Information Science, 33, 2, pp. 181-188, (2007); Gillies J.S., Cultural obstacles to a successful KM initiative in large law firms, KMWorld & Intranets 2005 Conferences & Exposition, (2005); Moore J.W., The Road Map to Software Engineering: A Standardsbased Guide; Webometrics; Mambo CMS Latest Release; Joomla CMS","S.

Hate speech problem is normally model as a text classification task. In this study, we examined the basic baseline components of hate speech classification using ML algorithms. There are five basic baseline components - data collection and exploration, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, classifier selection and training, and model evaluation, were reviewed. There have been improvements in ML algorithms that were employed for hate speech detection over time. New datasets and different performance metrics have been proposed in the literature. To keep the researchers informed regarding these trends in the automatic detection of hate speech, it calls for a comprehensive and an updated state-of-the-art. The contributions of this study are three-fold. First to equip the readers with the necessary information on the critical steps involved in hate speech detection using ML algorithms. Secondly, the weaknesses and strengths of each method is critically evaluated to guide researchers in the algorithm choice dilemma. Lastly, some research gaps and open challenges were identified. The different variants of ML techniques were reviewed which include classical ML, ensemble approach and deep learning methods. Researchers and professionals alike will benefit immensely from this study.  © 2013 IEEE.","Cyber hate; Deep learning; Ensemble technique; Machine learning; Social media networks; Text classification","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Social networking (online); Speech recognition; Text processing; Cybe hate; Deep learning; Ensemble techniques; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning techniques; Social media; Social media networks; Speech classification; Speech detection; Text classification; Speech","","","","","","","Albarrak M.S., Elnahass M., Papagiannidis S., Salama A., The effect of Twitter dissemination on cost of equity: A big data approach, Int.

Visualization is used to analyse the whole development process with a graphical notation to show the life of each requirement and help to deliver a quality software system that meet stakeholders’ expectations. Due to limitations of existing requirement traceability visualization tools and techniques, their practical use is not widely in use. This paper presents a review study on tools and techniques for software requirement traceability visualization with summary and comparison to reveal their scalability and visual clutter issues.

Various medical data classification methods are developed in the existing research works, but to achieve higher performance in terms of classification accuracy result in a great challenge in the medical sector due to the presence of missing values, uncertainty and redundant attributes. Hence, an effective and optimal data classification method named Atom Taylor Bird Swarm Algorithm-based Deep Belief Network (Atom Taylor BSA-based DBN) is proposed in this research to perform incremental classification using medical data. The proposed Atom Taylor BSA is designed by integrating the atom search optimization (ASO) with the Taylor Bird Swarm algorithm (Taylor BSA), which is the development of the Taylor series with BSA. The DBN classifier effectively performs the incremental classification using medical data with its associated neurons and generates optimal result based on the fitness measure. Accordingly, the selected features enable the classifier to increase the performance of classification accuracy. However, the proposed Atom Taylor BSA-based DBN obtained better performance using the metrics, like specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy with the values of 0.8307, 0.9074, and 0.8804, using Hungarian dataset. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Atom search optimization (ASO);

The majority of current studies on this task focus on mapping the image and the text to a high-dimensional space in order to obtain and fuse implicit representations, ignoring the rich semantic information contained in the images and not taking into account the contribution of the visual modality in the multimodal fusion representation, which can potentially influence the results of TMSC tasks. This paper proposes a general model for Improving Targeted Multimodal Sentiment Classification with Semantic Description of Images (ITMSC) as a way to tackle these issues and improve the accuracy of multimodal sentiment analysis. Specifically, the ITMSC model can automatically adjust the contribution of images in the fusion representation through the exploitation of semantic descriptions of images and text similarity relations. Further, we propose a target-based attention module to capture the target-text relevance, an image-based attention module to capture the image-text relevance, and a target-image matching module based on the former two modules to properly align the target with the image so that fine-grained semantic information can be extracted. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves comparable performance with several state-of-the-art approaches on two multimodal sentiment datasets. Our findings indicate that incorporating semantic descriptions of images can enhance our understanding of multimodal content and lead to improved sentiment analysis performance. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Although the issue has been discussed over 20 years, there is no guideline in identifying the important dimension of data quality being proposed to adhere with the context of Big Data. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to review literature on the issue, challenges, and dimension of data quality in the era of Big Data using thematic review. This review included journal and conference proceeding papers from ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and Science Direct published between 2016 until 2020. Inclusion and exclusion processes have filtered out 21 final articles for the review. A systematic review on these 21 articles focuses on the issue, challenges, and dimension of data quality. The results of this study benefit the future study on the development of data quality dimensions and can be a guideline for the researcher to design the data quality assessment framework. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","ATLAS.ti 8; Big data; Data quality; Data quality dimensions; Systematic review","Data reduction; Digital libraries; ATLAS.; Data quality; Data quality dimensions; Improper maintenance; Measurement process; Precise measurements; Quality challenges; Quality dimension; Systematic Review; Ti 8; Big data","","","","","","","Swapnil W., Anil Y., Gupta S., Big data: Characteristics, challenges and data mining, Int J Comput Appl, pp. 25-29, (2016); Ridzuan F., Wan Zainon W.M.N., A review on data cleansing methods for big data, Proc Comput Sci, 161, pp. 731-738, (2019); Taleb I., Dssouli R., Serhani M.A., Big Data pre-processing: A quality framework, 2015 IEEE International Congress on Big Data.

The Somali language is officially written with the Latin alphabet. Before 1990, the Somali language was the main instruction of the educational institutions in Somalia. However, after the collapse of the Somali central government, foreign languages such as Arabic and English have been taking over as the languages of instruction in Somali educational institutions such as schools and universities. It is feared that the language may die out in about 50 years. One reason for this is a lack of computer tools such as word processors with spell checkers which may promote the use of Somali language. The absence of a spell checker in Somali may lead to spelling mistakes in Somali written documents, including social media posts and friendly chats. The focus of this paper is to propose a spell checker for Somali Language using Knuth-Morris-Pratt String Matching Algorithm with Corpus. A spell checker for the Somali language will provide a word processing interface for writing documents that identifies a misspelled word, underlines it, and suggests the proper spelling of the typed word, if any. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Corpus; Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm; Somali language; Spell checker","Soft computing; Central government; Corpus; Educational institutions; National language; Official languages; Somali language; Spell checker; Written documents; Word processing","","","","","","","Orwin M., Somalia: Language situation A2, Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, pp. 509-510, (2006); Hashi A., Developing a model corpus for endangered languages, Graduate Thesis, University of Calgary, (2014); Patrick D., Language endangerment, language rights and indigeneity, Bilingualism: A Social Approach, pp. 111-134, (2007); Soleh M.Y., Purwarianti A., A non-word error spell checker for Indonesian using morphologically analyzer and HMM, International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI), (2011); Mon A.M., Spell checker for Myanmar language, International Conference on Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management (CAMP), (2012); Mandal P., Hossain B.M., Clustering-based Bangla spell checker, IEEE International Conference on Imaging, Vision and Pattern Recognition (Icivpr), (2017); Basri S.B., Alfred R., On C.K., Automatic spell checker for Malay blog, IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE), (2012); Kamayani M., Renainda R., Simbolon S., Application of document spelling checker for Bahasa Indonesia, International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information System (ICACSIS), (2011); Nonghuloo M.S., Krishnamurthi K., Spell checker for Khasi language, Int.

This is because of the inconsistencies between software properties. Matching is a fundamental operation for UML model reuse, as such accurate matching between models’ elements results in better reuse of such models. UML models consist of number of properties such as functional properties, structural properties, and behavioral properties. Such properties are source of numerous errors during software matching, because each property represents software system from different views. In this paper we empirically investigate the use of different weight values when computing the similarity of software system from multiple views. The paper investigates the improvement of similarity values through the calibration of aggregated metrics. The result reported shows the superiority of structural properties if assign higher metric value compared to other properties. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Class diagrams; Matching; Metrics;

This paper investigates the use of feature selection, dimensionality reduction and classification techniques to predict and diagnose chronic disease. The appropriate selection of attributes plays a crucial role in improving the classification accuracy of the diagnosis systems. Additionally, dimensionality reduction techniques effectively improve the overall performance of the machine learning algorithms. On chronic disease databases, the classification techniques deliver efficient predictive results by developing intelligent, adaptive and automated system. Parallel and adaptive classification techniques are also analyzed in chronic disease diagnosis which is used to stimulate the classification procedure and to improve the computational cost and time. This survey article represents the overview of feature selection, dimensionality reduction and classification techniques and their inherent benefits and drawbacks.  © 2013 IEEE.","Adaptive classification; chronic disease; dimensionality reduction; feature selection; parallel classification","Automation; Computer aided diagnosis; Dimensionality reduction; Diseases; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Adaptive classification; Automated systems; Classification accuracy; Classification procedure; Classification technique; Computational costs; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Selection of attributes; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Zhang X., Zhao H., Zhang S., Li R., A novel deep neural network model for multi-label chronic disease prediction, Frontiers Genet, 10, (2019); Rajeswari K., Vaithiyanathan V., Pede S.V., Feature selection for classification in medical data mining, Int.

Family trees contain a lot of potential information to be explored especially for research purposes. However, many family trees fail to properly encode all necessary and useful information. Genogram therefore seems to be the most suitable visual representation of medical family tree data as it contains complex information that can be clearly presented in a diagram using genogram symbols and color-coded lines. Some limitations are problems in visualizing the wealth and complexity of the information represented once a family tree gets bigger. Hence, a new framework for exploring medical family tree data is proposed in this paper. By using genogram as a tool and a few selected visualization techniques as an enhancement in designing these new framework, which will allows users to maximize usage of data by exploring the data from several different viewpoints. This framework follows the design of advanced graphical user interface guide which is the Visual Information-Seeking Mantra “Overview first, Zoom and Filter, then Details-on Demand”, proposed by Shneiderman in 1996. Using this framework (visualization tool), it is also possible to predict health risk factors based on medical family tree data. This visualization tool can be utilized for personal use or by healthcare professionals. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Genogram; Medical family tree data; Visualization techniques","Design; Forestry; Graphical user interfaces; Health risks; Information science; Information use; User interfaces; Visualization; Complex information; Family tree; Genogram; Health care professionals; Visual information seeking; Visual representations; Visualization technique; Visualization tools; Data visualization","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/817071)","We thank Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for providing the funding (Research University (RUI) Grant - no: 1001/PKOMP/817071) through which this article was produced.","McGoldrick M., Gerson R., Petry S.S., Genograms: Assessment and Intervention, (2008); Kennedy V., Genograms.

Matrix multiplication is under the list of time-consuming problems that require s huge computational resources to improve its speedup. As many studies have shown, it is not easy to achieve high performance speedup in sequential matrix multiplication algorithm using larger input. The emphasis of this study is to propose a parallel algorithm to calculate the product of two square matrices with improved speedup performance compared to the sequential and OpenMP algorithms. In this research, biruni (super machine workstation) in the School of Computer Sciences, USM, Malaysia with General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GP-GU) was used to parallelize the matrix product algorithm. A comparison between parallel OpenMp versions and sequential algorithm with the proposed CUDA based algorithm of this research was carried out to evaluate the speedup performance of the proposed parallel CUDA based algorithm. The overall results show that CUDA based parallel matrix multiplication is approximately 400 times faster than sequential matrix multiplication and 4 times faster than OpenMp matrix multiplication algorithms, respectively. Therefore, the proposed parallel algorithm can help the researchers working with matrix multiplication application problems. It can also help mathematicians to easily calculate the product of any two matrices and obtain the result in a shorter time. © 2019 The Authors.","C language; CUDA; GPGU; Matrix multiplication; Parallelization","Application programming interfaces (API); C (programming language); Computer graphics; Computer workstations; Graphics processing unit; Information systems; Information use; Parallel algorithms; Problem oriented languages; Program processors; C language; CUDA; GPGU; MAtrix multiplication; Parallelizations; Matrix algebra","","","","","","","Yegnanarayanan V., An application of matrix multiplication, Resonance, 18, pp. 368-377, (2013); Krishnan K., Nieplocha J., Optimizing parallel multiplication operation for rectangular and transposed matrices, Proceedings, Tenth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems, ICPADS 2004, pp. 257-266, (2004); Sotiropoulos I., Papaefstathiou I., A fast parallel matrix multiplication reconfigurable unit utilized in face recognitions systems, International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Application, pp. 276-281, (2009); Idris M., Idna Y., Noor N.M., Tamil E.Md., Razak Z., Arof H., Parallel matrix multiplication design for monocular SLAM, Fourth Asia International Conference on Mathematical/Analytical Modelling and Computer Simulation (AMS), pp. 492-497, (2010); Zheng J.-H., Zhang L.-J., Zhu R., Ning K., Liu D., Parallel matrix multiplication algorithm based on vector linear combination using MapReduce, IEEE Ninth World Congress on Services (SERVICES), pp. 193-200, (2013); Kim M., Jang Y.J., Ro W.W., Parallel transpose of matrix multiplication based on the tiling algorithms, IEEE 54th International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS), pp. 1-3, (2011); Li H.L., Fox G., Qiu J., Performance model for parallel matrix multiplication with dryad: Dataflow graph runtime, Second International Conference on Cloud and Green Computing 2012 (CGC2012), pp. 675-683, (2012); Excel Matrix Multiplication - Replacing MMULT with Power Query, (2017); Weisstein E., Matrix Multiplication, (2017); Deng J., Application of matrix in computer science and technology, Applied Mechanics & Materials, (2014); Piedra R.M., A parallel approach for matrix multiplication on the TMS320C4X Dsp, Texas Instruments SPRA107, pp. 1-24, (1994); Murni A.B., Ernastuti T.H., Kerami D., Hypergraph Partitioning Implementation for Parallelizing Matrix-Vector Multiplication Using CUDA GPU-based Parallel Computing, AIP Conference Proceedings, (2017); Nagasaka Y., Nukada A., Matsuoka S., High-performance and memory-saving sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication for NVIDIA Pascal GPU, 46th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP2017), pp. 101-110, (2017); Bell N., Garland M., Efficient sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication on CUDA, NVIDIA Technical Report NVR-2008-004, (2008); Hochberg R., Matrix Multiplication with CUDA-A Basic Introduction to the CUDA Programming Model, (2012)","W.M.N.

It refers to the development of software by reusing components previous software development. Reusing components during the development of software reduces time and cost which could also enhance reliability and quality of the concept of reuse. In this paper, a software reuse model is established where it shows the overall process of retrieving the relevant use cases. A database is built and a prototype is developed based on the model. Levenshtein Distance algorithm is applied in computing the similarity score. A list of relevant use cases is displayed as a result. Evaluation criteria such as recall and precision are used to evaluate the result. Based on the results, the enhancement of the software reuse model has been proposed. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Software requirements; Software reuse; Use case diagram","","","","","","","","Prieto-Diaz R., Status Report: Software Reusability, IEEE, 10, pp. 61-66, (1993); Smolarova M., Navrat P., Software Reuse: Principles, Patterns, and Prospects, Journal of Computing and Information Technology, 5, 1, pp. 33-48, (1997); Hislop G.W., Evaluating a Software Reuse Tool.

The key issue in testing is determining the sufficiency of tests and, traditionally this has been done by using the Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs). However, SRGMs are not applicable when there are no stabilization phases as required by most software reliability models. Test-Defect Coverage Analytics Model (TDCAM) has been proposed to address this problem. This paper proposes the application of visual analytic techniques as an approach for supporting informed decision making in deciding the sufficiency of tests. Visual analytics research considers interactive visualization as the common platform for combining various computational data analysis techniques to support the analytical reasoning process. We presented four visual representations of TDCAM to demonstrate how analytical models have been applied to indicate the adequacy of tests in relation to sufficient and efficient test coverage. The techniques provide an effective and generally applicable test estimation on the basis of a general trend that higher test coverage correlates with higher probability of detecting more defects. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Software reliability; Software testing; Software visualization; Test analytics; Visual analytics","Application programs; Data visualization; Decision making; Software reliability; Testing; Visualization; Analytic technique; Analytical reasoning; Interactive visualizations; Software reliability growth models; Software reliability models; Software visualization; Visual analytics; Visual representations; Software testing","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (304.PKOMP.6316282)","The authors would like to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia Bridging Research Grant Scheme (304.PKOMP.6316282) for the financial support.

However, conventional approaches that rely on unimodal pre-trained models for feature extraction from each modality often overlook the intrinsic connections of semantic information between modalities. This limitation is attributed to their training on unimodal data, and necessitates the use of complex fusion mechanisms for sentiment analysis. In this study, we present a novel approach that combines a vision-language pre-trained model with a proposed multimodal contrastive learning method. Our approach harnesses the power of transfer learning by utilizing a vision-language pre-trained model to extract both visual and textual representations in a unified framework. We employ a Transformer architecture to integrate these representations, thereby enabling the capture of rich semantic information in image-text pairs. To further enhance the representation learning of these pairs, we introduce our proposed multimodal contrastive learning method, which leads to improved performance in sentiment analysis tasks. Our approach is evaluated through extensive experiments on two publicly accessible datasets, where we demonstrate its effectiveness. We achieve a significant improvement in sentiment analysis accuracy, indicating the supe-riority of our approach over existing techniques. These results highlight the potential of multimodal sentiment analysis and underscore the importance of considering the intrinsic semantic connections between modalities for accurate sentiment assessment. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

They are typically used as tree structure node-link diagram. However, it is difficult to visualize the content of directories when there are too many child nodes. In this paper, a study on the effectiveness of the tree-maps as tree structure visualization will be presented. Tree-maps are always considered as one of the interesting topic of research in HCI. Therefore, in this paper we will discuss about applying various types of Tree-maps as one of the visualization techniques. First, we will look into current problem faced by Tree structured node-link diagram. We will also look into four main types of tree-maps such as original tree-maps, Circular Tree-maps, Cushion Tree-maps and 3D Tree-maps. Finally, the effectiveness of these tree-maps to visualize the hierarchy of the directory will be investigated by conducting a simple user experiments. © 2018 The Authors.","3D Tree-Maps; Circular Tree-Maps; Cushion Tree-Maps; Tree Structure Visualization; Tree-Maps","Data visualization; Information systems; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; 3D tree; Current problems; Hierarchical structures; Node-link diagrams; Tree structures; Tree visualization; Tree-maps; Visualization technique; Forestry","","","","","UIR; Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (1001/PKOMP/8012206)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under UIR Grant; Funding text 2: This work was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under RUI Grant Scheme (1001/PKOMP/8012206).","Johnson B., Shneiderman B., Tree-maps: A Space-Filling Approach to the Visualization of Hierarchical Information Structures.

In particular, the emphasis is on visualizing the similarities and differences between pairs of trees. The impetus for the work comes from the field of bioinformatics, where biologists construct complex phylogenetic trees to represent the evolution of species or genes. The two main issues that arise when comparing these data is to know how to efficiently and effectively compare phylogenetic trees, and how to visually present the results of the comparison. The primary approach is to present a new framework for tree structure visualization techniques that will display pairs of trees ""face to face"" with leaf nodes aligned. The results show that a combination of automatic and manual rearrangement is often effective in rapidly generating an arrangement that facilitates tree comparison, even for quite large trees. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Bioinformatics; Phylogenetic tree visualization; Visual comparison","Data visualization; Trees (mathematics); Face to face; Phylogenetic trees; Tree comparison; Tree structures; Tree-structured data; Visual comparison; Visualization technique; Bioinformatics","","","","","","","Hall B.G., Phylogenetic Trees Made Easy: A How-To Manual, (2007); Munzner T., Guimbretiere F., Tasiran S., Zhang L., Zhou Y., TreeJuxtaposer: Scalable tree comparison using focus+context with guaranteed visibility, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 22, 3, pp. 453-462, (2003); Shneiderman B., Tree visualization with tree-maps: A 2-D space-filling approach, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 11, 1, pp. 92-99, (1992); Lamping J., Rao R., The hyperbolic browser: A focus + context technique for visualizing large hierarchies, Journal of Visual Languages and Computing, 7, 1, pp. 33-55, (1995); Schulz H.J., Schumann H., Hadlak S., Pointbased tree representation-a new approach for large hierarchies, Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium, pp. 81-88, (2009); Stover B., Muller K., TreeGraph 2: Combining and visualizing evidence from different phylogenetic analyses, BMC Bioinformatics, 11, 7, pp. 7-16, (2010); Wan Z.W.M.N., Talib A.Z., Belaton B., A New Framework for Phylogenetic Tree Visualization, pp. 348-359, (2011)","W.

This is further compounded by the availability of myriad of choices for the user to choose from in terms of which network to connect to. Furthermore, in 4G environment, mobility scenarios are highly dynamic and current approaches tends to ignore this. Additionally, these solutions tend to focus on solving one aspect of the NSP. This paper proposes a holistic and dynamic network selection solution based on gray relational analysis (GRA) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). In order to correctly assess the context on which the network selection occurs, our method uses attributes collected from the three main stakeholders of a NSP mainly: user, mobile node and the candidate networks. Depending on the type attribute, the proposed method uses a combined method of mean value of past sessions as well as most recent value as means to collect the attribute value. This is so that past as well as current scenario is taken into consideration. Weights are assigned to these attributes indicating their relative importance. Previous approaches mostly uses quality of service requirements (QOS) of the executing application as a guide for indicating the weight. The proposed scheme not only uses QOS requirements but also combines user preference and mobile node's mobility scenario into consideration in determining the weights.

It was accepted as a standard modeling language for visualizing, specifying and documenting software systems by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as a standard specification. It contained different type of diagrams for specifying software system, among these diagrams is sequence diagrams which is used to specify the functional behavior of software system. The growing complexity of software systems is one of the motivation behind matching of UML diagrams in order to pave the way of reusing existing software to developed new software systems. Previous works on sequence diagrams matching are based on Graph representation in which there is node whenever there is message sending or received. However, the search space for these approach is very large due to the number of nodes in the graph which makes the matching computationally expensive. This paper employed the use of Dynamic Programming approach in order to improve the efficiency of matching between two or more sequence diagrams. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Model reuse; Similarity assessment; UML matching","Computer software; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Modeling languages; Unified Modeling Language; Graph representation; International organization for standardizations; Model re-use; Requirement engineering; Similarity assessment; Standard specifications; UML matching; UML sequence diagrams; Dynamic programming","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (203/PKOMP/6711533)","Acknowledgements.

On that note, cyber-hate has become an increasing concern for most countries, especially those that are practising democracy. Studies on the influence of social media (SM) on political discourse have now become an important research area due to the rising trends of SM politics. It becomes necessary to address this problem using automated social intelligence. To tackle this concern, the researchers built a novel heterogeneous stacked ensemble (HSE) classifier for detecting politically motivated cyber-hate on Twitter. We constructed a heterogeneous stacked ensemble with eight baseline estimators. In the proposed methodology, the researchers employed TF-IDF for feature vectorisation. The researchers used Twitter API for data scraping to harvest tweets during a gubernatorial election in Nigeria for the training and evaluation of the stacked ensemble model. A total of 15,502 tweets were collected and after some preliminary cleaning, 5876 tweets were manually labelled as hate (1) or non-hate (0). The coded tweets contain 16.87% hate and 83.13% non-hate tweets. This article has three contributions – a critical review of literature on the detection of politically motivated cyber-hate, the building of a new dataset and the proposed stacked ensemble method. Two other public datasets (Kaggle and HASOC) were used to test the performance of our method. The F1-score metric was employed for comparison. Our method is better by 12% on the Kaggle and 4% on the HASOC datasets. We are working on more data for deep learning experiments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Hate speech; Machine learning; Political discourse; Social media platforms; Stacking ensemble; Text categorization","Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Text processing; Detection accuracy; Ensemble approaches; Hate speech; Machine-learning; Political discourse; Social media; Social media platforms; Stacking ensemble; Stackings; Text categorization; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Adum A.N., Ojiakor O.E., Nnatu S., Party Politics, Hate Speech and the Media: A Developing Society Perspective, 5, 1, pp. 2019-2045; Aggrawal N., Detection of Offensive Tweets: A, Comparative Study Niyati, 1, 1, pp. 1-26, (2018); Birch S., Daxecker U., Hoglund K., Electoral violence: An introduction, J Peace Res, 57, 1, pp. 3-14, (2020); Breiman L., Bagging Predictors, Mach Learn, 24, 421, pp. 123-140, (1996); Brownlee J., Statistical Methods for Machine Learning Discover How to Transform Data into Knowledge with Python, (2019); Burnap P., Williams M.L., Us and them: Identifying cyber hate on Twitter across multiple protected characteristics, EPJ Data Science, 5, 1, pp. 1-15, (2016); Chauhan P., Sharma N., Sikka, The emergence of social media data and sentiment analysis in election prediction, J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput, 12, 2, pp. 2601-2627, (2021); Davidson T., Warmsley D., Macy M., Weber I., Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language, Proceedings of the 11Th International Conference on Web and Social Media, ICWSM, 2017, pp. 512-515, (2017); Divina F., Gilson A., Gomez-Vela F., Torres M.G., Torres J.F., Stacking ensemble learning for short-term electricity consumption forecasting, Energies, 11, 4, pp. 1-31, (2018); Dou J., Yunus A.P., Bui D.T., Merghadi A., Sahana M., Zhu Z., Chen C.W., Han Z., Pham B.T., Improved landslide assessment using support vector machine with bagging, boosting, and stacking ensemble machine learning framework in a mountainous watershed, Japan Landslides, 17, 3, pp. 641-658, (2020); Ezeibe C.C., Hate Speech and Electoral Violence in Nigeria, Hhate Speech and Electoral Violence in Nigeria, 2015, pp. 1-35, (2015); Fatemifar S., Awais M., Akbari A., Kittler J., A Stacking Ensemble for Anomaly Based Client-Specific Face Spoofing Detection.

Some of these diseases may be genetic in nature. By exploring a Medical Family Tree we can become more aware of any genetic factors that may put us at risk of developing genetically-linked diseases. The main purpose of this paper is to present a proposal on a study to explore the medical family data using visual data mining techniques. This article seeks to enable reader to basically understand how and why this type of research is being conducted and how it can be used to help medical practitioners in understanding family health and condition based on information gathered for family medical tree. Initial investigation suggest that visual data mining has huge potentials as it can visually help a lot people such as health practitioners, therapist, clinicians, social workers and others in various fields to understand the patient's family medical history and to look for recurring patterns of illness and behaviour. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.","medical family tree; visual data mining; visual data representation","Data Processing; Forestry; Forestry; Information science; Family tree; Genetic factors; Medical history; Medical practitioner; Social workers; Visual data mining; Visual data representation; Data mining","","","","","","","Gill S.S., Evolutionary Computing for Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment, (2003); Kimball R., Mer R., The Data Webhouse Toolkit: Building the Web-Enabled Data Warehouse, (2000); Fayyad U.M., Piatetsky-Shapiro G., Smyth P., From data mining to knowledge discovery: An overview, Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1-34, (1996); Mitchell T.M., Machine Learning, (1997); Friedman J., Hastie T., Tibshirani R., The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference and Prediction, (2009); Berthold M.R., Dill F., Kotter T., Thiel K., Supporting creativity: Towards associative discovery of new insights, LNCS (LNAI), 5012, pp. 14-25, (2008); Fry B., Visualizing Data: Exploring and Explaining Data with the Processing Environment, (2007); Kohavi R., Data Mining and Visualization, Sixth Annual Symposium on Frontiers of Engineering, pp. 30-40, (2001); Keim D.A., Information Visualization and Visual Data Mining, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 8, 1, pp. 1-8, (2002); Pandey B., Mishra R.B., Knowledge and intelligent computing system in medicine, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 39, 3, pp. 215-230, (2009); Bellazzi R., Zupan B., Predictive data mining in clinical medicine: Current issues and guidelines, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 77, 2, pp. 81-97, (2008); Souza J., Matwin S., Japkowicz N., Evaluating data mining models: A pattern language, PLoP 2002, (2002); Zainon W.M.N.W., Talib A.Z., Belaton B., A New Framework for Phylogenetic Tree Visualization, LNCS, 7067, pp. 348-359, (2011); Zainon W.M.N.W., Talib A.Z., Belaton B., Display-based Approaches for Phylogenetic Tree Visualization, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Distributed Frameworks and Applications (DFmA 2010), Yogyakarta, Indonesia, pp. 53-59, (2010); Altshuler D., Clark A.G., Harvesting Medical Information from the Human Family Tree, Science, 307, 5712, pp. 1052-1053, (2005); Delen D., Analysis of cancer data: A data mining approach, Expert Systems, 26, 1, pp. 100-112, (2009); Kreuseler M., Schumann H., A Flexible Approach for Visual Data Mining, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 8, 1, pp. 39-51, (2002); Cornelissen B., Holten D., Zaidman A., Moonen L., Van Wijk J.J., Van Deursen A., Understanding Execution Traces Using Massive Sequence and Circular Bundle Views, Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC), pp. 49-58, (2007)","W.Mohd.N.

For its effective use in those activities, the graphical representation of traceability data plays an important role. However, several traceability tools lack an excellent visual representation to present these type of data. Therefore, this paper presents a visual framework which has been designed and proposed as a prototype tool that can visualize traceability data. The framework applies data visualization techniques to represent requirements and its artefacts relationships as colour-coded symbols on a node-link diagram; users can traverse the graph with an impact analysis method to understand data and make decisions. The evaluation result shows that the proposed tool is useful and easy enough in terms of improving user interaction and to better understand requirement traceability data. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This method uses metadata in the form of test results of a given set of algorithms on a given set of datasets and calculates an average rank for each algorithm. The ranks are used to construct the average ranking. In this paper we investigate the problem of how the rankings can be reduced by removing non-competitive and redundant algorithms, thereby reducing the number of tests a user needs to conduct on a new dataset to identify the most suitable algorithm. The method proposed involves two phases. In the first one, the aim is to identify the most competitive algorithms for each dataset used in the past. This is done with the recourse to a statistical test. The second phase involves a covering method whose aim is to reduce the algorithms by eliminating redundant variants. The proposed method differs from one earlier proposal in various aspects. One important one is that it takes both accuracy and time into consideration. The proposed method was compared to the baseline strategy which consists of executing all algorithms from the ranking. It is shown that the proposed method leads to much better performance than the baseline. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Algorithm selection; Average ranking; Eliminating non-competitive; Meta-learning; Redundant algorithms","Application programs; Statistical tests; Algorithm selection; Average ranking; Classification algorithm; Competitive algorithms; Effective algorithms; Eliminating non-competitive; Metalearning; Selection methods; Genetic algorithms","","","","","Rare Disease Foundation, RDF, (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006961); Fundació Catalana de Trasplantament, FCT, (UID/EEA/50014/2013)","This work is partially funded by the ERDF through the COMPETE 2020 Programme within project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006961, and by National Funds through the FCT as part of project UID/EEA/50014/2013.","Rice J.R., The algorithm selection problem, Advances in Computers, 15, pp. 65-118, (1976); Brazdil P., Carrier C.G., Soares C., Vilalta R., Metalearning: Applications to Data Mining, (2008); Smith-Miles K.A., Cross-disciplinary perspectives on meta-learning for algorithm selection, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 41, 1, (2009); Brazdil P., Soares C., A comparison of ranking methods for classification algorithm selection, Machine Learning: ECML 2000, pp. 63-75, (2000); Brazdil P.B., Soares C., Da Costa J.P., Ranking learning algorithms: Using IBL and meta-learning on accuracy and time results, Machine Learning, 50, 3, pp. 251-277, (2003); Abdulrahman S.M., Brazdil P., Measures for Combining Accuracy and Time for Meta-learning, Metalearning and Algorithm Selection Workshop at ECAI 2014, pp. 49-50, (2014); Brazdil P., Soares C., Pereira R., Reducing Rankings of Classifiers by Eliminating Redundant Classifiers, pp. 14-21, (2001); Feige U., A threshold of ln n for approximating set cover, Journal of the ACM (JACM), 45, pp. 634-652, (1998); Karp R.M., Reducibility among combinatorial problems, Complexity of Computer Computations, pp. 85-103, (1972); Xu L., Hutter F., Hoos H., Leyton-Brown K., Cross-disciplinary perspectives on meta-learning for algorithm selection, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 32, pp. 565-606, (2008); Feurer M., Springenberg T., Hutter F., Initializing Bayesian hyperparameter optimization via meta-learning, Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2015); Leite R., Brazdil P., Vanschoren J., Selecting classification algorithms with active testing, Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition, pp. 117-131, (2012); Li L., Chu W., Langford J., Schapire R., A contextual-bandit approach to personalized news article recommendation, Proceedings of 19th Www, pp. 661-670, (2010); Lin S., Rank aggregation methods, WIREs Computational Statistics, 2, pp. 555-570, (2010); Leite R., Brazdil P., Active testing strategy to predict the best classification algorithm via sampling and metalearning, ECAI, pp. 309-314, (2010); Demsar J., Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple data sets, The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 7, pp. 1-30, (2006); Neave H.R., Worthington P.L., Distribution-Free Tests, (1988); Van Rijn J.N., Abdulrahman S.M., Brazdil P., Vanschoren J., Fast Algorithm Selection using Learning Curves, Advances in Intelligent Data Analysis Xiv, (2015); Abdulrahman S., Brazdil P., Van Rijn J., Vanschoren J., Algorithm selection via meta-learning and sample-based active testing, Meta-Learning and Algorithm Selection Workshop at Emcl 2015, pp. 55-66, (2015); Vanschoren J., Van Rijn J.N., Bischl B., Torgo L., OpenML: Networked science in machine learning, ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 15, 2, pp. 49-60, (2014); Hall M., Frank E., Holmes G., Pfahringer B., Reutemann P., Witten I.H., The WEKA data mining software: An update, ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 11, 1, pp. 10-18, (2009)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","University of New Brunswick","8th International Conference on Software and Computer Applications, ICSCA 2019","19 February 2019 through 21 February 2019","Penang","147956","","978-145036573-4","","","English","ACM Int.

Natural languages are basically ambiguous which makes the requirements documented in software requirements specification document unclear. This unclear requirement causes that software developers develop software which is different from the expected software based on the customer needs.

However, existing methods that learn common semantic features between visual and textual modalities for multimodal sentiment analysis often overlook the importance of color information, which plays a crucial role in sentiment expression, according to psychology and art theory. This paper proposes a novel model, named ICCI, which aims to enhance multimodal sentiment analysis in social media by integrating color cues, in order to address the limitation in existing approaches. The proposed model leverages both the semantic information from image-text pairs and the color cues from images to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis. The model comprises a feature extraction module that extracts semantic features from both images and text, as well as color features from images. Furthermore, the feature interaction module employs a cross-attention mechanism to enable the interaction of information between semantic features and color features. Finally, the label prediction module integrates all attention features to enhance multimodal sentiment analysis. The proposed model was evaluated through experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, namely MVSA-Single and MVSA-Multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in outperforming existing methods. On MVSA-Single, ICCI achieved an accuracy of 79.33%. Similarly, on MVSA-Multiple, ICCI achieved an accuracy of 73.29%. The results underscore the importance of integrating color information for more accurate sentiment analysis in social media. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Color emotion; Feature interaction; Image-text sentiment analysis; Multimodal sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Social media sentiment","Color; Image analysis; Image classification; Image enhancement; Modal analysis; Semantics; Social networking (online); Color emotion; Feature interactions; Image texts; Image-text sentiment analyse; Multi-modal; Multimodal sentiment analyse; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Social media; Social medium sentiment; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Anwar Hridoy S.A., Ekram M.T., Islam M.S., Ahmed F., Rahman R.M., Localized twitter opinion mining using sentiment analysis, Decis.

The comparison requires the computation of similarity between models in different systems. The idea is to find the most similar model and be re-used in another context especially during the development of a new software system. Models such as UML class diagrams consist of several parameters (such as class name); these parameters are used during the similarity assessment between class diagrams. This chapter investigates the influence of different parameters used during the computation of similarity between class diagrams using artificial neural network (ANN). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Class diagram; Neural network; Similarity; UML models","Computer software; Encoding (symbols); Unified Modeling Language; Class diagrams; Model matching; Neural-networks; Similar models; Similarity; Similarity assessment; Software-systems; UML class diagrams; UML Model; Neural networks","","","","","","","Tenney A.S., Et al., Application of artificial neural networks to stochastic estimation and jet noise modeling, AIAA J, pp. 1-12, (2020); Salami H.O., Ahmed M., Class Diagram Retrieval Using Genetic Algorithm, Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), 2013 12Th International Conference, (IEEE, (2013); Salami H.O., Ahmed M., Retrieving Sequence Diagrams Using Genetic Algorithm, Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE), 2014 11Th International Joint Conference, (IEEE, (2014); Salami H.O., Ahmed M., A Framework for Reuse of Multi-View UML Artifacts.

This paper presents a mobile-based method for mangrove species identification called multi-layer mangrove species identification method (MSIA) and its application for Kilim Geo-forest Park, in Langkawi, Malaysia. This work involves formulating the identification method, the design and development of the mobile application, and its integration with the Mangrove Reference Data Centre. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface to support visitors with limited knowledge on the mangrove tree species. One of the main features of MSIA is the automatic identification of the mangrove tree species based on its leaf which enhances the performance of species identification. Firstly, the mangrove tree leaf is captured using the mobile phone camera. Next, the first layer in the identification method is carried out to identify the leaf shape. Once the species has been identified, additional parameters such as types of tree root, tree bark, flower or fruit will be entered in the second layer of the identification process. A specific mangrove species common name and its related information such as biological information and possible medicinal or commercial worth of the species will then be displayed. This paper presents the design and implementation of MSIA as well as the testing and the evaluation of the method and its application. It is believed that MSIA would make a visit to the mangrove park more meaningful and enjoying to the visitors. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Artificial intelligence; Image processing; Mangrove species; Multi-Layer identification","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Image processing; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Plants (botany); Automatic identification; Biological information; Design and Development; Design and implementations; Identification process; Mangrove species; Species identification; User friendly interface; Forestry","","","","","","","Langkawi Mangrove Biodiversity Database, (2009); Kumar N., Belhumeur P.N., Biswas A., Jacobs D.W., Kress W.J., Lopez I.C., Soares J.V.B., Leafsnap: A computer vision system for automatic plant species identification, ECCV 2012, Part II.

The majority of previous research on reviews has focused on debate, bias, and sentiment analysis. There is a lack of visual perception of the spatiotemporal pattern distribution in these reviews. This study attempts to bridge this gap and proposes an interactive visualization system combining Word cloud and OpenStreetMap to allow for visual exploration of spatial features, location mining, and decision making based on reviews. In this visualization, the original context of the reviews can be first explored through the designed interactive word cloud. Then, the geographical distribution information of the reviews will be presented and absorbed rapidly on the geographic map. Our system can guide users not only through the spatial features of online reviews but also efficiently retrieve their original review context by providing an interactive visualization and intuitive results. Thus, it is appropriate as an alternative method by transforming complex and abstract information into a simple and easy-to-understand visual language for online reviews understanding. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korea Spatial Information Society.","Interactive visualization; OpenStreetMap; Text analysis; Word cloud","","","","","","","","Shin S., Xiang Z., Contextual effects of online review recency: Three research propositions, Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2021., (2021); Lee B., Riche N.H., Karlson A.K., Carpendale S., Sparkclouds: Visualizing trends in tag clouds, IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics, 16, 6, pp. 1182-1189, (2010); Havre S., Hetzler B., Nowell L., ThemeRiver: Visualizing theme changes over time, IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2000.

People travel for business, study, vacation, religious activity and many more. Nonetheless, while travelling, their safety and health condition can be a major concern to travelers as well as concern from their family members. There exists many existing smart traveler app for the purpose of locating a traveler. However, they might produce accurate location. Predicting location in all apps is largely based on the speed of a walking traveler. This paper discusses the techniques for more accurate location tracking and location prediction of a traveler. The techniques are able to track the movement of the traveler using location tracking techniques and predict the location of a missing traveler based on parameters such as walking speed, age, gender, weather condition and the health condition. The results based on an app developed in this research show that the techniques are more accurate and efficient. Also, with these techniques, a better emergency alert system can be incorporated in a smart traveler app. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Location based tracking; Location prediction; People tracking; Smart traveler app","Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Tracking (position); Accurate location; Emergency alert system; Health condition; Location based tracking; Location prediction; People tracking; Safety and healths; Tracking techniques; Location","","","","","","","Reidenberg J.R., Gellman R., Debelak J., Elewa A., Liu N., Privacy and Missing Persons after Natural Disasters, (2013); Munich Attack: Teenage Gunman Kills Nine People at Shopping Centre, (2016); Hajj Pilgrimage: More than 700 Dead in Crush near Mecca, (2015); Louisiana Faces Ongoing Flood Danger as Obama Declares Federal Disaster Zone, (2016); Wang S., Min J., Yi B.K., Location based services for mobiles: Technologies and standards, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communication (ICC 2008), pp. 35-38, (2008); Steiniger S., Neun M., Edwardes A., Foundations of Location Based Services-Lecture Notes, (2006); Zahradnik F., Wi-Fi Positioning System, (2016); Fitzpatrick K., Brewer M.A., Turner S., Another look at pedestrian walking speed, Transp.

Our aim is to develop ways of presenting the information so as to highlight both the common structure of the trees and their points of difference. The impetus for the work comes from the field of bioinformatics, where geneticists construct complex phylogenetic trees to represent the evolution of species or genes. But the techniques can also be used for other treestructured data such as file systems, parse trees, decision trees, and organisational hierarchies. To investigate our techniques, we have built a prototype application that reads and displays phylogenetic trees in the popular Nexus format. The application incorporates a variety of interactive and automated visualisation techniques, and is implemented in Java.

In particular, brain cancer holds the least rate of survival than all other cancer types. The categorization of a brain tumor depends upon the various factors such as texture, shape and location. The medical experts have preferred the appropriate treatment to the patients, based on the accurate identification of tumor type. The process of segmenting the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has high complicacy during the analysis of brain tumor, owing to its variable shape, location, size, and texture. The physicians and radiologists can easily detect and categorize the tumors if there exists a system by combining Computer Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI). An approach of automated segmentation has proposed in this paper, which enables the segmentation of tumor out of MRI images, besides enhances the efficiency of segmentation and classification. The initial functions of this approach include preprocessing and segmentation processes for segmenting tumor or tissue of benign and malignant by expanding a range of data and clustering. A modern learning-based approach has suggested in this study, in order to process the automated segmentation in multimodal MRI images to identify brain tumor, hence the clustering algorithm of Bat Algorithm with Fuzzy C-Ordered Means (BAFCOM) has recommended segmenting the tumor. The Bat Algorithm calculates the initial centroids and distance within the pixels in the clustering algorithm of BAFCOM, which also acquires the tumor through determining the distance among tumor Region of Interest (RoI) and non-tumor RoI. Afterwards, the MRI image has analyzed by the Enhanced Capsule Networks (ECN) method to categorize it as normal and brain tumor. Ultimately, the algorithm of ECN has assessed the performance of proposed approach by distinguishing the two categories of the tumor over MRI images, besides the suggested ECN classifier has assessed by the measurement factors of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In addition, the genetic algorithm has applied to process the automatic tumor stage classification, which in turn classification accuracy enhanced. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Data collected from the various resources are dirty and this will affect the accuracy of prediction result. Data cleansing offers a better data quality which will be a great help for the organization to make sure their data is ready for the analyzing phase. However, the amount of data collected by the organizations has been increasing every year, which is making most of the existing methods no longer suitable for big data. Data cleansing process mainly consists of identifying the errors, detecting the errors and corrects them. Despite the data need to be analyzed quickly, the data cleansing process is complex and time-consuming in order to make sure the cleansed data have a better quality of data. The importance of domain expert in data cleansing process is undeniable as verification and validation are the main concerns on the cleansed data. This paper reviews the data cleansing process, the challenge of data cleansing for big data and the available data cleansing methods. © 2019 The Authors.","Big data; Data cleansing; Data quality","Information systems; Information use; Business decisions; Data cleansing; Data quality; Domain experts; Quality of data; Verification-and-validation; Big data","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8012206)","This work was supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia under RUI Grant Scheme (1001/PKOMP/8012206).","Rahm E., Do H.H., Data cleaning: Problems and current approaches, IEEE Bulletin of the Technical Committee on Data Engineering, 23, pp. 3-13, (2000); Li L., Data Quality and Data Cleaning in Database Applications, (2012); Someswararao C., Rajanikanth J., Chandra Sekhar V., Bhadri Raju M.S.V.S., Data cleaning: A framework for robust data quality in enterprise data warehouse, International Journal of Computer Science and Technology, 3, 3, pp. 36-41, (2012); Saha B., Srivastava D., Data quality: The other face of Big Data, 2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 1294-1297, (2014); Shneiderman B., Plaisant C., Sharpening analytic focus to cope with big data volume and variety, IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, 35, 3, pp. 10-14, (2015); Muller H., Freytag J.-C., Problems, Methods, and Challenges in Comprehensive Data Cleansing, (2003); Gu R.S., Data Cleaning Framework: An Extensible Approach to Data Cleaning, (2010); Khayyat Z., Ilyas I.F., Jindal A., Madden S., Ouzzani M., Papotti P., Bigdansing: A system for big data cleansing, Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, (2015); L'Heureux A., Grolinger K., Elyamany H.F., Capretz M.A.M., Machine learning with big data: Challenges and approaches, IEEE Access, 5, pp. 7776-7797, (2017); Abdullah N., Ismail S.A., Sophiayati S., Sam S.M., Data quality in Big data: A review, International Journal of Advance Soft Computing and Its Application, 7, 3, pp. 16-27, (2015); Hadi H.J., Shnain A.H., Hadishaheed S., Ahmad A.H., Big data and five V's characteristics, International Journal of Advances in Electronics and Computer Science, 2, 1, pp. 16-23, (2015); Data Science Report, (2016); Yakout M., Berti-Equille L., Elmagarmid A.K., Don't be scared: Use SCalable Automatic REpairing with maximal likelihood and bounded changes, The Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, (2013); Cappiello C., Sama W., Vitali M., Quality awareness for a successful big data exploitation, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 37-44, (2018); Cohen B., Vawdrey D.K., Liu J., Caplan D., Yoko Furuya E., Mis F.W., Challenges associated with using large data sets for quality assessment and research in clinical settings, Policy, Politics & Nursing Practice, 16, pp. 117-124, (2015); Sidi F., Shariat Panahy P.H., Affendey L., Jabar A., Marzanah, Ibrahim H., Mustapha A., Data quality: A survey of data quality dimensions, International Conference on Information Retrieval & Knowledge Management, pp. 300-304, (2012); Sonka S., Big data characteristics, International Food and Agribusiness Management Review, 19, A, pp. 7-12, (2016); Wang H., Li M., Bu Y., Li J., Gao H., Zhang J., Cleanix: A parallel big data cleaning system, ACM SIGMOD Record, 44, 4, pp. 35-40, (2015); Swapnil W.K., Yadav A.H., Gupta S., Big data: Characteristics, challenges and data mining, International Journal of Computer Applications, pp. 25-29, (2016); Chu X., Morcos J., Ilyas I.F., Ouzzani M., Papotti P., Tang N., Katara: A data cleaning system powered by knowledge bases and crowdsourcing, Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, (2015); Wang J., Krishnan S., Franklin M.J., Goldberg K., Kraska T., Milo T., A sample-and-clean framework for fast and accurate query processing on dirty data, Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, (2014); Wang H., Li M., Bu Y., Li J., Gao H., Zhang J., Cleanix: A big data cleaning parfait, The Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, (2014); Chu X., Morcos J., Ilyas I.F., Ouzzani M., Papotti P., Tang N., Et al., Katara: Reliable data cleaning with knowledge bases and crowdsourcing, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 8, 12, pp. 1952-1955, (2015); Raman V., Hellerstein J., Potter's Wheel: An interactive data cleaning system, Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, (2001); Lee M.L., Ling T.W., Low W.L., Intelliclean: A Knowledge-based Intelligent Data Cleaner, Proceedings of the Sixth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, (2000); Chu X., Scalable and Holistic Qualitative Data Cleaning, (2017)","W.M.N.

In particular, the emphasis is on visualising the similarities and differences between pairs of trees. There are many research areas (such as biology, linguistics, chemistry and computer science) that use the tree as a basic data structure. The impetus for the work comes from the field of bioinformatics, where biologists construct complex phylogenetic trees to represent the evolution of species or genes. When dealing with these sorts of data, biologists often have to deal with multiple trees generated from the same set of data. The biologists have to compare these trees in order to get a better understanding of these data. This paper aims to explore techniques to visualise the differences between two phylogenetic trees. Specifically, an application has been developed, named VCPT (Visual Comparison of Phylogenetic Trees) that implements for a new algorithm and display-based approaches that will help in visualising the similarity and differences between the phylogenetic trees. © 2010 University Sains Malaysia.","Bioinformatics Visualisation; Phylogenetic Trees; Tree Structured Data","Bioinformatics; Biology; Data structures; Genes; Plant extracts; Visualization; Multiple trees; Phylogenetic trees; Research areas; Tree-structured data; Visual comparison; Trees (mathematics)","","","","","","","Munzner T., Guimbretiere F., Tasiran S., Zhang L., Zhou Y., TreeJuxtaposer: Scalable tree comparison using focus+context with guaranteed visibility, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 22, 3, pp. 453-462, (2003); Irwin R., Biology Lectures: Introduction to Systematics, (2003); The willi henning society, About Willi Henning; Wan Zainon W.N., Calder P., Visualising phylogenetic trees, Proc. 7th Australasian User Interface Conference, pp. 145-152, (2006); Maddison D.R., The Tree of Life: Web Project; Lipscomb D., Basics of Cladistic Analysis, (1998); Carrizo S.F., Phylogenetic trees: An information visualisation perpective, Proc. 2nd Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Conference, pp. 315-320, (2004); Thollesson M., Phylogenetic Inference of Evolutionary Relationships, (2001); Roderic D.M., Component 2.0-User Guide, (1993); Mesquite Manual; Makarenkov V., T-REX: Reconstructing and visualizing phylogenetic trees and reticulation networks, Bioinformatics, 17, 7, pp. 664-668, (2001); Bryant D., Building Trees, Hunting for Trees and Comparing Trees, (1997); Lozano A., Pinter R.Y., Rokhlenko O., Valiente G., Ziv-Ukelson M., Seeded tree alignment, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB), 5, 4, pp. 503-513, (2008); Amenta N., Klinger J., Case study: Visualizing sets of evolutionary trees, Proc.

Data is collected, processed and analyzed to gain useful insight for their organization. Big Data analytics has the potential to improve the quality of life and help to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). To ensure that SDG goals are achieved, we must utilize existing data to meet those targets and ensure accountability. However, data quality is often left out when dealing with data. Any types of errors presented in the dataset should be properly addressed to ensure the analysis provided is accurate and truthful. In this paper, we have addressed the concept of data quality diagnosis to identify the outlier presented in the dataset. The cause of the outlier is further discussed to identify potential improvements that can be done to the dataset. In addition, recommendations to improve the quality of data and data collection systems are provided. © 2021 The Authors.

Reusing of early-stage software artifacts such as UML state machine diagrams increases the benefit reaped from reuse because it allows the reuse of related later-stage artifacts. Among the reuse task, matching and retrieval of similar artifacts from repository are considered the most important task. However, the space for searching the most similar artifacts from the repository can be large, and heuristics algorithm can efficiently be used to search large repositories. Existing work in the literature are based on graph matching using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swamp Optimization (PSO). Different to the existing works, this paper presents the use of Finite State Machine and Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) to match and retrieve state machine diagrams from repository. Experimental results show that our method is effective in retrieving the most similar state machine diagrams from repository for a given query. © 2017 IEEE.","CSA; FSM; GA; ML; models; retrieval; reuse","Gallium; Genetic algorithms; Graphic methods; Learning algorithms; Models; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pattern matching; Software design; Cuckoo search algorithms; Heuristics algorithm; retrieval; reuse; Software artifacts; Software repositories; State machine diagrams; UML state machine; Computer software reusability","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Foundation for Fundamental Research on  Matter, FOM, (203/PKOMP/6711533)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia, under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS: 203/PKOMP/6711533).","Adamu A., Zainon W.M.N.W., Salami H.O., Pre-filtering repository models, 2015 9th Malaysian Software Engineering Conference (MySEC), pp. 206-211, (2015); Adamu A., Zainon W.M.N.W., A review of UML model retrieval approaches, Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 9, (2016); Robles K., Fraga A., Morato J., Llorens J., Towards an ontology-based retrieval of UML class diagrams, Information and Software Technology, 54, pp. 72-86, (2012); Adamu A., Zainoon W.M.N.W., A framework for enhancing the retrieval of UML diagrams, International Conference on Software Reuse, pp. 384-390, (2016); Ahmed M., Towards the development of integrated reuse environments for UML artifacts, ICSEA 2011, the Sixth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances, pp. 426-431, (2011); Salami H.O., Ahmed M., Retrieving sequence diagrams using genetic algorithm, Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE), 2014 11th International Joint Conference on, pp. 324-330, (2014); Park W.-J., Bae D.-H., A two-stage framework for UML specification matching, Information and Software Technology, 53, pp. 230-244, (2011); Ahmed M., Salami H.O., Behavior-based Retrieval of Software, (2015); Yang X.-S., Deb S., Cuckoo search via lévy flights, Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing, 2009.

The consumers' side of the study enables better understanding of the demands and consumers' preferences in the mobile content market. On the other hand, looking into the providers in Malaysia allows the identification of business model adopted, challenges and future trend in the market. This study takes two approaches in looking into the research problem. Selfadministrated survey is adopted in the demand side investigation which involves end-consumers, whereas qualitative interview is deployed in the supplier side investigation which involves providers of mobile contents. The findings of this study could assist the practitioner especially mobile content developers to understand the market in Malaysia, and enable them to serve their customers better. Additionally, the preliminary findings in this study can be the starting points for future empirical research that rigorously examines the mobile content market.","Market analysis; Mobile application; Mobile content; Mobile phone","Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Business models; Demand and supply; Demand-side; Empirical research; Future trends; Malaysia; Market analysis; Mobile applications; Mobile content; Qualitative interviews; Research problems; Commerce","","","","","","","Kuang E., (2009); Mobile In Asia 2011, (2011); Global ICT Developments, (2011); Featuring the Handphone Users Survey Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, (2007); Biljon J.V., Kotz P., Modelling the Factors That Influence Mobile Phone Adoption, Proceedings of the 2007 annual research conference of the South African institute of computer scientists and information technologists on IT research in developing countries, pp. 152-161, (2007); Wilska T.-A., Mobile Phone Use as Part of Young People's Consumption Styles, Journal of Consumer Policy, 26, 4, pp. 441-463, (2003); Yang K.C.C., Exploring Factors Affecting the Adoption of Mobile Commerce in Singapore, Telematics and Informatics, 22, 3, pp. 257-277, (2005); Pagani M., Determinants of Adoption of Third Generation Mobile Multimedia Services, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 18, 3, pp. 46-59, (2004); Rouvinen P., Diffusion of Digital Mobile Telephony: Are Developing Countries Different?, Telecommunications Policy, 30, 1, pp. 46-63, (2006); Wang Y.-S., Lin H.-H., Luarn P., Predicting Consumer Intention to Use Mobile Service, Information Systems Journal, 16, 2, pp. 157-179, (2006); Silverman D., Text and Interaction, (1993); Jung Y., Perez-Mira B., Wiley-Patton S., Consumer adoption of mobile TV: Examining Psychological Flow and Media Content, Computers In Human Behavior, 25, 1, pp. 123-129, (2009); Comber C., Colley A., Hargreaves D.J., Et al., The Effects of Age, Gender and Computer Experience upon Computer Attitudes, Educational Research, 39, 2, pp. 123-133, (1997); Women In a Wireless Word, (2011); de Reuver M., Haaker T., Designing Viable business Models for Context-aware Mobile Services, Telematics and Informatics, 26, 3, pp. 240-248, (2009); Nassereslami F., Saghafi F., Safety Technologies Impacts Survey in M-services Security Provision, International Journal of Digital Content Technology and Its Applications (JDCTA), 4, 4, pp. 207-214, (2010); Lee C.-C., Hsieh M.-C., Huang H.-C., The Influence of Mobile Self-efficacy on Attitude towards Mobile Advertising, Advances In Information Sciences and Service Sciences (AISS), 3, 3, pp. 100-108, (2011); Ho S.Y., Bull S., Users' Trust and Intention to Adopt Personalized Mobile Services, Journal of Next Generation Information Technology, 2, 1, (2011); Yugay O., Semyonov A., Ko F., Et al., Analysis and Implementation of M-commerce in Education for Developing Countries (Uzbekistan case), Journal of Convergence Information Technology (JCIT), 2, 3, pp. 77-88, (2007); Gavalas D., Bellavista P., Cao J., Et al., Mobile Applications: Status and Trends, Journal of Systems and Software, 84, 11, pp. 1823-1826, (2011); Holzer A., Ondrus J., Mobile Application Market: A Developer's Perspective, Telematics and Informatics, 28, 1, pp. 22-31, (2011); Mallat N., Rossi M., Tuunainen V.K., Et al., The Impact of Use Context on Mobile Services Acceptance: The Case of Mobile Ticketing, Journal of Information & Management, 46, 3, pp. 190-195, (2009)","T.

This problem is still greater during the software design stage, and are greater still in UML diagrams. This is principally caused because of the existence of multiple views among UML diagrams. The main issue that arise when assessing the similarity of UML diagrams from multiple views is how consistency can be maintained across different views during the comparison. Previous works have failed to address this issue. They only compare one type of diagram in one stage and another type of diagram in another stage, this manner of similarity assessment lead to incorrect similarity scores, thereby creating inconsistencies in the information conveyed by the UML artifacts during software reuse. This paper presents Multiview similarity assessment technique, in which the similarity of UML diagrams is computed from structural and behavioral views of software systems. © 2018 The Authors.","Multiview; Similarity Accessment; UML Matching Metrics","Computer software; Computer software reusability; Graphic methods; Information systems; Consistency problems; Multi-views; Multiple views; Similarity Accessment; Similarity assessment; Similarity scores; Software systems; UML Matching Metrics; Software design","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (203/PKOMP/6711533)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia, under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS: 203/PKOMP/6711533).","Adamu, Zainoon W.M.N.W., A framework for enhancing the retrieval of uml diagrams,"" software reuse: Bridging with social-awareness, g, Kapitsaki and E.

The agile methodology has gained lots of popularity in the last 15 years and become very traditional and acceptable widely among software engineers; nevertheless, the use of agile methods has extended to cover other areas of software engineering field including Requirement Engineering (RE) that fit the need of web engineering. The pace of the current web's software development is fast and dynamic such that the changes of the requirements during software development and after turning to production phase are possible and recurrent. Therefore, agile software engineering conceptuality has evolved as an adequate approach to overcome changes in the web's software's requirements; due to frequent changes in requirements, web engineers call for help of agile software engineering methods, which strive to truly manage changes in requirements rather than preventing these changes. This paper provides a review on the available agile methodologies that used to assess requirement change management in web engineering. © 2023 IEEE.","Agile Methodologies; Engineering; Requirement Change Management; Software Engineering","Application programs; Software design; Agile Methodologies; Agile methods; Agile software engineering; Change in requirements; Engineering fields; Requirement change managements; Web based development; Web engineering; Web software; Web-based system; Websites","","","","","","","Murugesan S., Deshpande Y., Web Engineering: Managing Diversity and Complexity Of Web Application Development, Ser.

Without proper assistance, these groups of students do face a huge challenge in knowledge acquisition as compared to abled students; they have difficulties in understanding lectures, performing well in exams as well as assignments and require special teaching and learning methods for them. This study proposes an implementation of assistive technology tailored especially for educational institutions in Somalia that consists of the several components required to create a proper communication environment needed for deaf, blind, and dysgraphia students.

Medical images are a patient body or part captured using medical imaging devices such as CT, X-Ray, PET, MRI, and US. Technological advancement introduces E-Healthcare systems, Telemedicine, and Electronic Health Information Systems (EHIS) enabling medical images to flow over the public network for remote healthcare services. The manipulation or replacement of medical images is fatal to the well-being of a patient, thereby requiring protection using watermarking. Watermarking is a data security approach toward protecting medical images against abuse by unauthorized personnel via providing confidentiality, authentication, and integrity verification. The dynamism and importance of medical image watermarking require constant literature update on trends, issues, and challenges which leading to the forgoing research survey. The survey proposes to highlight trending application areas in medical image watermarking research and evaluation of the recent approach adopted by researchers. Furthermore, the survey evaluates existing work in compliance with the standard benchmark requirement in design and performance and presents a discussion on the way forward to other possible research opportunities in the medical image watermarking domain. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Authentication;

The ambiguous requirements could cause the software developers to develop software which is different from what the customer needs. The focus of this paper is to propose an approach to detect syntax and syntactic ambiguity in software requirements specification. In this paper, Parts of speech (POS) tagging technique has been used to detect these ambiguities. A prototype tool has been developed in order to evaluate the proposed approach. The evaluation is done by comparing the detection capabilities of the proposed tool against human capabilities. The overall results show that the humans do have some difficulties in detecting ambiguity in software requirements, especially the syntactic ambiguity and software requirements that contains both syntax and syntactic ambiguity in one sentence. The proposed tool can definitely help the analyst in detecting ambiguity in Software requirements. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Part of speech tagging; Software requirements specification; Syntactic ambiguity; Syntax ambiguity","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (203/PKOMP/6711533); Foundation for Fundamental Research on  Matter, FOM","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia, under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS: 203/PKOMP/6711533).","Anuar U., Ahmad S., Emran N.A., A Simplified Systematic Literature Review: Improving Software Requirements Specification Quality with Boilerplates, (2015); Soares H.A., Moura R.S., A methodology to guide writing Software Requirements Specification document.

It has potential in improving the quality, the productivity, and reduces the overall software development cost. Reusable software components are usually kept in a components library or repository, from where they can be retrieved during reuse. In this paper we present a fast way of identifying a subset of repository models that are potentially similar to a user query prior to retrieval stage. The shortlisted repository models are then compared with the query models in a subsequent computationally demanding retrieval stage to ascertain their actual degree of similarity with the query models. Our method of selecting the subset of repository models is called Pre-filtering. This technique lead to significant reduction in retrieval time, especially when the repository contained large number of candidates solutions to be analyzed during retrieval. © 2015 IEEE.","components; models; pre-filtering; query; repository; software reuse","Models; Software design; Software engineering; components; Degree of similarity; Pre-filtering; query; repository; Reusable software components; Software artifacts; Software development costs; Computer software reusability","","","","","","","Prieto-Diaz R., Status report: Software reusability, Software IEEE, 10, pp. 61-66, (1993); Krueger C.W., Software reuse, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 24, pp. 131-183, (1992); Keswani R., Joshi S., Jatain A., Software reuse in practice, Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies (ACCT) 2014 Fourth International Conference on, pp. 159-162, (2014); Doublait S., Standard reuse practices: Many myths vs. A reality, StandardView, 5, pp. 84-91, (1997); Poulin J.S., Measuring software reusability, Software Reuse: Advances in Software Reusability 1994.
