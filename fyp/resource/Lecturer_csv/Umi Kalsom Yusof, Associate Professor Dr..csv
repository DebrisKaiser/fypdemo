Existing approaches addressing the MSA challenge tend to specialize in distinct biological features, leading to variability in alignment outcomes for the same set of sequences. Consequently, this paper proposes an enhanced evolutionary-based approach that simplifies the sequence alignment problem without considering the sequences in the non-dominated solution. Our method employs a multi-objective optimization technique that uniquely excludes non-dominated solution sets, effectively mitigating computational complexities. Utilizing the Sum of Pairs and the Total Conserved Column as primary objective functions, our approach offers a novel perspective. We adopt an integer coding approach to enhance the computational efficiency, representing chromosomes with sets of integers during the alignment process. Using the SABmark and BAliBASE datasets, extensive experimentation is conducted to compare our method with existing ones. The results affirm the superior solution quality achieved by our approach compared to its predecessors. Furthermore, via the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, a statistical analysis underscores the statistical significance of our model’s improvement (p < 0.05). This comprehensive approach holds promise for advancing Multiple Sequence Alignment in bioinformatics. © 2023 by the authors.","bioinformatics; evolutionary algorithm; genetic algorithm; Multiple Sequence Alignment; optimization","","","","","","King Khalid University, KKU; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Khalid University, (RGP2/52/44)","Funding text 1: The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University for funding this work through a large group Research Project under grant number (RGP2/52/44). ; Funding text 2: The Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University funded this work through a large group research project (under grant number RGP2/52/44).","Paruchuri T., Rao G., Suresh K., Rohit D., Yadav K., Singh S., Nature Inspired Algorithms for Solving Multiple Sequence Alignment Problem: A Review, Arch.

The situation poses a need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of capacity planning and resource optimization while still maintaining their flexibilities. Machine loading - one of the important components of capacity planning is known for its complexity that encompasses various types of flexibilities pertaining to part selection, machine and operation assignment along with constraints. Various studies are done to balance the productivity and flexibility in flexible manufacturing system (FMS). From the literature, the researchers have developed many approaches to reach a suitable balance of exploration (global improvement) and exploitation (local improvement). We adopt hybrid of population approaches; Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Harmony Search algorithm (H-GaHs), to solve this problem that aims on mapping the feasible solution to the domain problem. The objectives are to minimize the system unbalance as well as increase throughput while satisfying the technological constraints such as machine time availability and tool slots. The proposed algorithm is tested for its performance on 10 sample problems available in FMS literature and compared with existing solution approaches. © 2011 IEEE.","Flexible manufacturing system; Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Harmony Search; Machine loading; System unbalance; Throughput","Competition; Computation theory; Genetic algorithms; Loading; Machine components; Optimization; Problem solving; Bio-inspired; Capacity planning; Domain problems; Feasible solution; Harmony search algorithms; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Machine loading; Machine time; Manufacturing industries; Part selection; Product cycle time; Product variety; Resource optimization; Solution approach; System unbalance; Technological constraints; Flexible manufacturing systems","","","","","","","Viswanadham N., Narahari Y., Performance Modeling of Automated Manufacturing Systems, (1992); Stecke K.E., Formulation and solution of nonlinear integer production planning problems for flexible manufacturing systems, Management Science, 29, 3, pp. 273-288, (1983); Kumar A., Prakash, Tiwari M.K., Shankar R., Baveja A., Solving machine-loading problem of a flexible manufacturing system with constraint-based genetic algorithm, European Journal of Operational Research, 175, 2, pp. 1043-1069, (2006); Srinivas, Tiwari M.K., Allada V., Solving the machine-loading problem in a flexible manufacturing system using a combinatorial auction-based approach, International Journal of Production Research, 42, 9, pp. 1879-1893, (2004); Ammons J.C., Lofgren C.B., McGinnis L.F., A large scale machine loading problem in flexible assembly, Annals of Operations Research, 3, 7, pp. 317-332, (1985); Shanker Kripa, Tzen Ya-Juei Jeffrey, Loading and dispatching problem in a random flexible manufacturing system, International Journal of Production Research, 23, 3, pp. 579-595, (1985); Mukhopadhyay S.K., Maiti Bibekananda, Garg Sandip, Heuristic solution to the scheduling problems in flexible manufacturing system, International Journal of Production Research, 29, 10, pp. 2003-2024, (1991); Tiwari M.K., Vidyarthi N.K., Solving machine loading problems in a flexible manufacturing system using a genetic algorithm based heuristic approach, International Journal of Production Research, 38, 14, pp. 3357-3384, (2000); Li Y.I.W.H.W.D.W., Genetic algorithm approach to earliness and tardiness production scheduling and planning problem, International Journal of Production Economics, 54, pp. 65-76, (1998); Yogeswaran M., Ponnambalam S.G., Tiwari M.K., An efficient hybrid evolutionary heuristic using genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm to solve machine loading problem in fms, International Journal of Production Research, 47, 19, pp. 5421-5448, (2009); Che Z.-H., Using hybrid genetic algorithms for multi-period product configuration change planning, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 6, 6, pp. 2761-2785, (2010); Geem Z.W., Kim J.H., Loganathan G.V., A new heuristic optimization algorithm: Harmony search, Simulation, 76, 2, pp. 60-68, (2001); Geem Z.W., School Bus Routing Using Harmony Search, (2005); Geem Z., Improved harmony search from ensemble of music players, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4251, (2006); Al-Betar M., Khader A., A harmony search algorithm for university course timetabling, Annals of Operations Research, pp. 1-29, (2010); Goldberg D.E., Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning, (1989); Saravanan R., Manufacturing Optimization Through Intelligent Techniques, (2006); Bloomfield M.W., Herencia J.E., Weaver P.M., Analysis and benchmarking of meta-heuristic techniques for lay-up optimization, Computers & Structures, 88, 5-6, pp. 272-282, (2010); Michalewicz Z., Nazhiyath G., Genocop iii: A co-evolutionary algorithm for numerical optimization problems with nonlinear constraints, IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation, 2, pp. 647-651, (1995); Cormier D., O'Grady P., Sanii E., A constraint-based genetic algorithm for concurrent engineering, International Journal of Production Research, 36, 6, pp. 1679-1697, (1998); Mukhopadhyay A., Roy A., Das S., Abraham A., Populationvariance and explorative power of harmony search: An analysis, Digital Information Management, 2008.

Most manufactured products usually have a very short life cycle. These scenarios imply the need to improve the efficiency of capacity planning, an important aspect of the machine allocation plan known for its complexity. Various studies have been performed to balance productivity and flexibility in the flexible manufacturing system (FMS). Many approaches have been developed by the researchers to determine the suitable balance between exploration (global improvement) and exploitation (local improvement). However, not much work has been focused on the domain of machine allocation problem that considers the effects of machine breakdowns. This paper develops a model to minimize the effect of machine breakdowns, thus increasing the productivity. The objectives are to minimize system unbalance and makespan as well as increase throughput while satisfying the technological constraints such as machine time availability. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed model, results for throughput, system unbalance and makespan on real industrial datasets were performed with applications of intelligence techniques, that is, a hybrid of genetic algorithm and harmony search. The result aims to obtain a feasible solution to the domain problem. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Machine shop practice; Manufacture; Productivity; Semiconductor device manufacture; Capacity planning; Feasible solution; Industrial machines; Machine allocation; Machine breakdown; Manufactured products; Semiconductor industry; Technological constraints; Flexible manufacturing systems","","","","","","","Huang D., Yan J., Qiao F., 8th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision, 3, pp. 2217-2222, (2004); Nanvala H.B., Awari G.K., International Journal of Engineering and Technology, 3, pp. 64-73, (2011); Pongcharoen P., Hicks C., Braiden P.M., European Journal of Operational Research, 152, pp. 215-225, (2004); Kumar A., Prakash, Tiwari M.K., Shankar R., Baveja A., European Journal of Operational Research, 175, pp. 1043-1069, (2006); Geem Z., (2006); Al-Betar M., Khader A., Annals of Operations Research, 194, pp. 3-31, (2012); Geem Z.W., Kim J.H., Loganathan G., SIMULATION, 76, pp. 60-68, (2001); Mukhopadhyay A., Roy A., Das S., Abraham A., Third International Conference on Digital Information Management, 2008.

This scenario has given rise to the demand for improved capacity planning efficiency while maintaining their flexibilities. One important aspect of capacity planning is machine loading, which is known for its complexity encompassing various types of flexibility aspects that pertain to part selection and operation assignment along with constraint. The main objective of flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is to balance the productivity and flexibility of the production shop floor. From the literature, researchers have proposed many methods and approaches to attain a balance in exploring (global improvement) and exploiting (local improvement). We propose a constraint-chromosome genetic algorithm to solve this problem, which aims at mapping the right chromosome representation to the domain problem as well as helps avoid getting trapped in local minima. The objective functions are to minimize the system unbalance and increase throughput while satisfying the technological constraints. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on 10 sample problems available in the FMS literature and compared with existing solution methods Based on the results, the overall combined objective function increased by 3.60% from the previous best result. © 2012 ISSN 1349-4198.","Flexible manufacturing system; Genetic algorithm; Machine loading; System unbalance; Through-put","Chromosomes; Competition; Flexible manufacturing systems; Genetic algorithms; Loading; Capacity planning; Domain problems; Local minimums; Machine loading; Manufacturing industries; Market environment; Objective functions; Part selection; Product variety; Production shops; Short product; Solution methods; System unbalance; Technological constraints; Problem solving","","","","","","","Viswanadham N., Narahari Y., Performance Modeling of Automated Manufacturing Systems, (1992); Stecke K.E., Formulation and solution of nonlinear integer production planning problems for flexible manufacturing systems, Management Science, 29, 3, pp. 273-288, (1983); Berrada M., Stecke K.E., A branch and bound approach for machine load balancing in flexible manufacturing systems, Management Science, 32, 10, pp. 1316-1335, (1986); Hwang S., Models For Production Planning In Flexible Manufacturing System, (1986); Liang M., Dutta S.P., An integrated approach to the part selection and machine loading problem in a class of flexible manufacturing systems, European Journal of Operational Research, 67, 3, pp. 387-404, (1993); Kumar A., Prakash M., Tiwari K., Shankar R., Baveja A., Solving machine-loading problem of a flexible manufacturing system with constraint-based genetic algorithm, European Journal of Operational Research, 175, 2, pp. 1043-1069, (2006); Srinivas M., Tiwari K., Allada V., Solving the machine-loading problem in a flexible manufac-turing system using a combinatorial auction-based approach, International Journal of Production Research, 42, 9, pp. 1879-1893, (2004); Ammons J.C., Lofgren C.B., McGinnis L.F., A large scale machine loading problem in flexible assembly, Annals of Operations Research, 3, 7, pp. 317-332, (1985); Shanker K., Tzen Y.-J.J., A loading and dispatching problem in a random flexible manufacturing system, International Journal of Production Research, 23, 3, pp. 579-595, (1985); Mukhopadhyay S.K., Midha S., Krishna V.M., A heuristic procedure for loading problems in flexible manufacturing systems, International Journal of Production Research, 30, 9, pp. 2213-2228, (1992); Tiwari M.K., Hazarika B., Vidyarthi N.K., Jaggi P., Mukhopadhyay S.K., A heuristic solution approach to the machine loading problem of an FMS and its petri net model, International Journal of Production Research, 35, 8, pp. 2269-2284, (1997); Sarin S., Chen C., The machine loading and tool allocation problem in a flexible manufacturing system, International Journal of Production Research, 25, 7, pp. 1081-1094, (1987); Nayak G.K., Acharya D., Part type selection, machine loading and part type volume deter-mination problems in FMS planning, International Journal of Production Research, 36, 7, pp. 1801-1824, (1998); Mukhopadhyay S.K., Singh M.K., Srivastava R., FMS machine loading: A simulated annealing approach, International Journal of Production Research, 36, 6, pp. 1529-1547, (1998); Shanker K., Srinivasulu A., Some solution methodologies for loading problems in a flexible manufacturing system, International Journal of Production Research, 27, 6, pp. 1019-1034, (1989); Sarma U.M.B.S., Kant S., Rai R., Tiwari M.K., Modelling the machine loading problem of FMSs and its solution using a tabu-search-based heuristic, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 15, 4, pp. 285-295, (2002); Swarnkar R., Tiwari M.K., Modeling machine loading problem of FMSs and its solution methodology using a hybrid tabu search and simulated annealing-based heuristic approach, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 20, 3, pp. 199-209, (2004); Nagarjuna N., Mahesh O., Rajagopal K., A heuristic based on multi-stage programming approach for machine-loading problem in a flexible manufacturing system, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 22, 4, pp. 342-352, (2006); Li Y., Ip W.H., Wang D.W., Genetic algorithm approach to earliness and tardiness production scheduling and planning problem, International Journal of Production Economics, 54, pp. 65-76, (1998); Tiwari M.K., Vidyarthi N.K., Solving machine loading problems in a flexible manufacturing system using a genetic algorithm based heuristic approach, International Journal of Production Research, 38, 14, pp. 3357-3384, (2000); Ip W.H., Li Y., Man K.F., Tang K.S., Multi-product planning and scheduling using genetic algorithm approach, Comput.

However, the reasons that distinguish the winning and losing positions remain actively researched which leads to the utilization of the search “indicator”. Conspiracy number search (CNS) and proof number search (PNS) had been popularly adopted as the search indicators in MIN/MAX and AND/OR tree, respectively. However, their limitations had encouraged the need for an alternative search indicator. The single conspiracy number (SCN) is a search indicator inspired by CNS and PNS which measure the difficulty of getting MIN/MAX value over a threshold point for a current root node. Recently, SCN had been successfully applied in Chinese chess to analyze both the progress pattern and long-term position. In this paper, analysis of the SCN within the game of checkers is conducted where different SCN threshold values and varying depth of the search tree were considered. Checkers was chosen due to its smaller search space and contain a rule that affects the shape of the search tree. The experimental results show that the SCN values stabilize as the depth of the search tree increases whether the player is in winning, drawing or losing position.

Utilizing resources (i.e. machines) is vital in order to maintain continuous flow of manufacturing as well as their efficiency and productivity. However, machine maintenance is being overlooked in most cases of the semiconductor assembly processes. This will greatly affect the effectiveness and productivity of semiconductor industry when machine breakdowns happen. Various maintenance models had been proposed by previous researchers which focuses on a different mode and environment of maintenance in manufacturing. The objective of this study is to maximize the maintenance throughput while satisfying resource constraints. A new model using harmony search (HS) algorithm, slightly modified to suit the manufacturing constraints, was proposed and tested with an industrial datasets to examine its effectiveness. A comparative analysis of both with and without the HS algorithm application is conducted. From the results, the proposed HS algorithm manages to achieve a positive improvement of 10% from an original industrial maintenance schedule, where the maximum maintenance throughput increases from 71.43% to 78.57%. © 2013 IEEE.","harmony search; machine maintenance; scheduling; semiconductor industry","Productivity; Scheduling; Semiconductor device manufacture; Harmony search; Harmony search algorithms; Industrial maintenance; Machine maintenance; Maintenance scheduling; Manufacturing constraint; Semiconductor assembly; Semiconductor industry; Preventive maintenance","","","","","","","Kalsom Yusof U., Deris S., Budiarto R., Machine allocation optimization in semiconductor assembly industry using a hybrid of bio-inspired and musical-harmony approach, The 7th International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control (ICICIC2012), (2012); Basnet C., Joe H., Scheduling and control of exible manufacturing systems: A critical review, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing 7, 6, pp. 340-355, (1994); Gertsbakh I., Handbook of Reliability Engineering, (2005); Higgins L.R., Mobley R.K., Smith R., Maintenance Engineering Handbook, (2002); Ben-Daya M., Duffuaa S.O., Maintenance, Modeling, and Optimization, pp. 3-34, (2000); Lorden G., Remer D.S., Mathematical model for preventive maintenance scheduling, DNS Progress Report, pp. 144-149, (1979); Wu S., Zuo M.J., Linear and nonlinear preventive maintenance models, IEEE Transactions on Reliability, 59, pp. 242-249, (2010); Lindqvist B., Doksum K.A., Mathematical and statistical methods in reliability, Series on Quality, Reliability and Engineering Statistics, 7, (2003); Kobbacy K.A.H., Percy D., Fawzi B., Small data sets and preventive maintenance modelling, Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering, 3, pp. 136-142, (1997); Percy D.F., Kobbacy K.A., Preventive maintenance modelling a bayesian perspective, Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering, 2, pp. 15-24, (1996); Tai A., Alkalai L., Chau S., On-board Preventive Maintenance for Long-life Deep Space Missions: A Model-based Analysis, pp. 196-205, (1998); Nourelfath M., Fitouhi M., Machani M., An integrated model for production and preventive maintenance planning in multi-state systems, Reliability IEEE Transactions on, 59, pp. 496-506, (2010); Qian C.H., Ito K., Nakagawa T., Optimal preventive maintenance policies for a shock model with given damage level, Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering, 11, pp. 216-227, (2005); Fu X.Y., Marcus M., Fernandez-Gaucherand S., Optimization of preventive maintenance scheduling for semiconductor manufacturing systems: Models and implementation, Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications, pp. 407-411, (2001); Mobley R.K., Maintenance Fundamentals, (2004); Xiaodong Y., Fernandez-Gaucherand E., Fu M.C., Marcus S.I., Optimal preventive maintenance scheduling in semiconductor manufacturing, IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, 17, 3, pp. 345-356, (2004); Geem Z., Harmony search applications in industry, Soft Computing Applications in Industry, pp. 117-134, (2008); Khalid M.N.A., Yusof U.K., Sabudin M., Solving flexible manufacturing system distributed scheduling problem subject to maintenance using harmony search algorithm, 2012 4th Conference on Data Mining and Optimization (DMO), pp. 73-79, (2012); Yusof U.K., Deris S., Budiarto R., Harmony search algorithm for flexible manufacturing system (FMS) machine loading problem, 2011 3rd Conference on Data Mining and Optimization (DMO), pp. 26-31, (2011); Jeong K.-Y., Phillips D.T., Operational efficiency and effectiveness measurement, International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 21, 11, pp. 1404-1416, (2001); Arpan M., Et al., Population-variance and explorative power of harmony search: An analysis, Third International Conference on Digital Information Management 2008.

The assembly line, which represents a long-term investment of the manufacturing industry, needs to be efficiently utilized. While assembly line balancing (ALB) problem had been studied for decades, oversights on the bottleneck resources could significantly impede its efficiency. In leveraging such information as part of the optimization problem, a contagious artificial immune network (CAIN) approach is proposed to simultaneously address ALB efficiency and bottleneck resources while achieving a truly balanced production line. A computational experiment conducted on benchmark data sets has demonstrated a proof-of-concept, where leveraging knowledge-intensive optimization approach had successfully produced high-quality solutions up to 100% improvement with statistically significant justification. Such findings may play an essential determinant in the manufacturing industry, whether being relevant or left out in the era of increasingly being information-driven. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial immune system; assembly line balancing; bone marrow model; clonal selection; Manufacturing system; shifting bottleneck; Type E","Assembly; Assembly machines; Benchmarking; Biomimetics; Efficiency; Manufacture; Optimization; Artificial immune networks; Assembly line balancing; Assembly line balancing problems; Computational experiment; High-quality solutions; Manufacturing industries; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Knowledge management","","","","","Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, JAIST; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8014084)","This work was supported by the collaborative work between Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) and Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) through Research University under Grant (RUI) 1001/PKOMP/8014084.","Bortolini M., Ferrari E., Gamberi M., Pilati F., Faccio M., Assembly system design in the industry 4.0 era: A general framework, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 50, 1, pp. 5700-5705, (2017); Al-Hawari T., Ali M., Al-Araidah O., Mumani A., Development of a genetic algorithm for multi-objective assembly line balancing using multiple assignment approach, Int.

These new tests are compared to gold standard tests, where the performance of binary diagnostic tests is usually measured by sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp). However, these accuracy measures are often biased owing to selective verification of the patients, known as partial verification bias (PVB). Inverse probability bootstrap (IPB) sampling is a general method to correct sampling bias in model-based analysis and produces debiased data for analysis. However, its utility in PVB correction has not been investigated before. The objective of this study was to investigate IPB in the context of PVB correction under the missing-at-random assumption for binary diagnostic tests. IPB was adapted for PVB correction, and tested and compared with existing methods using simulated and clinical data sets. The results indicated that IPB is accurate for Sn and Sp estimation as it showed low bias. However, IPB was less precise than existing methods as indicated by the higher standard error (SE). Despite this issue, it is recommended to use IPB when subsequent analysis with full data analytic methods is expected. Further studies must be conducted to reduce the SE. © 2022 by the authors.","correction method; diagnostic test; inverse probability bootstrap sampling; partial verification bias; propensity score","analytic method; article; bootstrapping; diagnosis; diagnostic test accuracy study; human; probability; propensity score; sampling bias; sensitivity and specificity; simulation","","","","","Research Creativity and Management Office; School of Computer Sciences; School of Medical Sciences at Universiti Sains Malaysia","This research was funded by the Research Creativity and Management Office, School of Computer Sciences, and School of Medical Sciences at Universiti Sains Malaysia for the article processing charge.","O'Sullivan J.W., Banerjee A., Heneghan C., Pluddemann A., Verification bias, BMJ Evid.

To support community participation, one of the approaches is assisting the public in recognizing the mosquitoes that carry pathogens. Therefore, this study aims to build an automatic recognition system to identify mosquitos at the public community level. We construct a customized image dataset consisting of three mosquito species in either damaged or un-damaged body conditions. To distinguish the mosquito in harsh conditions, we explore two state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) architectures: (i) a freezing convolutional base, with partial trainable weights, and (ii) training the entire model with most of the trainable weights. We project a weighted feature map on different layers of the model to visualize the morphological region used by the model in classification and compared it with the morphological key used by the expert. RESULT: It was found that the model with architecture two and the Adam optimizer achieves at least 98% accuracy in mosquito and conditions identification and when implemented on an independent dataset, the Xception model generalizes the best result with an accuracy of 0.7775 and 0.795 precision. Moreover, most of the morphological regions used by the model are able to match those of the human expert. CONCLUSION: We report a customized DL model for performing pest mosquito taxonomy identification, and through visualization, some regions using computers to discriminate mosquito species could be adopted later in systematic identification. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.","deep convolutional neural network; expert system; pest mosquito; public engagement; vector control","Algorithms; Animals; Culicidae; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks, Computer; algorithm; expert system; recognition; surveillance and enforcement; vector; algorithm; animal; human; image processing; mosquito; procedures","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education Fundamental Research Grant Scheme, (FRGS/1/2021/STG03/KDUPG/02/1)","The work was partly supported by Ministry of Higher Education Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) (FRGS/1/2021/STG03/KDUPG/02/1) SQO, Principal Investigator.

Diabetic eye screening has become a challenging task for ophthalmologist as they need to deal with large number of patients to be diagnosed, creating a need to develop tool that may help ophthalmologist to classify the severity of DR in order to establish an adequate therapy. Previous researchers have studied machine learning to propose an automatic DR classification using the clinical variables. However, it needs to be improvised especially in terms of accuracy. Hence, this paper aims to propose an optimal or near-optimal DR classifier using the Support Vector Machine with hyperparameter optimization. This study considered three classes of diabetic patients which were patients who do not have DR (NODR), patients with non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and patients with proliferative DR (PDR), instead of focusing only on two classes (NO DR, DR). The radial basis function, polynomial, sigmoid kernel and their respective hyperparameters were tested in this study in order to find the best kernel and combination of hyperparameters that can improve the performance of SVM. The results obtained show that SVM-radial kernel with cost value,64, 0.03 gives the best accuracy at 85.45%. © 2019 International Center for Scientific Research and Studies.","Classification; Diabetic retinopathy; Hyperparameter; Optimization; Support vector machine","","","","","","University of Southern Maine, USM; Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors wish to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for the support it has extended in the completion of the present research through the support of USM Fellowship 2017/2018.","Global reports on diabetes, Tech. rep., (2016); Piri S., Delen D., Liu T., Zolbanin H.M., A data analytics approach to building a clinical decision support system for diabetic retinopathy: Developing and deploying a model ensemble, Decision Support Systems, 101, pp. 12-27, (2017); Zaki W.M.D.W., Zulkiey M.A., Hussain A., Halim W.H.W., Mustafa N.B.A., Ting L.S., Diabetic retinopathy assessment: Towards an automated system, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 24, pp. 72-82, (2016); Abdalla M., Hunter A., Al-Diri B., Quantifying retinal blood vessels' tortuosity|review, in: Science and Information Conference (SAI), 2015, pp. 687-693, (2015); Mapayi T., Tapamo J.-R., Viriri S., Adio A., Automatic retinal vessel detection and tortuosity measurement, Image Analysis & Stereology, 35, 2, (2016); Wu B., Zhu W., Shi F., Zhu S., Chen X., Automatic detection of microaneurysms in retinal fundus images, Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, 55, pp. 106-112, (2017); Evirgen H., CMerkezi M., Prediction and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy using data mining technique, Turkish Online Journal of Science & Technology, 4, 3, pp. 32-37, (2014); Balakrishnan V., Shakouri M.R., Hoodeh H., Et al., Predictions using data mining and case-based reasoning: a case study for retinopathy, World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, International Journal of Medical, Health, Biomedical, Bioengineering and Pharmaceutical Engineering, 6, 3, pp. 55-58, (2012); Skevolakas M., Zarkogianni K., Karamanos B.G., Nikita K.S., A hybrid decision support system for the risk assessment of retinopathy development as a long term complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus, Engineering in medicine and biology society (EMBC), 2010 annual international conference of the IEEE, pp. 6713-6716, (2010); Ananthapadmanabhan K., Parthiban G., Diabetic retinopathy using data mining classification techniques, Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 7, 10, pp. 1498-1503, (2014); Yu W., Liu T., Valdez R., Gwinn M., Khoury M.J., Application of support vector machine modeling for prediction of common diseases: the case of diabetes and pre-diabetes, BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, 10, 1, (2010); Huang H.-Y., Lin C.-J., Linear and kernel classification: When to use which?, Proceedings of the 2016 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, SIAM, pp. 216-224, (2016); Riggelsen C., Approximation methods for efficient learning of Bayesian networks, (2008); Probst P., Bischl B., Boulesteix A.-L., Tunability: Importance of hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms, arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.09596, (2018); Wu S., McAuley K., Harris T., Development of a model selection criterion based on mean squared error, The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering, 89, 2, pp. 325-336, (2011); Lipton Z.C., Elkan C., Naryanaswamy B., Optimal thresholding of classifiers to maximize f1 measure, pp. 225-239, (2014); Varma K.V., Allam Appa Rao T.M.L., Rao P.N., A computational intelligence approach for a better diagnosis of diabetic patients, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 40, pp. 1758-1765, (2014); Priyadarrshini K., Laksahmi I., Prediction analysis of diabetes using bayesian network and naïve bayes technique, International conference on advancements in computing technologies, 4, 2, pp. 71-74, (2018); Weng C.-H., Huang T.C.-K., Han R.-P., Disease prediction with different types of neural network classifiers, Telematics and Informatics, 33, 2, pp. 277-292, (2016); Powers D.M., What the f1 measure doesn't measure, Tech. rep., (2014); Yekkehkhany B., Safari A., Homayouni S., Hasanlou M., A comparison study of different kernel functions for svm-based classification of multi-temporal polarimetry sar data, The International Archives of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 40, 2, (2014)","","","International Center for Scientific Research and Studies","","","","","","20748523","","","","English","Int.

There are two main approaches being studied to solve the problem: linear programming-based and bio-inspired approaches. Recently, more studies are focusing on bio-inspired approaches, where amongst them, genetic algorithm (GA) is being the most popular one. We propose a constraint-chromosome (CCGA) to solve this problem by applying the workable chromosome representation to the domain problem. The approach developed helps to avoid from getting trapped at local minima and is able to search for more solutions. This method is chosen to allow the running of GA in its original form as well as to ensure the computation is straightforward and simple. The objective of the algorithm is to optimize the utilization of the machines that leads to an increase in the company's overall profit. It has been found that the proposed CCGA is able to propose good solution to the problem. © 2010 IEEE.","Capacity planning; Genetic Algorithm; Machine allocation; Optimization approach; Semiconductor manufacturing","Chromosomes; Genetic algorithms; Information technology; Linear programming; Manufacture; Optimization; Profitability; Bio-inspired approach; Capacity planning; Domain problems; Local minimums; Machine allocation; Machine loading problems; Machine utilization; Optimization approach; Semiconductor assembly; Semiconductor manufacturing; Problem solving","","","","","","","Huang D., Van J., Qiao F., Modeling with hierarchical Petri net of semiconductor manufacturing system, Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision Conference, ICARCV 2004 8th, 3, pp. 2217-2222, (2004); Chou Y.C., Cheng C.T., Yang F.C., Liang Y.Y., Evaluating alternative capacity strategies in semiconductor manufacturing under uncertain demand and price scenarios, International Journal of Production Economics, 105, pp. 591-606, (2007); Liang Y.Y., Chou Y.C., Option-based capacity planning for semiconductor manufacturing, IEEE International Symposium on Semiconductor Manufacturing, pp. 77-80, (2003); Rajagopalan S., Capacity expansion with alternative technology choices, European Journal of Operational Research, 77, (1994); Hung Y.-F., Wang Q.-Z., A new formulation technique for alternative material planning; an approach for semiconductor bin allocation planning, Comput.

However, this is because the default medical diagnostic techniques are not affordable by common people. This inspires many researchers to rescue the situation by using soft computing and machine learning approaches to bring a halt to the situation. These approaches use the medical data of the patients to predict the presence of the disease or not. Although, most of these data contains some redundant and irrelevant features that need to be discarded to enhance the prediction accuracy. As such, feature selection has become necessary to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce the number of features. In this study, two different but related cuckoo inspired algorithms, cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA), are proposed for feature selection on some heart disease datasets. Both the algorithms used the general filter method during subset generation. The obtained results showed that CSA performed better than COA both concerning fewer number of features as well as prediction accuracy on all the datasets. Finally, comparison with the state of the art approaches revealed that CSA also performed better on all the datasets. © 2018, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

These aims are conflicting with one another, and a choice must be made in the presence of the trade-off between them. Numerous researches deal with feature selection problem but, they are mostly single-objective based. Nowadays, multi-objective optimisation approaches are becoming the most suitable approaches to deal with feature selection problems. They can easily create a balance between selected features and classification accuracy or error rate. Evolutionary computation techniques have been applied for multi-objective feature selection. Cuckoo optimisation algorithm is among the most popular technique that is exceptional in solving the problems of feature selection. Based on the binary cuckoo optimisation algorithm, two different multi-objective filter-based feature selection frameworks are presented with the idea of nondominated sorting genetic algorithms NSGAIII (BCNSG3) along with NSGAII (BCNSG2). Thus, four multi-objective filter-based feature selection approaches are proposed by employing mutual information along with gain ratio based-entropy as the respective filter evaluation measures in all the proposed frameworks. The results obtained are examined and analysed against the existing methods and single objective scheme on fourteen (14) datasets of varying degree of difficulties. The outcome of the experiments displays that the proposed multi-objective algorithms successfully derive a set of nondominated solutions that used the least feature size and attained the best error rate than using full-length features. In general, BCNSG2 obtained the best results compared to the existing methods and single-objective algorithm, whereas BCNSG3 outdoes all other approaches. © 2013 IEEE.","Cuckoo optimization algorithm; gain ratio based-entropy; machine learning and classification; multi-objective feature selection; mutual information; NSGA II; NSGA III","Classification (of information); Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Classification accuracy; Classification performance; Evolutionary computation techniques; Feature selection problem; Multi objective algorithm; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Nondominated solutions; Optimization algorithms; Feature extraction","","","","","Woosong University, (1001/PKOMP/8014084); Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work was supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia together with the Endicott College of International Studies (ECIS), Woosong University, South Korea, under Grant 1001/PKOMP/8014084.","Li J., Cheng K., Wang S., Morstatter F., Trevino R.P., Tang J., Liu H., Feature selection:Adata perspective, ACMComput.

Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is an NP-hard problem in the sequence alignment. In the last three decades, the MSA problem has drawn a great deal of interest from biologists and scientists. It is an essential method to identify the structural and behavioural attributes of biomolecules present in organisms and vital to biological processes. Nature-inspired algorithms are one of the approaches to solve the MSA problem of aligning multiple sequences at a time. They construct powerful tools to overpower traditional optimization techniques to find an accurate solution. This investigative work (HHO-MSA) brings a new nature-inspired algorithm known as the Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO) Algorithm to solve the MSA problem. HHO's key influence is the cooperative behaviour and hunting style of the Harris hawks in nature called the surprise pounce. The computational results across five references of the BAliBASE dataset proven the proposed HHO-MSA method's effectiveness by reaching great results (up to 83.5% optimum solutions). Findings were statistically supported while comparing it with other established literature works to solve the MSA problem. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Behavioral research; Biomimetics; Data Science; Molecular biology; NP-hard; Optimization; Biological process; Computational results; Multiple sequence alignments; Multiple sequences; Nature inspired algorithms; Optimization techniques; Optimum solution; Sequence alignments; Intelligent computing","","","","","","","Thompson J D, Thierry J C, Poch O, Bioinformatics, 19, pp. 1155-1161, (2003); Wang L, Jiang T, Journal of computational biology, 1, pp. 337-348, (1994); Do C B, Katoh K, Methods Mol Biol, 484, pp. 379-413, (2008); Needleman S B, Wunsch C D, J Mol Biol, 48, pp. 443-453, (1970); Smith T F, Waterman M S, J Mol Biol, 147, pp. 195-197, (1981); Heringa J, Taylor W R, Curr Opin Struct Biol, 7, pp. 416-421, (1997); Notredame C, Pharmacogenomics, 3, pp. 131-144, (2002); Eddy S R, BMC Bioinformatics, 3, (2002); Shyu C, Sheneman L, Foster J A, Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines, 5, pp. 121-144, (2004); Lipman D J, Altschul S F, Kececioglu J D, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 86, pp. 4412-4415, (1989); Hogeweg P, Hesper B, J Mol Evol, 20, pp. 175-186, (1984); Feng D F, Doolittle R F, Journal of Molecular Evolution, 25, pp. 351-360, (1987); Thompson J D, Higgins D G, Gibson T J, Nucleic Acids Res, 22, pp. 4673-4680, (1994); Thompson J D, Koehl P, Ripp R, Poch O, Proteins, 61, pp. 127-136, (2005); Goldberg D E, Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning, (1989); Holland J H, Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems: An Introductory Analysis with Applications to Biology, Control and Artificial Intelligence, (1992); Heidari A A, Mirjalili S, Faris H, Aljarah I, Mafarja M, Chen H, Future generation computer systems, 97, pp. 849-872, (2019); Wadud M S, Islam M R, Kundu N, Kabir M R, Multiple sequence alignment using chemical reaction optimization algorithm, Intelligent Systems Design and Applications, (2018); Gotoh O, J Mol Biol, 264, pp. 823-838, (1996); Katoh K, Misawa K, Kuma K, Miyata T, Nucleic Acids Res, 30, pp. 3059-3066, (2002); Katoh K, Kuma K, Toh H, Miyata T, Nucleic Acids Res, 33, pp. 511-518, (2005); Edgar R C, Nucleic Acids Res, 32, pp. 1792-1797, (2004); Yamada S, Gotoh O, Yamana H, BMC Bioinformatics, 7, (2006); Pei J, Grishin N V, Nucleic Acids Res, 34, pp. 4364-4374, (2006); Notredame C, Higgins D G, Nucleic Acids Res, 24, pp. 1515-1524, (1996); Naznin F, Sarker R, Essam D, BMC Bioinformatics, 12, (2011); Naznin F, Sarker R, Essam D, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 16, pp. 615-631, (2012); Gondro C, Kinghorn B P, Genet Mol Res, 6, pp. 964-982, (2007); Taheri J, Zomaya A Y, BMC Genomics, 10, (2009); Lee Z J, Su S F, Chuang C C, Liu K H, Applied Soft Computing, 8, pp. 55-78, (2008); Lam A Y, Li V O, IEEE transactions on evolutionary computation, 14, pp. 381-399, (2009); Kumar M, EXCLI J, 14, pp. 1232-1255, (2015); Zemali E A, Boukra A, 2016 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT), pp. 108-113, (2016); Kumar M, Om H, A Hybrid Bio-Inspired Algorithm for Protein Domain Problems, pp. 291-311, (2019); Thompson J D, Koehl P, Ripp R, Poch O, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, 61, pp. 127-136, (2005)","M.K.

In a planning context, this triggers the need for an evacuation situation that involves the emergency route planning (ERP) problem. ERP emphasizes the effectiveness of the evacuation plan to mitigate risk and ensure crowd safety. Reviews on previous ERP works have elicited a plethora of approaches, such as decision support, exact, heuristic, and meta-heuristic approaches. However, previous works on ERP focused on either crowd modeling techniques or routing approaches, but not both. This elicits the need to bridge modeling and routing approaches by means of a dynamic concept. To capture this dynamism concept, group cohesiveness and flexible routing approaches have been proposed, namely as an integrated evacuation planning with dynamism (iEvaP+). Group cohesiveness is utilized by considering group structure and intra-group compliance. Meanwhile, an artificial immune system (AIS) algorithm is adopted as the route optimizer. The iEvaP+ approach is applied to three case studies in order to identify the impact of crowd dynamism in the ERP problem. The result indicates that dynamism has direct influence on the evacuation plan performance. Besides the group cohesiveness, the properties of the evacuation network (such as exit) are also important in mitigating risks and crowd survivability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial immune system; Dynamic crowd evacuation; Emergency evacuation; Emergency route planning problem","Decision support systems; Heuristic methods; Artificial Immune System; Artificial immune system algorithms; Crowd evacuation; Decision supports; Emergency evacuation; Emergency route; Evacuation planning; Meta-heuristic approach; algorithm; Article; crowd evacuation; decision making; disaster planning; emergency route planning; human; priority journal; risk assessment; safety procedure; Immune system","","","","","Foundation for Fundamental Research on  Matter, FOM, (203/PKOMP/6711463); Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","The authors wish to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for the support it has extended in the completion of the present research through the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (203/PKOMP/6711463).

With respect to the problem mentioned previously, a content based mobile recipe application is proposed and tested in this paper. The main objective of this proposed application is to suggest a user preferred recipe using content-based filtering algorithm. Content-based filtering algorithm (CBFA) will be applied to identify the recipes that have high possibility for user to like. This algorithm will be able to recommend recipes based on user interaction. The algorithm will consider a few attributes to identify the similarity between the recipe pages viewed by the user. The reason to choose this algorithm is because it does not have the cold-start problem and it solely depends on the active user to identify their preferences. An Android based mobile recipe application is built to test this algorithm. The results from the experiment conducted show that the proposed algorithm is effective for recommending preferred recipes to user. © 2014 IEEE.","Content-based Filtering Algorithm; Mobile Application","Signal filtering and prediction; Software engineering; Starting; Cold start problems; Content based filtering; Content-based; Cooking recipe; Demographic information; Food preference; Mobile applications; User interaction; Cooking","","","","","","","Van Pinxteren Y., Geleijnse G., Kamsteeg P., A User-centered Approach to Define A Content-based Recipe Similarity Measure, (2010); Li Q., Kim B.M., Constructing user profiles for collaborative recommender system, Advanced Web Technologies and Applications, pp. 100-110, (2004); Schafer J.B., Frankowski D., Herlocker J., Sen S., Collaborative filtering recommender systems, The Adaptive Web, pp. 291-324, (2007); Pazzani M.J., Billsus D., Content-based recommendation systems, The Adaptive Web, pp. 325-341, (2007); Lops P., De Gemmis M., Semeraro G., Content-based recommender systems: State of the art and trends, Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 73-105, (2011); Rajaraman A., Ullman J.D., Mining of Massive Datasets, (2011); Ramadoss C., Recipe Recommendation.""; De Pessemier T., Dooms S., Martens L., A food recommender for patients in a care facility, Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems.

Nevertheless such websites are sometimes not updated, do not provide required information or the worst case they are abandoned despite the fact that software developers have fulfilled the requirements of the users, and the systems have been deployed successfully. Hence, such websites require a dynamic web design that can delegate responsibility to each staff in ensuring the contents are always updated either to be shared among the staff or the public. This paper proposes an approach called EPISoDe that directly integrates organisations' policies as part of functional requirements in software development in this case we focus on website design and its implementation of higher learning institutions. We have deployed the proposed EPISoDe approach in a prototype called DyWeMS that provides an engine of a dynamic web design. We evaluated the approach on an official website of a school in a higher learning institution using DyWeMS dynamic engine. It implies that an organisational official website has the potential to be a one-stop information and knowledge centre that reflects organisations' history and legacy using the proposed EPISoDe approach that promotes delegation of responsibilities among the staff with the support of dynamic web design. © 2011 IEEE.","Dynamic Web Design; Official Websites; Organisations' Policy; Software Development","Computer science; Computer software; Design; Gateways (computer networks); Information science; Societies and institutions; User interfaces; Websites; Functional requirement; Higher learning; Integrated approach; Official Websites; One stop; Organisations' Policy; Software developer; Web designs; Web site design; Worst case; Software design","","","","","","","Sulaiman S., Yusof U.K., Sulaiman S., A method to integrate Organisations' policies into web design, The Fourth Malaysian Software Engineering Conference (MySEC'08), pp. 307-312, (2008); He Q., Otto P., Anton A.I., Jones L., Ensuring compliance between policies, requirements and software design: A case study, Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Information Assurance (IWIA'06), (2006); Ong C.-S., Lai J.-Y., Wang Y.-M., Wang S.-W., An understanding of power issues influencing employees' acceptance of KMS: An empirical study of Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing companies, Proceedings of the 38th Annual Hawaii International Conference (HICSS'05), pp. 1-10, (2005); Hall H., Input-friendliness: Motivating knowledge sharing across intranets, Journal of Information Science, 27, 3, pp. 139-146, (2001); Hall H., Goody M., KM, culture and compromise: Interventions to promote knowledge sharing supported by technology in corporate environments, Journal of Information Science, 33, 2, pp. 181-188, (2007); Gillies J.S., Cultural obstacles to a successful KM initiative in large law firms, KMWorld & Intranets 2005 Conferences & Exposition, (2005); Moore J.W., The Road Map to Software Engineering: A Standardsbased Guide; Webometrics; Mambo CMS Latest Release; Joomla CMS","S.

Various emotions are observed during emergency such as panic, fear, sad and anxiety which will lead to the behaviour and trajectories during the evacuation. Even there are many studies of computational simulation model which focus on crowd behavioural, yet there are still gaps of real evacuation due to the scarcity of real data and mostly assumption is made on the simulated model. In this paper, investigation on how the key emotions turn into behaviour are studied from the real emergency video. The key emotions extracted are panic and confuse which is observed from the real emergency video. These emotions are then map to psychological theories adopt from Lazarus Theory of emotions and stress. Due to the uncertainties in human behaviour, fuzzy approach is chosen to map linguistic value to speed (numerical) which will then lead to behavioural results. The simulation results show that the inclusion of emotions via fuzzy rules has resulted 63.14% accuracy compare to non-fuzzy 56.01% to real emergency trajectories data. © 2019 International Center for Scientific Research and Studies.","Crowd behaviour; Emergencies evacuation; Emotions","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors wish to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for the support it has extended in the completion of the present research","Krausz B., Bauckhage C., Automatic video analysis of a crowd disaster, Loveparade 2010, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 116, 3, pp. 307-319, (2012); Bosse T., Hoogendoorn M., Klein M.C., Treur J., Van Der Wal C.N., Van Wissen A., Modelling collective decision making in groups and crowds: (2013).

The most common online learning theory used in determining the learning style is the Felder-Silvermans Theory. Many researchers have proposed machine learning algorithms to establish learning style by using log file attributes. However, they did not optimize the parameters selections which also contribute to low performance matrices. In this paper, tree-based algorithm is being used to detect the learning style of the user. The tree-based algorithms used in this paper are the Decision Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgb). In order to optimize the results of the performance matrices, the parameters of the tree-based algorithm classifiers are optimized by using the grid search hyper-parameter optimization.

Besides textual representation for diverse expertise levels, graphical visualisation will be able to support the requirements in searching and representing expertise level among e-community. There is a number of existing SIG portals available. However, they do not visualise effectively and accurately the expertise level of members and make it difficult for users to search their targeted experts for instance searching the highest expertise level to have a discussion and to solve their problems related to a project.

The hyperparameter in the feature-extraction phase was configured based on the learning rate and momentum and further improved based on the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) optimizer and the function reducing-learning-rate-on-plateau to optimize the model's training scheme. The optimized YOLOv5s achieved a better performance, with a mean average precision of 98.6% and a high inference speed of 106 frames per second. The ADAM optimizer with a detailed learning rate (0.0001) and momentum (0.99) fine-tuning yielded a sufficient convergence rate (0.69% at 55th epoch) to assist YOLOv5s in attaining a more precise detection for underwater objects. © 2013 IEEE.","Image processing speed; object recognition; optimization model; tuning hyper-parameter; underwater imaging","Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Object detection; Object recognition; Computational modelling; Features extraction; Hyper-parameter; Image processing speed; Images processing; Objects recognition; Optimization models; Processing speed; Tuning; Tuning hyper-parameter; Computer architecture","","","","","Cawangan Pulau Pinang; Institute of Management Research, College of Business Administration Seoul National University; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/TK04/UITM/02/19); Universiti Teknologi MARA, UiTM","This work was supported in part by the Grants from the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE), Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), under Grant FRGS/1/2019/TK04/UITM/02/19; in part by the Research Management Institute; and in part by Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Cawangan Pulau Pinang.","Kechiche L., Touil L., Ouni B., Real-time image and video processing: Method and architecture, Proc. 2nd Int.

However, the advancement of high throughput technologies results in high dimensional malware data, making feature selection useful and mandatory in such datasets. The feature selection technique is an information retrieval tool that aims to improve classifiers by listing important features, which also aids in reducing computational overload. However, different feature selection algorithms select representative features using various criteria, making it difficult to determine the optimal technique for distinct domain datasets. Ensemble feature selection approaches, which integrate the results of several feature selections, can be used to overcome the inadequacies of single-feature selection methods. Therefore, this paper attempts to determine whether the heterogeneous ensemble of filter and embedded feature selection approaches, namely the heterogenous ensemble of ANOVA F-test, ReliefF, L1-penalized logistic regression, LASSO regression, Extra-Tree Classifier and XGBoost feature selection techniques, namely HEFS-ARLLEX, can provide a better classification performance than the single feature selection technique and other ensemble feature selection approaches for malware classification data. The experimental results show that HEFS-ARLLEX, which combines both filters and embedded, is a better choice, providing consistently high classification accuracy, recall, precision, specificity and F-measure and a reasonable feature reduction rate for malware classification dataset. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Embedded Approach; Ensemble Feature Selection; Filter Approach; High-Dimensional Data; Malware Classification","Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Learning algorithms; Logistic regression; Malware; Embedded approach; Embedded feature selections; Ensemble feature selections; Features selection; Filter approach; High dimensional data; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Malware classifications; Selection techniques; Feature Selection","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (:304/PKOMP/6501300/M188)","Funding text 1: ∗This material is based on work supported by, or in part by, the Micron Memory Malaysia Sdn.

The situation demands a need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of capacity planning and resource optimization while still maintaining their flexibilities. Machine loading - one of the important components of capacity planning is known for its complexity that encompasses various types of flexibilities pertaining to part selection, machine and operation assignment along with constraints. Various studies are done to balance the productivity and flexibility in flexible manufacturing system (FMS). From the literature, researchers have developed many approaches to reach a suitable balance of exploration (global improvement) and exploitation (local improvement). We adopt a hybrid of population approaches; hybrid constraint-chromosome genetic algorithm and harmony search algorithm (H-CCGaHs), to solve this problem that aims at mapping a feasible solution to the domain problem. The objectives are to minimize the system unbalance as well as to increase the throughput while satisfying the constraints such as machine time availability and tool slots. The proposed algorithm is tested for its performance on 10 sample problems available in FMS literature and compared with existing solution approaches. © 2014, IJICIC Editorial Office.

However, the success rate of IVF is still relatively low (38%). A critical factor that influences the success of IVF is the quality of the embryo. The most viable embryo would be chosen to be transferred based on the morphology or appearance of the embryo. Embryologist would have to observe the morphology of embryo before selecting the most viable embryo to be transferred into woman uterus. There are two types of embryo assessment based on morphology, traditional morphology assessment and time-lapse imaging. In traditional morphology assessment, embryologists observe and evaluate the embryo based on grading system available. Meanwhile, in time-lapse imaging, embryo assessment could be done without disturbing embryo culture. Evaluation of the embryos using traditional morphological evaluation and time-lapse were still subjective. Researchers are trying to integrate machine learning into the IVF procedure to increase its success rate. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize the available literature regarding the use of morphology for the selection of viable embryo in IVF using machine learning. © Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan (ZUJ).","Embryo selection; IVF; Machine learning; Morphology; Time-lapse monitoring","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors wish to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for the support it has extended in the completion of the present research.","Zegers-Hochschild F., Adamson G., de Mouzon J., Ishihara O., Mansour R., Nygren K., Sullivan E., van derPoel S., The International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technology (ICMART) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Revised Glossary on ART Terminology, 2009, Human Reproduction, 24, 11, pp. 2683-2687, (2009); Sengul Y., Bener A., Uyar A., Emerging technologies for improving embryo selection: a systematic review, Advanced Health Care Technologies, 1, pp. 55-64, (2015); Cutting R., Single embryo transfer for all, Best Practice & Research Clinical Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 53, pp. 30-37, (2018); Pandian Z., Templeton A., Serour G., Bhattacharya S., Number of embryos for transfer after IVF and ICSI: a Cochrane review, Human Reproduction, 20, pp. 2681-2687, (2005); Pribenszky C., Nilselid A.

Thus any new diagnostic tests must undergo a thorough evaluation. New diagnostic tests are evaluated in comparison with the respective gold standard tests. The performance of binary diagnostic tests is quantified by accuracy measures, with sensitivity and specificity being the most important measures. In any diagnostic accuracy study, the estimates of these measures are often biased owing to selective verification of the patients, which is referred to as partial verification bias. Several methods for correcting partial verification bias are available depending on the scale of the index test, target outcome, and missing data mechanism. However, these are not easily accessible to the researchers due to the complexity of the methods. This article aims to provide a brief overview of the methods available to correct for partial verification bias involving a binary diagnostic test and provide a practical tutorial on how to implement the methods using the statistical programming language R. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","accuracy measure; application in R; correction method; diagnostic test; partial verification bias","Bias; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Humans; Sensitivity and Specificity; adult; article; computer language; diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; gold standard; human; medical care; quantitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; diagnostic test; statistical bias","","","","","School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia","We thank our colleagues at the School of Computer Sciences and the School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia for the comments on this article's draft and the PVBcorrect R package.

Hence, consider as a two objective optimisation problem. Moreover, most of the existing work treats FS as single-objective by combining the two aims into a single fitness function. As such, there is a trade-off between the number of selected features and classification performance. To create a balance between the conflicting aim of the FS and yet improve classification performance, this study proposes the use of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm NSGAIII. Filter-based FS are scalable to large dimensional datasets and computationally fast. However, their classification performance is low because they lack feature interaction among the selected subset of features. Based on that mutual information (MI) along with entropy, are proposed as a filter-based evaluation measure along with the NSGAIII to have NSGAIIIMI and NSGAIIIE. The results obtained was compared with the existing single-objective, NSGAII as well as strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm with both MI and entropy. NSGAIII can successfully evolve the set of nondominated solutions and performs better in terms of the number of selected features, classification error rate and computational time on the majority of the datasets. © 2020 IEEE.","Entropy; Feature Selection; Filter-Based; Multi-Objective Optimization; Mutual Information; NSGAII; NSGAIII","Economic and social effects; Entropy; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Large dataset; Classification error rate; Classification performance; Evaluation measures; Feature interactions; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Nondominated solutions; Objective optimisation; Strength pareto evolutionary algorithm; Classification (of information)","","","","","Woosong University; Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8014084)","The authors want to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for supporting and backing the research via its Research University Grant (1001/PKOMP/8014084) together with Endicott College of International Studies (ECIS), Woosong University, Korea.","Xue Z.B., Browne W.N.M., Yao.

With the advent of Artificial intelligence (AI), recently, deep learning techniques have been used effectively in breast cancer detection, facilitating early diagnosis and therefore increasing the chances of patients’ survival. Compared to classical machine learning techniques, deep learning requires less human intervention for similar feature extraction. This study presents a systematic literature review on the deep learning-based methods for breast cancer detection that can guide practitioners and researchers in understanding the challenges and new trends in the field. Particularly, different deep learning-based methods for breast cancer detection are investigated, focusing on the genomics and histopathological imaging data. The study specifically adopts the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), which offer a detailed analysis and synthesis of the published articles. Several studies were searched and gathered, and after the eligibility screening and quality evaluation, 98 articles were identified. The results of the review indicated that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the most accurate and extensively used model for breast cancer detection, and the accuracy metrics are the most popular method used for performance evaluation. Moreover, datasets utilized for breast cancer detection and the evaluation metrics are also studied. Finally, the challenges and future research direction in breast cancer detection based on deep learning models are also investigated to help researchers and practitioners acquire in-depth knowledge of and insight into the area. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial neural network; breast cancer; breast cancer diagnosis; cancer detection; deep learning","artificial neural network; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; genomics; histopathology; human; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; Review; systematic review","","","","","School of Computer Sciences; Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","This research was funded by the Research Creativity and Management Office (RCMO), and the School of Computer Sciences at the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).","Aggarwal R., Sounderajah V., Martin G., Ting D.S.W., Karthikesalingam A., King D., Ashrafian H., Darzi A., Diagnostic accuracy of deep learning in medical imaging: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Npj Digit.

Feature selection (FS) is one of the most commonly used dimensionalities that reduces the unwanted features from the datasets. FS can be either wrapper or filter. Wrappers select subsets of the feature with better classification performance but are computationally expensive. On the other hand, filters are computationally fast but lack feature interaction among selected subsets of features which in turn affect the classification performance of the chosen subsets of features. This study proposes two concepts of information theory mutual information (MI). As well as entropy (E). Both were used together with binary cuckoo optimization algorithm BCOA (BCOA-MI and BCOA-EI). The target is to improve classification performance (reduce the error rate and computational complexity) on eight datasets with varying degrees of complexity. A support vector machine classifier was used to measure and computes the error rates of each of the datasets for both BCOA-MI and BCOA-E. The analysis of the results showed that BCOAE selects a fewer number of features and performed better in terms of error rate. In contrast, BCOAMI is computationally faster but chooses a larger number of features. Comparison with other methods found in the literature shows that the proposed BCOA-MI and BCOA-E performed better in terms of accuracy, the number of selected features, and execution time in most of the datasets.

Different methods have been developed to measure the similarity of molecules to a target query. Although the approaches perform effectively, particularly when dealing with molecules with homogenous active structures, they fall short when dealing with compounds that have heterogeneous structural compounds. In recent times, deep learning methods have been exploited for improving the performance of molecule searching due to their feature extraction power and generalization capabilities. However, despite numerous research studies on deep-learning-based molecular similarity searches, relatively few secondary research was carried out in the area. This research aims to provide a systematic literature review (SLR) on deep-learning-based molecular similarity searches to enable researchers and practitioners to better understand the current trends and issues in the field. The study accesses 875 distinctive papers from the selected journals and conferences, which were published over the last thirteen years (2010–2023). After the full-text eligibility analysis and careful screening of the abstract, 65 studies were selected for our SLR. The review’s findings showed that the multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and autoencoders (AEs) are the most frequently used deep learning models for molecular similarity searching; next are the models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) techniques. The ChEMBL dataset and DrugBank standard dataset are the two datasets that are most frequently used for the evaluation of deep learning methods for molecular similarity searching based on the results. In addition, the results show that the most popular methods for optimizing the performance of molecular similarity searching are new representation approaches and reweighing features techniques, and, for evaluating the efficiency of deep-learning-based molecular similarity searching, the most widely used metrics are the area under the curve (AUC) and precision measures. © 2023 by the authors.","deep learning; drug design; drug discovery; molecular similarity searching; virtual screening","","","","","","School of Computer Sciences; Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","This research was funded by the Research Creativity and Management Office (RCMO) and the School of Computer Sciences at the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).","Bero S.A., Muda A.K., Choo Y.H., Muda N.A., Pratama S.F., Similarity Measure for Molecular Structure: A Brief Review, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Mathematics (ICCSCM); Carhart R.E., Smith D.H., Venkataraghavan R., Atom pairs as molecular features in structure-activity studies: Definition and applications, J.

Based on that, FS is considered as a two objectives minimisation problem. FS can be filter-based or wrapper-based reliant on its assessment conditions. In the wrapper-based approach, each subset of features are evaluated, and the one with least error rate is selected. However, this process is computationally tricky for a dataset with many features. Majority of the previous work treats FS as a one objective by joining both error rate and the number of selected features in a single fitness function. To create a balance between the error rate and the number of selected features, and consequently improve the computational cost. This study proposes the use of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms, along with binary cuckoo optimisation algorithm, BCOA (BCOA-NSGA3). The results show that the proposed methods exhibit promising results and can successfully develops a set of non-dominated solutions with a reduced error rate and less computational cost compared with the single-objective and other related works, with BCOA-NSGA3 been the best of all on the majority of the datasets. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Binary cuckoo optimisation algorithm; Multi-objective feature selection; NSGA-II; NSGA-III; Wrapper-based","","","","","","","","Alpaydin E., Introduction to Machine Learning, (2014); Deb K., Jain H., An evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm using reference-point-based nondominated sorting approach, part I: Solving problems with box constraints, IEEE Trans.

However, focus on an effective search program is insufficient to give the “taste” of actual entertainment in the gaming industry. Instead of focusing on effective search algorithm, we dedicate our study in realizing the possibility of applying strategy changing technique. However, quantifying and determining this possibility is the main challenge imposed in this study. For this purpose, the Conspiracy Number Search algorithm is considered where the maximum and minimum conspiracy numbers are recorded in the test bed of simple Tic-Tac-Toe and Othello game application. We analysed these numbers as the measures of critical position identifier which determines the right moment for possibility of applying strategy changing technique. For Tic-Tac-Toe game, the conspiracy numbers are analysed through operators formally defined in this article as ↑ tactic and ↓ tactic while variance of the conspiracy numbers are analysed in Othello game. Interesting results are obtained with convincing evidences but future works are still needed in order to further strengthen our hypothesis. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Conspiracy numbers; Othello; Tic-Tac-Toe","Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Conspiracy numbers; Critical positions; Othello; Perfect informations; Search Algorithms; Tic-Tac-Toe; Tic-Tac-Toe game; Computer games","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (number26540189)","This research is funded by a grant from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, in the framework of the Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Exploratory Research (grant number26540189).","van den Herik H.J., Donkers H., Spronck P.H., Opponent modelling and commercial games, Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG05), pp. 15-25, (2005); Iida H., Uiterwijk J., van den Herik H.J., Herschberg I., Potential applications of opponent-model search: Part 1, The domain of applicability.

The common lead time estimation mostly applied with knowledge-based approaches, but most of them have focused on supervised regression task to predict continuous lead time, which somehow only predicts the product lead time without identifying the critical lengthy manufacturing process. This paper aims to predict the manufacturing lead time of a product with supervised machine learning approach through classification of lead time in time range duration and able to identify the lengthy manufacturing product lead time. The machine learning model are developed with support vector machine algorithm using production and work order data as the model input. The target class is the total duration of product manufacturing time discretized into category attribute with different range of duration. The dataset extracted from work order and production data source and merge into a full dataset. Data preprocessing and feature engineering were applied to clean the dataset and boost the feature set to have 81 features in total. The final feature set was selected using recursive feature elimination approach feature selection technique. The final model applied support vector machine algorithm to perform the classification task and compared with Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network for performance. The final model scored 84.62% of weighted accuracy and able to predict the over-time class with over 65% of accuracy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Classification; Discretization; Machine learning; Manufacturing lead time classification; Recursive feature elimination; Support vector machine","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Engineering education; Forecasting; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; Manufacture; Neural networks; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Vectors; Discretizations; Efficiency and performance; Knowledge-based approach; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing lead-time; Recursive feature elimination; Supervised machine learning; Support vector machine algorithm; Machine learning","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8014084)","Acknowledgment.

According to a prior study, the day 3 embryo development stage is a crucial transitional time that significantly impacts the pregnancy and implantation rates of day 5 transfers. Most embryologists currently analyze the morphological characteristics of day 3 embryos visually using a microscope, which is subjective and time-consuming. This study aims to develop a CNN model capable of classifying embryo grades on day 3 based on their morphological characteristics using transfer learning. As a result, it automates the grading procedure. Four image preprocessing techniques, including data vectorization, image resizing, image normalization, and data augmentation, have been shown to improve image features. This project compares ResNet50 and Xception, two pre-trained CNN models. Analysis of the experiment's results reveals that data augmentation can address the imbalanced data issue and increase the data set. Transfer learning using a feature extraction technique outperforms fine-tuning substantially. The Xception model performed better than ResNet50 in classifying the grade of day 3 embryos based on morphological characteristics, with a 98.00% score across all evaluation metrics and the lowest loss value of 0.101. © 2023 IEEE.","CNN; day 3 embryo; IVF; transfer learning","Image enhancement; Learning systems; Assisted reproductive technologies; CNN models; Data augmentation; Day 3 embryo; In-vitro; In-vitro fertilization; Learning techniques; Morphological characteristic; Transfer learning; Vitro fertilization; Grading","","","","","","","Infertility, (2021); Edrus E.D., When should we seek a fertility specialist?, (2022); Carson S.A., Kallen A.N., Diagnosis and management of infertility, JAMA, 326, 1, (2021); Rad R.M., Saeedi P., Au J., Havelock J., Trophectoderm segmentation in human embryo images via inceptioned U-Net, Medical Image Analysis, 62, (2020); Islam A.M.R.G., Gahlot K., Khan N., IN vitro fertilization, Journal of Biological & Scientific Opinion, 1, 4, pp. 398-402, (2013); Isa I.S., Yusof U.K., Zain M.M., Image processing approach for grading ivf blastocyst: A state-of-The-art review and future perspective of deep learning-based models, Applied Sciences, 13, 2, (2023); Nasiri N., Eftekhari-Yazdi P., An overview of the available methods for morphological scoring of pre-implantation embryos in in vitro fertilization, Cell journal, 16, 4, pp. 392-405, (2015); Desai N.N., Morphological evaluation of human embryos and derivation of an embryo quality scoring system specific for day 3 embryos: A preliminary study, Human Reproduction, 15, 10, pp. 2190-2196, (2000); Coskun S., Hollanders J., Al-Hassan S., Al-Sufyan H., Al-Mayman H., Jaroudi K., Day 5 versus day 3 embryo transfer: A controlled randomized trial, Human Reproduction, 15, 9, pp. 1947-1952, (2000); Racowsky C., Stern J.E., Gibbons W.E., Behr B., Pomeroy K.O., Biggers J.D., National collection of embryo morphology data into society for assisted reproductive technology clinic outcomes reporting system: Associations among day 3 cell number, fragmentation and blastomere asymmetry, and live birth rate, Fertility and Sterility, 95, 6, pp. 1985-1989, (2011); Cutting R., Morroll D., Roberts S.A., Pickering S., Rutherford A., Elective single embryo transfer: Guidelines for practice british fertility society and association of clinical embryologists, Human Fertility, 11, 3, pp. 131-146, (2008); Zeman A., Maerten A.-S., Mengels A., Sharon L.F., Spiessens C., De Beeck H.O., Deep learning for human embryo classification at the cleavage stage (day 3), Pattern Recognition.

With the increasing number of DR cases, diabetic eye screening is a challenging task for experts. Adopting machine learning to create a high accuracy classifier will be able to reduce the burden of diabetic eye screening. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a high accuracy DR classifier using clinical attributes. This study was conducted using nine clinical attributes of 385 diabetic patients, who were already labelled regarding DR, where 79 patients did not suffer from DR (NODR), 161 patients had nonproliferative DR (NPDR), and 145 patients had proliferative DR (PDR). The data was then used to develop a DR classifier through the hybrid of optimised Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experiment results showed that the hybrid classifier had a high accuracy of 94.55. The accuracy yield was higher compared to single classifier. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Classification; Diabetic Retinopathy; Hybridisation; Neural Network; Support Vector Machine","Diagnosis; Eye protection; Support vector machines; Diabetic patient; Diabetic retinopathy; High-accuracy; Hybrid classifier; Hybridisation; Neural networks","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (203/PKOMP/6711802)","Acknowledgement.

Feature selection (FS) is a typical dimensionality reduction that is used to reduce the unwanted features from the datasets. FS can be either filter or wrapper. Filters lack interaction among selected subsets of features which in turns affect the classification performance of the chosen subsets of features. This study proposes two ideas of information theory entropy (E) as well as mutual information (MI). Both of them were used together with binary cuckoo optimisation algorithm BCOA (BCOA-E and BCOA-MI) to reduce both the error rate and computational complexity on four different datasets. A support vector machine classifier was used to measure the error rates. The results are in favour of BCOA-E in terms of accuracy. In contrast, BCOA-MI is computationally faster than BCOA-E. Comparison with other approaches found in the literature shows that the proposed methods performed better in terms of accuracy, number of selected features and execution time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Binary Cuckoo optimisation; Feature selection; Filter-based; Information theory","Data mining; Dimensionality reduction; Filtration; Information theory; Optimization; Support vector machines; Classification performance; Data mining process; Error rate; Filter-based; Mutual informations; Optimisations; Support vector machine classifiers; Feature extraction","","","","","Univer-siti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8014084); Woosong University","Acknowledgement.

ERP is more than a software package; it includes the efforts and activities to integrate internal and external management information, business process automation and reengineering, and organisation structure streamlining. Thus, ERP eventually leads to an efficient and competitive business. Despite the prominence of ERP systems, approximately three-quarters of ERP projects are deemed as failures. Most failures are attributed to the misfit between pre-loaded business models in the ERP system and business requirements in the real world. This paper introduces a framework to classify ERP misfits into logical categories that provide insights for solution derivation. Subsequently, the classification methods are applied to a case study. Practitioners can use the misfit classification method to derive corresponding actions as solutions for ERP misfits based on their nature or specificity. In addition, the theoretical contribution of the ERP misfit problem is explored to provide information for researchers to determine appropriate theories and concepts explaining this domain. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2011.","Business information system;

Instead of focusing on effective search algorithm, we dedicate our study in realizing the possibility of applying speculative play. However, quantifying and determining this possibility is the main challenge imposed in this study. For this purpose, the Conspiracy Number Search algorithm is considered where the maximum and minimum conspiracy numbers are recorded in the test bed of a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game application. We analyze these numbers as the measures of critical position identifier which determines the right moment for possibility of applying speculative play through operators formally defined in this article as ↑ tactic and ↓ tactic. Interesting results are obtained with convincing evidences but further works are still needed in order to prove our hypothesis.","Critical position; Games; Speculative play","Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Critical positions; Further works; Games; ITS applications; Perfect informations; Search Algorithms; Speculative play; Tic-Tac-Toe game; Computer games","","","","","","","Allis L.V., Van Der Meulen M., Van Den Herik H.J., Proof-number search, Artificial Intelligence, 66, 1, pp. 91-124, (1994); Buro M., From simple features to sophisticated evaluation functions, Computers and Games, pp. 126-145, (1999); Carmel D., Markovitch S., Learning Models of Opponent's Strategy in Game Playing, (1993); Donkers J., Nosce Hostem: Searching with Opponent Models, (2003); Elkan C., Conspiracy numbers and caching for searching and/or trees and theorem-proving, IJCAI, pp. 341-348, (1989); Iida H., Uiterwijk J., Herik H.J.V.D., Herschberg I., Potential applications of opponent-model search: Part 1 the domain of applicability, ICCA Journal, 16, 4, pp. 201-208, (1993); Iida H., Uiterwijk J., Herik H.J.V.D., Herschberg I., Potential applications of opponent-model search.

In facts, requirement engineering is important to get all the requirements needed for an expert system. If the requirements do not meet the clients' needs, the expert system is considered fail although it works perfectly. Currently, there are a lot of studies proposing and describing the development of expert systems. However, they are focusing in a specific and narrow domain of problems. Also, the major concern of most researchers is the design issues of the expert system. Therefore, we emphasize on the very first step of success expert system development requirement engineering. Hence, we are focusing in the requirement engineering techniques in order to present the most practical way to facilitate requirement engineering processes. In this paper, we analyze expert system attributes, requirement engineering processes in expert system developments and the possible techniques that can be applied to expert system developments. Next, we propose the most appropriate techniques for the expert system developments based on the analysis.

The situation presents a need to optimize the machine utilization while still maintaining its flexibilities. Machine allocation is known for its complexity that encompasses various types of flexibilities pertaining to part selection, machine and operation assignment along with the constraints. The objectives of this work are to minimize the system unbalance and to increase throughput while satisfying the technological constraints. A new model, a hybrid of genetic algorithm and harmony search, slightly modified to suit the machine constraints was proposed and tested on industrial datasets to examine its effectiveness.

The objective of this strategy is to produce optimum maintenance times for system components. The island model is used to divide the total population into smaller sub populations, where for each island, a harmony search is used to find the optimal maintenance cost. To test the system, a data set for maintenance based on replacement policy was used. The test results from the data set were compared to those obtained from a general gradient with branch and bound (GRG with BB), simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA).

As such, optimizing the evacuation operations during an emergency situation would require an effective crowd evacuation plan, which is acknowledged to be one of the vital studies of the societal research as well as emergency route planning (ERP) community. Several descriptions of prior developed approaches for emergency evacuation that encompassed the needs of a variety of public community as well as fulfilling the complexity of the situation, are summed up and discussed. This paper introduces an immune algorithm (IA) to optimize the evacuation plan for solving the ERP problems. The approach is first validated against previous work while further experimentation reveals the effectiveness of the proposed IA, with regard to certain parameter calibrations, in the context of ERP problems. The findings have been summarized and presented, whereas the potential for future work is identified.","Emergency evacuation; Emergency route planning; Immune algorithm","Oil spills; Artificial immune; Emergency evacuation; Emergency evacuation route planning; Emergency route; Emergency situation; Immune algorithms; Parameter calibration; Public communities; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Alsnih R., Stopher P.R., Review of procedures associated with devising emergency evacuation plans, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1865, 1, pp. 89-97, (2004); Bagheri A., Zandieh M., Mahdavi I., Yazdani M., An artificial immune algorithm for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem, Future Generation Computer Systems, 26, 4, pp. 533-541, (2010); Carron A.V., Brawley L.R., Cohesion conceptual and measurement issues, Small Group Research, 31, 1, pp. 89-106, (2000); Cepolina E.M., A methodology for defining building evacuation routes, Civil Engineering and Environmental Systems, 22, 1, pp. 29-47, (2005); Dasgupta D., Yu S., Nino F., Recent advances in artificial immune systems: Models and applications, Applied Soft Computing, 11, 2, pp. 1574-1587, (2011); Hajibabai L., Delavar M., Malek M., Frank A., Agent-based simulation of spatial cognition and wayfinding in building fire emergency evacuation, Geomatics Solutions for Disaster Management, pp. 255-270, (2007); Hui F., Zi Z., Gang H., Developing a model for the emergency rescue routing problem using stochastic programming theory, Logistics Engineering and Intelligent Transportation Systems (LEITS), 2010 International Conference on, pp. 1-4, (2010); Kim S., George B., Shekhar S., Evacuation route planning: Scalable heuristics, Proceedings of the 15th Annual ACM International Symposium on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, (2007); Li Q., Fang Z., Li Q., Zong X., Multiobjective evacuation route assignment model based on genetic algorithm, Geoinformatics, 2010 18th International Conference on, pp. 1-5, (2010); Lu Q., Huang Y., Shekhar S., Evacuation planning: A capacity constrained routing approach, Intelligence and Security Informatics, pp. 111-125, (2003); Lv Y., Huang G., Sun W., Chao D., A scenario-based modeling approach for emergency evacuation management and risk analysis under multiple uncertainties, Journal of Hazardous Materials, (2012); Sayyady F., Eksioglu S.D., Optimizing the use of public transit system during no-notice evacuation of urban areas, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 59, 4, pp. 488-495, (2010); Wang P., Luh P.B., Chang S.-C., Sun J., Modeling and optimization of crowd guidance for building emergency evacuation, Automation Science and Engineering, 2008.

In order to mitigate the probable risks, emergency routes need to be properly planned and managed. As such, this has prompted crowd guidance as one of the main solutions for emergency route planning and management. Optimization algorithms have been an essential part of any crowd guidance. Trends of the optimization algorithms have been thoroughly reviewed based on the three components of emergency route planning and management: network or route (resource), affected crowd (demand), and critical event (disaster). Various optimization algorithms have been developed and implemented ranging from mathematical, decision support system, heuristics, meta-heuristics, and others. The review has revealed that most optimization algorithms lack several features which are vital in an emergency evacuation problem, enabling it to be scalable, practical, and reliable. Additionally, limitations of the existing optimization algorithms in the context of emergency route planning and management have also been identified based on the three aforementioned components. Future outlooks for crowd guidance solution in the field of emergency route planning and management are discussed and presented. © 2015, ICIC International.","Algorithms; Emergency evacuation; Route planning and management","Artificial intelligence;

However, in real-world applications, the multi-view data are often noisy because of various environmental factors. The key challenge of graph-based multi-view clustering is obtaining a consistent clustering structure. Most graph-based methods learn independently in one view how similar the data points in each view are to one another. However, the consistency of information in a multi-view dataset is easily overlooked, causing an unsatisfactory unified graph matrix. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel self-weighted graph-based framework for multi-view clustering (SGMF). This framework integrates these initial similar graph matrices into a unified graph matrix by assigning different weights to the initial graphs of each view. This algorithm's goal is to effectively learn a unified graph matrix and eliminate noise or irrelevant information from the dataset. This is the first time a generalized multi-view framework based on the L1-norm has been proposed. L1-norm can be used to improve the robustness of the algorithm. Particularly, SGMF can automatically weigh each view's initial similar graph matrix to solve the noise problem and obtain a consistent data structure. Simultaneously, a rank constraint is imposed on the graph Laplacian matrix of the final unified matrix, which helps to automatically divide the data points into the appropriate number of clusters. The experimental results on synthetic and real datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over the latest baseline.  © 2013 IEEE.","Graph framework; L1-norm; multi-view clustering; rank constraint; unified graph matrix","Graphic methods; Laplace transforms; Linear programming; Matrix algebra; Noise pollution; Clustering methods; Graph framework; L1 norm; Linear-programming; matrix; Multi-view clustering; Rank constraints; Robustness; Sparse matrices; Unified graph matrix; Clustering algorithms","","","","","","","Huang S., Kang Z., Tsang I.W., Xu Z., Auto-weighted multi-view clustering via kernelized graph learning, Pattern Recognit, 88, pp. 174-184, (2019); Chen M.-S., Huang L., C.-D.wang, Huang D., Multi-view clustering in latent embedding space, Proc.

Time series models, particularly Deep Learning (DL) methods, have gained popularity in predicting demand and can potentially be used to predict demand for medical services, including outpatient hospital visits. This study aims to assess the potential of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model in accurately predicting outpatient visits. The proposed model was tested with different set of parameters. Two important parameters adjusted in this study which are batch size and number of hidden nodes. The study also compares the performance of Bi-LSTM with other LSTM architectures, such as Vanilla LSTM and Stack LSTM. The results obtained show that Bi-LSTM performs best with batch size 64 and 10 hidden neurons. Besides, the results yielded indicate that the Bi-LSTM model performs exceptionally well with higher accuracy compared to other LSTM architectures. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the use of Bi-LSTM models for predicting the number of outpatient visits.  © 2023 IEEE.","forecasting; healthcare; long short-term memory; outpatient; time series","Brain; Health care; Hospitals; Long short-term memory; Memory architecture; Time series; Batch sizes; Healthcare; Hospital visits; Memory modeling; Outpatient; Resources allocation; Service delivery; Service resources; Times series; Times series models; Forecasting","","","","","","","Jiang S., Chin K.-S., Wang L., Qu G., Tsui K.L., Modified genetic algorithm-based feature selection combined with pre-trained deep neural network for demand forecasting in outpatient department, Expert systems with applications, 82, pp. 216-230, (2017); Owad A.A., Islam M., Samaranayake P., Karim A., Relationships between patient flow problems, health care services, and patient satisfaction: An empirical investigation of the emergency department, Business Process Management Journal, 28, pp. 685-712, (2022); Phankokkruad M., Wacharawichanant S., An application of convolutional neural network-Long Short-Term Memory model for service demand forecasting, Int.

The importance of satisfying customer demands and achieving higher profits have increased the attention towards production scheduling in semiconductor assembly areas. Combination of productivity and flexibility provided by semiconductor assembly areas have attracted many research efforts for several years. Additionally, recent globalization events have encouraged decentralized efforts in the semiconductor assembly industry by implementing distributed systems. With respect to the previously mentioned problems, several approaches have been introduced namely Petri nets, Ant Colony, Genetic Algorithm, Intelligent Agents, and hybrids of the latter. A new model, using artificial immune system (AIS) algorithm, slightly modified to conform to the manufacturing constraints, has been proposed and tested with an industrial dataset to establish its effectiveness. AIS algorithm is chosen due to its inherent self-learning capability and memory incubation features. The results from the experiments conducted show that the proposed algorithm is effective for the aforementioned problems where the production schedule efficiency increased from 30% to 60%. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial immune system; distributed production scheduling; Semiconductor industry","Ant colony optimization; Genetic algorithms; Immune system; Intelligent agents; Petri nets; Production control; Scheduling; Semiconductor device manufacture; Systems analysis; Artificial Immune System; Artificial immune system algorithms; Distributed productions; Manufacturing constraint; Production Scheduling; Self-learning capability; Semiconductor assembly; Semiconductor industry; Assembly","","","","","","","Yusof U.K., Deris S., Budiarto R., Machine aUocation optimization in semiconductor assembly industry using a hybrid of bio-inspired and musical-harmony approach, The 7th International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control (ICICIC2012), (2013); Lee D.Y., Dicesare F., Scheduling flexible manufacturing systems using petri nets and heuristic search, Robotics and Automation, IEEE Transactions on, 10, 2, pp. 123-132, (1994); Prakash A., Khilwani N., Tiwari M., Cohen Y., Modified immune algorithm for job selection and operation allocation problem in flexible manufacturing systems, Advances in Engineering Software, 39, 3, pp. 219-232, (2008); Chan F., Chan H., Lau H., The state of the art in simulation study on fms scheduling: A comprehensive survey, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 19, 11, pp. 830-849, (2002); Reyes A., Yu H., Kelleher G., Lloyd S., Integrating petri nets and hybrid heuristic search for the scheduling of fms, Computers in Industry, 47, 1, pp. 123-138, (2002); Kumar R., Tiwari M., Shankar R., Scheduling of flexible manufacturing systems: An ant colony optimization approach, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering ManufaclUre, 217, 10, pp. 1443-1453, (2003); Jia H., Fuh J.Y., Nee A.Y., Zhang Y., Integration of genetic algorithm and gantt chart for job shop scheduling in distributed manufacturing systems, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 53, 2, pp. 313-320, (2007); Yadollahi M., Rahmani A.M., Solving distributed flexible manufacturing systems scheduling problems subject to maintenance: Memetic algorithms approach, Computer and Information Technology, 2009.

Planning a suitable evacuation route and identifying the shortest evacuation route before the occurrence of extreme events are crucial for an effective evacuation process. Although evacuation plans can be orchestrated in advance, probable crowd dynamics, especially group-based characteristics (e.g. group formation, group relation, group competition, etc.), may occur, rendering unfeasible evacuation plan. Therefore, creating a dynamic and effective emergency route planning (ERP) approach is important for crowd survivability. There are number of ERP approaches have been proposed, which includes mathematical-based approach, heuristic-driven approach, and meta-heuristic approach. Although the meta-heuristic approaches are capable of handling dynamic constraints and produces optimum result, its lack of adoption in the domain of ERP problem serve as an encouragement of applying this approach. Therefore, an integrated evacuation planning approach with dynamism (iEvaP+) is proposed to cater the dynamic of groups in crowd and optimizing the route selection, where the use of immune-based meta-heuristic approach had effectively produces statistically significant results (p-value < 0.5 significance level) against an approach proposed by [1]. © 2015 IEEE.","artificial immune system; crowd dynamic; crowd modeling; emergency evacuation; emergency route planning","Big data; Computer software; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Software engineering; Artificial Immune System; Crowd dynamics; Crowd modeling; Emergency evacuation; Emergency route; Optimization","","","","","","","Lu Q., Huang Y., Shekhar S., Evacuation planning: A capacity constrained routing approach, Intelligence and Security Informatics, pp. 111-125, (2003); Chiu Y.-C., Zheng H., Villalobos J., Gautam B., Modeling nonotice mass evacuation using a dynamic traffic flow optimization model, IIE Transactions, 39, 1, pp. 83-94, (2007); Alsnih R., Stopher P.R., Review of procedures associated with devising emergency evacuation plans, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1865, 1, pp. 89-97, (2004); Saeed Osman M., Ram B., Evacuation route scheduling using discrete time-based capacity-constrained model, Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM), 2011 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 161-165, (2011); Yersin B., Maim J., Morini F., Thalmann D., Real-time crowd motion planning, The Visual Computer, 24, 10, pp. 859-870, (2008); Radianti J., Granmo O.-C., Bouhmala N., Sarshar P., Yazidi A., Gonzalez J., Crowd models for emergency evacuation: A review targeting human-centered sensing, System Sciences (HICSS), 2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on, pp. 156-165, (2013); Wang P., Luh P.B., Chang S.-C., Marsh K.L., Efficient optimization of building emergency evacuation considering social bond of evacuees, Automation Science and Engineering 2009.

Short message service (SMS) which is an important component in mobile phones is growing popular among mobile phone subscribers. The use of SMS nowadays is more than the calling function itself. In order to make the SMS function in mobile phones more efficient and attractive, speech recognition which allows users to use it for voice messages and enables users to speak in a natural way to communicate with others through their mobile phones is introduced. However, speech recognition technology to SMS is in the form of standard language is contradicted with the popularity of SMS that is used in the form of text abbreviation or short form. The research was conducted to find a solution for speech recognition technologies to enable it to transfer human speech into personalized text abbreviations. Studies and findings had been conducted regarding the possible technologies to solve problems such as voice-tag, architecture of ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) system and Part-of-speech (POS). The problem with the inability to transfer speech to text abbreviation will be solved by adding a personalized data dictionary that enables users to save their own personalized words by integrating the voice-tag and part-of-speech tagging (POS) technology into iSay-SMS to help in saving and retrieving the text abbreviations. In addition, proposed framework of iSay-SMS is designed in such a way that promotes its marketability and increases the acceptance among the mobile phone subscribers. © 2010 IEEE.","Mobile devices; Short Messaging Services; speech recognition; text abbreviation","Cellular telephone systems; Character recognition; Message passing; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Research; Technology; Telephone; Telephone sets; Automatic speech recognition; Data dictionary; Hands-free; Human speech; Mobile phone subscribers; Part Of Speech; Part of speech tagging; Short message services; Short messaging service; Speech recognition technology; text abbreviation; Voice messages; Speech recognition","","","","","","","POS Tagging; Beasley R.E., Short message service (SMS) texting symbols: A functional analysis of 10, 000 cellular phone text messages, The Reading Matrix, 9, 2, pp. 89-99, (2009); Chen B., Part-of-speech Tagging, (2003); Cheng Y.M.C.M.A., Melnar L., Voice-to-phoneme conversion algorithms for speaker-Independent voice-tag applications in embedded platforms, Center for Human Interaction Research, pp. 403-408, (2005); Chou F.C., Patent application title: Method for setting voice tag, Patentdocs; Deller J., Hansen J., Proakis J., Discrete-time Processing of Speech Signals, (1999); Dermatas E., Kokkinakis G., Automatic stochastic tagging of natural language texts, Association for Computational Linguistics, 1995, 21, 2, pp. 137-163; Guevin J., Study: Texting while driving increases crash risk 23-fold, CNET News, (2009); Iso-Sipila J., Moberg M., Viikki O., Multi-lingual speaker-independent voice user interface for mobile devices, Nokia Technology Platforms, 1, pp. 1081-1084, (2006); Johansen A.S., Hansen J.P., Augmentative and alternative communication: The future of text on the move, Universal Access in the Information Society, 5, 2, pp. 125-149, (2006); Juang B.H., Rabiner L.R., Automatic Speech Recognition - A Brief History of the Technology Development, (2004); Kim H.K., Cox R.V., A bitstream-based front-end for wireless speech recognition on IS-136 communications system, IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing, 9, 5, pp. 558-568, (2001); Makayama, Voice Dial for IPhone - Advanced Speech Recognition for the iPhone, (2008); First Voice-to-SMS Application for iPhone Users in US, (2009); Novak M., Towards large vocabulary ASR on embedded platforms, INTERSPEECH 2004 - ICSLP 8th International Conference on Spoken Language Processing, (2004); Speech and Language Technology Part of Speech Tagging; Voice Dialing Definition (Phone Scoop), (2001); Robin, Parts-of-speech tagging, Natural Language Processing, (2009); Tan Z.H., Varga I., Network, distributed and embedded speech recognition: An overview, Automatic Speech Recognition on Mobile Devices and Over Communication Networks, pp. 1-23, (2008); Glossary of Telecommunication Terms-mobile Phone Directory, (2009); Varga I., Aalburg S., Andrassy B., Astrov S., Bauer J.G., Beaugeant Ch., Geissler Ch., Hoge H., ASR in mobile phones-an industrial approach, IEEE Transactionson Speech and Audio Processing, 10, 8, pp. 562-569, (2002); Weischedel R., Schwartz R., Palmucci J., Metter M., Ramshaw L., Coping with ambiguity and unknown words through probabilistic models, Association for Computational Linguistics, 19, 2, pp. 361-382, (1993); Curse of dimensionality, (2010); Teahan W.J., Cleary J.G., Tag based models of English text, Data Compression Conference, 1998.

However, the components have typically been studied individually, and most studies have found it difficult to investigate the effects of their combination on model performance. We are interested in examining the correlation between the number of trainable parameters in a deep learning model and its performance metrics under different hyperparameters. Specifically, we want to study the effects of using either the Adam or SGD optimizers at three varying learning rates. We use six pre-trained models whose trainable parameters have been quantitatively defined using two strategies: (1) freezing the convolutional basis with partially trainable weights and (2) training the whole model with most trainable weights to obtain a set of trainable parameters. Our experimental result shows a positive correlation between the trainable parameters and the test accuracy regardless of the level of the learning rate. However, for the generalization of the model, it was not guaranteed that a higher number of trainable parameters would lead to higher accuracy and F1 score. We have shown that the correlation between trainable parameters and model generalization becomes positive by using Adam with the smallest learning rate. © 2023 IEEE.","Deep Convolutional Neural Network; Fine-tuning; Parameters; Regularization","Computer vision; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Vehicle performance; Convolutional neural network; Deep convolutional neural network; Fine tuning; Hyper-parameter; Learning models; Learning rates; Modeling performance; Parameter; Performance; Regularisation; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","","","Alzubaidi L., Zhang J., Humaidi A.J., Al-Dujaili A., Duan Y., Al-Shamma O., Farhan L., Review of deep learning: Concepts, CNN architectures, challenges, applications, future directions, Journal of big Data, 8, 1, pp. 1-74, (2021); Yang L., Shami A., On hyperparameter optimization of machine learning algorithms: Theory and practice, Neurocomputing, 415, pp. 295-316, (2020); Schratz P., Muenchow J., Iturritxa E., Richter J., Brenning A., Hyperparameter tuning and performance assessment of statistical and machine-learning algorithms using spatial data, Ecological Modelling, 406, pp. 109-120, (2019); Tran T.T.K., Lee T., Kim J.S., Increasing neurons or deepening layers in forecasting maximum temperature time series?, Atmosphere, 11, 10, (2020); Jangid M., Srivastava S., Handwritten devanagari character recognition using layer-wise training of deep convolutional neural networks and adaptive gradient methods, Journal of Imaging, 4, 2, (2018); Chatelain A., Djeghri A., Hesslow D., Launay J., Is the Number of Trainable Parameters All That Actually Matters?

As open government data (OGD) and social networking services (SNSs) have grown rapidly, OD is considered as the most significant trend for users to enhance their decision-making process. The purpose of the study was to identify the proliferation of OD in ML approaches in generating decisions through a systematic literature review (SLR) and mapping the outcomes in trends. In this systematic mapping study (SMS), the articles published between 2011 and 2020 in major online scientific databases, including IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ACM, Science Direct and Ebscohost were identified and analyzed. A total of 576 articles were found but only 72 articles were included after several selection process according to SLR. The results were presented and mapped based on the designed research questions (RQs). In addition, awareness of the current trend in the OD setting can contribute to the real impact on the computing society by providing the latest development and the need for future research, especially for those dealing with the OD and ML revolution. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Machine learning; Open data; Prediction; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping study","Decision making; Machine learning; Mapping; Predictive analytics; Decision making process; Latest development; Research questions; Scientific database; Social networking services; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic mapping studies; Systematic Review; Open Data","","","","","","","Obama B., Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, (2009); Foulonneau M., Martin S., Turki S., How open data are turned into services?, International Conference on Exploring Services Science, pp. 31-39, (2014); Lindman J., Kinnari T., Rossi M., Industrial open data: Case studies of early open data entrepreneurs, 2014 47Th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, Pp. 739– 748.

Globalization has further encouraged FMS development into distributed, self-reliant units of production center. Flexible manufacturing system in distributed system (FMSDS) considers multi-factory environments, where jobs are processed by a system of FMSs. Scheduling problems in FMSDS deal with allocation of jobs to factories, independent assignment of job operation to machines, and operations sequencing on a machine. In addition, many previous studies neglect the impact of maintenance as one of the core parts of production scheduling. Maintenance significantly affects the overall performance of production scheduling. As such, maintenance is considered in this paper as part of production scheduling. This paper aims to minimize the global makespan over all the factories. This paper proposes an improved immune algorithm (IIA) to solve scheduling problems in FMSDS subjects to machine maintenance. Antibody encoding is adopted to explicitly represents information about a factory, job, and maintenance, while a greedy decoding procedure exploits scheduling flexibility and determines the job routings. Instead of the traditional mutation operator, an improvised mutation operator is used to improve the solutions by refining the most promising individuals within passing generation (iteration). The proposed approach was compared with an ant colony algorithm and several variants of genetic algorithms. The proposed IIA improved the global makespan from 4% to 33% compared with other algorithms. IIA performance has also been tested with several adjustments of population sizes, clonal selection rates, and local explorative mutation rates.","Artificial immune system; Distributed manufacturing; Flexible manufacturing system; Optimization; Preventive maintenance","","","","","","","","Bagheri A., Zandieh M., Mahdavi I., Yazdani M., An artificial immune algorithm for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem, Future Generation Computer Systems, 26, 4, pp. 533-541, (2010); Chan F.T.S., Chan H., Lau H., The state of the art in simulation study on fms scheduling: A comprehensive survey, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 19, 11, pp. 830-849, (2002); Chan F., Chung S., Chan P., An adaptive genetic algorithm with dominated genes for distributed scheduling problems, Expert Systems With Applications, 29, 2, pp. 364-371, (2005); Chan F., Chung S., Chan L., Finke G., Tiwari M., Solving distributed fms scheduling problems subject to maintenance: Genetic algorithms approach, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 22, 5, pp. 493-504, (2006); Shen W., Distributed manufacturing scheduling using intelligent agents, Intelligent Systems, IEEE, 17, 1, pp. 88-94, (2002); Jia H., Fuh J., Nee A., Zhang Y., Integration of genetic algorithm and gantt chart for job shop scheduling in distributed manufacturing systems, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 53, 2, pp. 313-320, (2007); Aboutalebi M., Shirgahi H., Motameni H., Distributed flexible manufacturing system (fms) scheduling using memetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and timed petri net, International Journal of the Physical Sciences, 6, 14, pp. 3557-3563, (2011); Jia H., Nee A., Fuh J., Zhang Y., A modified genetic algorithm for distributed scheduling problems, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 14, 3, pp. 351-362, (2003); de Giovanni L., Pezzella F., An improved genetic algorithm for the distributed and flexible job-shop scheduling problem, European Journal of Operational Research, 200, 2, pp. 395-408, (2010); Gholami M., Zandieh M., Integrating simulation and genetic algorithm to schedule a dynamic flexible job shop, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 20, 4, pp. 481-498, (2009); Lee D., Dicesare F., Scheduling flexible manufacturing systems using petri nets and heuristic search, Robotics and Automation, IEEE Transactions On, 10, 2, pp. 123-132, (1994); Paulli J., A hierarchical approach for the fms scheduling problem, European Journal of Operational Research, 86, 1, pp. 32-42, (1995); Reyes A., Yu H., Kelleher G., Lloyd S., Integrating petri nets and hybrid heuristic search for the scheduling of fms, Computers In Industry, 47, 1, pp. 123-138, (2002); Kumar R., Tiwari M., Shankar R., Scheduling of flexible manufacturing systems: An ant colony optimization approach, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, 217, 10, pp. 1443-1453, (2003); Jerald J., Asokan P., Prabaharan G., Saravanan R., Scheduling optimisation of flexible manufacturing systems using particle swarm optimisation algorithm, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 25, 9, pp. 964-971, (2005); Wadhwa S., Prakash A., Deshmukh S., A knowledge based ga approach for fms scheduling, Proceedings of the International MultiConference of Engineers and Computer Scientists, 2, (2009); Burnwal S., Deb S., Scheduling optimization of flexible manufacturing system using cuckoo search-based approach, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, pp. 1-9, (2012); Chan F., Chung S., Chan L., A study of distributed scheduling problem with machine maintenance, Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems, 2006 IEEE Conference On.

Two main colour transformation algorithms namely the Daltonize and RGB-HSV algorithm are compared to see the differences. The RGB-HSV algorithm was then selected to improve the colour contrast of the transformed images. The proposed algorithm from RGB colour space to HSV colour space focuses on the brightness of red and blue colours where red is modified to light red while green is modified to dark blue. The modified algorithm is named as RGB-HSV (B), whereby the ‘B’ is referring to brightness. RGB-HSV (B) is then tested on a group of 12colour deficient individuals via a designed questionnaire handed out to them. The process of modification involves 4 different values of colour range. The result from the surveyshows that colour deficient respondents are satisfied with RGB-HSV (B) with the colour value range of (Red*299) + (Green*587). ©, 2015 ICIC international.","Blue); Color transformation; Color vision deficiency; Green; HSV (Hue; LMS (Long; Medium; RGB (Red; Saturation; Short) wavelength; Value)","Algorithms; Color vision; Luminance; Saturation (materials composition); Blue); Color transformation; Color vision deficiencies; Green; HSV (Hue; LMS (Long; Medium; RGB (Red; Value); Color","","","","","","","Grantham J., Grantham E., Powers D., Website Accessibility: An Australian View, AUIC2012, (2012); Huang J.B., Tseng Y.C., Wu S.I., Wang S.J., Information preserving color transformation for protanopia and deuteranopia, Signal Processing Letters, pp. 711-714, (2007); Jefferson L., Harvey R., Accommodating color blind computer users, Proc.

However, as capacity planning is highly affected by the demand forecast uncertainty, there is a necessity to make the gap closer to ensure profitability. The paper defines the problems faced by a semiconductor company in handling capacity planning and balancing the capital investment cost against the risk of losing revenue. Machine allocation in capacity planning is a process to determine mixture of a machine types that satisfy all precedence and resource constraints and minimize the total machines allocation. We adopt constraint-based genetic algorithm (GA) to solve this optimization problem with the focus on mapping the right chromosome representation to the domain problem. The method is chosen to allow the running of GA in original form as well as to ensure the computation is straight forward and simple. © 2009 IEEE.","","Constrained optimization; Economics; Genetic algorithms; Profitability; Capacity planning; Capital investment; Constraint-based; Demand forecast; Domain problems; Handling capacity; Machine allocation; Machine requirements; Optimization problems; Resource Constraint; Semiconductor assembly; Semiconductor companies; Semiconductor manufacturing; Investments","","","","","","","Huang D., Yan J., Qiao F., Modeling with Hierarchical Petri Net of Semiconductor Manufacturing System, Proc. 8th IEEE Int.

There is no doubt that more and more Malaysians are using short message service (SMS) instead of making voice calls. In order to satisfy the needs and demands of users, mobile phone manufacturers are constantly adapting and innovating to ensure that they can survive in this competitive market. An important innovation in SMS technology lately is the speech recognition technology that can convert voice messages into text messages. In other words, messages can be voice/speech typed. Currently, voice messages can only be converted into text messages in the form of normal/standard text using fully spelled words. This paper attempts to evaluate the level of acceptance of a software application which uses either standard or abbreviation text messaging dictionary for voice messaging. The product is known as iSay-SMS, a hands-free voice messaging application that enables users to send messages without the need of using keypad to type messages in the form of original fully spelled word or abbreviations or shortened form of a word. Among various technology acceptance models studied, MOPTAM was chosen as the basis of the survey. The result of the survey concluded that iSay-SMS would be accepted by the majority of mobile phone users because of its ease of use. © 2010 IEEE.","Hands-free voice messaging; iSay-SMS; MOPTAM; Short Message Service (SMS); TAM; UTAUT","Cellular telephone systems; Character recognition; Innovation; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Speech recognition; Surveys; Technology; Telecommunication equipment; Telephone; Telephone sets; iSay-SMS; MOPTAM; Short message services; TAM; UTAUT; Voice messaging; Message passing","","","","","","","Kelsey R., Importance of Mobile Phones for Teenagers!, (2010); Kelsey R., Drive Safely with Mobile Phones!, (2010); Texting Increases Crash Risk 23 Times: Study, (2009); Fishbein M., Ajzen I., Belief, Attitude, Intention and Behaviour: An Introduction to Theory and Research, (1975); Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly, 13, 3, pp. 319-340; Kleijnen M., Wetzels M., De Ruyter K., Consumer acceptance of wireless finance, Journal of Financial Services Marketing, 8, 3, pp. 206-217, (2004); Malhotra Y., Galletta D.F., Extending the technology acceptance model to account for social influence: Theoretical bases and empirical validation, Proceedings of the Thirty-Second Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 1006-1020, (1999); Pang C., Ji X.F., An empirical study on predicting user purchase intention on the creative product: A case of apparel, International Symposium on Electronic Commerce and Security (ISECS), pp. 608-611, (2008); Venkatesh V., Morris M.G., Davis G.B., Davis F.D., User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view, MIS Quarterly, 27, 3, pp. 425-478, (2003); Van Biljon J., Kotze P., Modelling the factors that influence mobile phone adoption, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 226, pp. 152-161, (2007); Davis F.D., Bagozzi R.P., Warshaw P.R., User acceptance of computer technology: A comparison of two theoretical models, Management Science, 35, 8, pp. 982-1003, (1989); Kwon H.S., Chidambaram L., A test of the technology acceptance model: The case of cellular telephone adoption, Proceedings of the 33rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 1-10, (2000); Mallenius S., Rossi M., Tuunainen V.K., Factors Affecting the Adoption and use of Mobile Devices and Services by Elderly People - Results from A Pilot Study, (2007); Urbaczewski A., Wells J., Sarker S., Koivisto M., Exploring cultural differences as a means for understanding the global mobile internet: A theoretical basis and program of research, Proceedings of the 35th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, (2002); Renaud K., Biljon J.V., Predicting technology acceptance and adoption by the elderly: A qualitative study, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 210-219, (2008); Wong C.C., Enabling ecosystem for mobile advertising in an emerging economy, Monash University Doctoral Colloquium, (2009); Tseng A.H., Hsia J.W., The impact of internal locus of control on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use in elearning: An extension of the technology acceptance model, International Conference, (2008); Radner R., Rothschild M., On the allocation of effort, Journal of Economic Theory, 3, 10, pp. 358-376, (1975); Janelle R., Gerard F., Determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use in the technology acceptance model: Senior consumers' adoption of self-service banking technologies, Academy of World Business, Marketing & Management Development Conference Proceedings, (2006); Mario C., Fabio P., Massimo Z., Useful, Social and Enjoyable: Mobile Phone Adoption by Older People; Timothy T., Examining the Influence of Subjective Norm and Facilitating Conditions on the Intention to use Technology Among Pre-service Teachers: A Structural Equation Modeling of an Extended Technology Acceptance Model, (2009); Sap H.P., Adjusted R square, SAP Library - Glossary; Chapter 4 - Regression analysis SPSS, Department of Information and Computing Sciences of the Faculty of Science of Utrecht University, (2007); Durbin-watson statistic, Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia, (2010); DeFusco R.A., McLeavey D.W., Pinto J.E., Runkle D.E., Quantitative Investment Analysis, (2007); Creech S.D., ANOVA, (2010)","","","","IEEE Malaysia; IEEE Malaysia Power Electron.

Disaster is an unplanned situation that can happen anywhere and anytime. The worst case is when disasters happen on large gatherings which can increase risk of death during egress evacuation. When an emergency arises, crowds will evacuate to the nearest exit they know of. There are many risks involved during an emergency when it is unplanned. Research on crowd evacuation pay less attention to the realism of crowd behavioural factors which influence the evacuation result. As such this has prompted a novel crowd evacuation model as a potential solution for realistic crowd behavioural evacuation modelling through a combination of crowd behaviour, evacuation planning and path finding. © 2015 IEEE.","crowd behaviour evacuation modelling; Emergency evacuation; evacuation plan; path finding","Disasters; Software engineering; Crowd evacuation; Emergency evacuation; Emergency events; Evacuation modelling; Evacuation planning; Evacuation plans; Natural disasters; Path finding; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Chu M.L., Parigi P., Law K., Latombe I.-C., Safegress: A flexible platform to study the effect of human and social behaviors on egress performance, Proceedings of the Symposium on Simulation for Architecture & Urban Design, (2014); Aguirre B.E., Torres M.R., Gill K.B., Lawrence Hotchkiss H., Normative collective behavior in the station building fire∗, Social Science Quarterly, 92, 1, pp. 100-118, (2011); Sharma S., Simulation and modeling of group behavior during emergency evacuation, Intelligent Agents 2009.

Various introductory approaches were proposed to address the distributed production scheduling dilemma of FMS, where a significant part of the problem lies with preventive maintenance machine downtime. This affects overall production schedules, rendering previously proposed approaches ineffective. This paper introduces the Artificial Immune System (AIS) approach to tackle this underlying problem. Using the antigenic clustering features inherent in AIS, the problem will be replicated and tested with several parameter tweaks to demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating the issue. © 2013 ICIC International.","Artificial immune system; Distributed manufacturing; Flexible manufacturing system; Preventive maintenance","Immune system; Preventive maintenance; Production control; Production engineering; Artificial Immune System; Clustering feature; Distributed manufacturing; Distributed productions; Distributed scheduling problem; Machine downtime; Production schedule; Flexible manufacturing systems","","","","","","","Floyd T.L., Electronic Devices: Electron Flow Version, (2008); Kaewpoonsuk A., Petchmaneelumka W., Rerkratn A., Tammaruckwattana A., Riewruja V., A novel resolver-to-DC converter based on OTA-based inverse-sine function circuit, SICE Annual Conference, pp. 609-614, (2008); Chen D., Yang W., Pan M., Design of impedance measuring circuits based on phase-sensitive demodulation technique, IEEE Trans.

It belongs to the category of deep learning algorithms originating from Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) forms. In recent years, time series analysis and forecasting utilizing LSTM can be found in various domains, including finance, supply and demand forecasting, and health monitoring. This paper aims to analyze the previous recent studies from 2017 to 2021, emphasizing the LSTM approach to time series analysis and forecasting, highlighting the current enhancement methods in LSTM. It is found that the applications of LSTM in the current research related to time series involve forecasting or both. The finding also demonstrated the current application and advancement of LSTM using different enhancement techniques such as hyperparameter optimization, hybrid and ensemble. However, most researchers opt to hybridize LSTM with other algorithms. Further studying could be applied to improve LSTM performance, especially in the domain study, in which the LSTM enhancement technique has not been widely applied yet. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deep learning; Long short-term memory; Time series analysis; Time series forecasting","","","","","","","","Janiesch C., Zschech P., Heinrich K., Machine learning and deep learning, Electron.

Climate change has become a concern for the scientific community as it could affect human health. Researchers have found that climate change potentially impacts human mental health, especially among depressive patients. However, the relationship is still unclear and needs further investigation. The purpose of this systematic review is to systematically evaluate the evidence of the association between climate change effects on depressive patients, investigate the effects of environmental exposure related to climate change on mental health outcomes for depressive patients, analyze the current technique used to determine the relationship, and provide the guidance for future research. Articles were identified by searching specified keywords in six electronic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Springer, ScienceDirect, and IEEE Digital Library) from 2012 until 2021. Initially, 1823 articles were assessed based on inclusion criteria. After being analyzed, only 15 studies fit the eligibility criteria. The result from included studies showed that there appears to be strong evidence of the association of environmental exposure related to climate change in depressive patients. Temperature and air pollution are consistently associated with increased hospital admission of depressive patients; age and gender became the most frequently considered vulnerability factors. However, the current evidence is limited, and the output finding between each study is still varied and does not achieve a reasonable and mature conclusion regarding the relationship between the variables. Therefore, more evidence is needed in this domain study. Some variables might have complex patterns, and hard to identify the relationship. Thus, technique used to analyze the relationship should be strengthened to identify the relevant relationship.  © 2022 Nur Izzati Ab Kader et al.","","Air Pollution; Climate Change; Environmental Exposure; Forecasting; Humans; Temperature; adult; air pollution; climate change; eligibility criteria; environmental exposure; female; gender; hospital admission; human; library; male; Medline; mental health; outcome assessment; review; ScienceDirect; Scopus; search engine; systematic review; vulnerability; adverse event; air pollution; environmental exposure; forecasting; temperature","","","","","","","Field C.D., Dahe Q., Stocker T.F., Barros V., Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation, (2012); McGuigan K., Hoffmann A.A., Sgro C M., How is epigenetics predicted to contribute to climate change adaptation? what evidence do we need?, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 376, (2021); Lineman M., Do Y., Joo Ji.Y., Joo G.-J., Talking about climate change and global warming, PLoS One, 10, 9, (2015); Hayes K., Blashki G., Wiseman J., Reifels S., Reifelds L., Climate change and mental health: Risks, impacts and priority actions, International Journal of Mental Health Systems, 12, 1, (2018); Masson-Delmotte V., Zhai P., Ho P., Ipcc, 2018: Summary for Policymakers.

Since an imbalance data may generate suboptimal classification models, it could lead to the minority examples are misclassified frequently and hardly achieving the best performance. This study proposes an improved support vector machine (SVM) method for imbalanced data namely as SVM-GA by optimizing SVM algorithm with Genetic Algorithm (GA) over a synthetic minority oversampling technique. Besides considering the best sampling method in optimized SVM, the experimental result shows that the proposed method improves by 97% compared to the baseline model and selected optimized models. The proposed model had significant performance by outperformed the baseline model and other models based SVM with Grid search and Randomized search in most of the cases, especially for the datasets which have extremely rare cases. © 2023, Penerbit UTM Press.

Various approaches have addressed the assembly line balancing (ALB) problem for decades. Although solving the ALB problem is crucial, a bottleneck may still occur over the next operation stages. As such, two research directions are necessary. On top of proposing an efficient search mechanism, optimum information utilization is also needed where the expected outcome would benefit both ways. Also, the utilization of problem-specific information (bottleneck identification) is expected to improve the ALB problem's solution quality. This paper provides a proof-of-concept for such claims by proposing two artificial immune systems (AIS) approaches, namely as the contagious immune network (COMET) approach, catered for the ALB problem where problem-specific information was incorporated. The proposed AIS approaches were tested on 24 ALB benchmark data sets to determine its effectiveness and highlight the impact of incorporating bottleneck identification. Also, a comparative analysis of the proposed approaches against the approaches from the literature was statistically justified. © 2020 IEEE.","","Assembly; Automatic identification; Immune system; Artificial Immune System;

Nevertheless, this manual process is highly subjective, prone to error and human bias, time-consuming, and can result in multiple pregnancies. Since the grading system for blastocyst embryos remains inconsistent, the successful rate of IVF remains low for achieving a healthy pregnancy. This study proposes an automated system for grading the quality of blastocyst embryos to enhance IVF selection methods using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and VGG-16 with new classification layers. The CNN model has achieved training and validation accuracy of 97% and 95%, respectively, while in the testing stage with accuracy of 90% of average precision, recall, and F1-score of 91.3%, 90%, and 90%, respectively. Additionally, VGG16 with the new classification layers achieved impressive training and validation accuracy of 99.4% and 99.5% respectively, with outstanding testing accuracy of 94% and average precision, recall, and F1-score of 94.5%, 94%, and 94%, respectively. The proposed automated system is helpful for embryologists in providing consistent blastocyst grading and selection methods in IVF process. © 2023 IEEE.","Augmentation; blastocyst; CNN; IVF; VGG-16","Automation;

Currently, OD is commonly regarded as the most crucial trend for users to improve their ability to make decisions, particularly to the exponential expansion of social networking sites (SNSs) and open government data (OGD). The purpose of this study was to examine if there was an increase in the usage of OD in ML prediction techniques by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) of the results of the trends. The papers published in major online scientific databases between 2011 and 2020, including ScienceDirect, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM, and Springer, were identified and analysed. After various selection processes, according to SLR based on precise inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 302 articles were located. However, only 81 of them were included. The findings were presented and plotted based on the research questions (RQs). In conclusion, this research could be beneficial to organisations, practitioners, and researchers by providing information on current trends in the implementation of ML prediction using OD setting by mapping studies based on the RQs designed, the most recent growth, and the necessity for future research based on the findings. © 2022.

This includes cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of academic courses taken, co-curriculum involvement, soft skills, hard work, leadership, attitude, time management, attendance, attire, and technical skill in order to make the selection decision. The distinctive student is identified firstly based on their overall score. The problem arises when one needs to evaluate all these different criteria in order to select or nominated a model student. It is a tedious task and time consuming for examiner or reviewer to analyze students individually in order to select a student that showed desirable performance. In addition, as a human has its limitation, there is a high degree of error in judgment in decision making. With the aim of bridging this gap, fuzzy logic is applied to imitate human analytic thinking or the ability to make a decision in the model student selection process. Thus, the system is able to assist examiner or evaluator in the decision-making process of determining the model student with minimal time and error. Furthermore, the user could dynamically change the criteria based on the traits that have been set by the system. Fuzzy logic is chosen as it is a powerful mathematical tool involving ambiguous and incomplete information supported by the experience and judgment of examiner or reviewer while combining this cognitive ability in order to reach a verdict. Therefore, the outputs from the experiment conducted shows that the system provides robust output and information to the user regarding student's aptitude and ultimately aim to effectively predict human judgment. © 2016 IEEE.","","Computer circuits; Decision making; Education; Fuzzy logic; Cumulative grade point averages; Decision making process; Educational institutions; Fuzzy logic reasoning; Incomplete information; Mathematical tools; Selection decisions; Student selections; Students","","","","","","","Petrudi S.H.J., Pirouz M., Pirouz B., Application of fuzzy logic for performance evaluation of academic students, 2013 13th Iranian Conference on Fuzzy Systems (IFSC), (2013); Kharola A., Kunwar S., Choudhury G.B., Students performance evaluation: A fuzzy logic reasoning approach, PM World Journal, 4, pp. 1-11, (2015); Gokmen G., Akinci T.C.C., Tektas M., Onat N., Kocyigit G., Tektas N., Evaluation of student performance in laboratory applications using fuzzy logic, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2, 2, pp. 902-909, (2010); Deliktas D., Ustun O., Student selection and assignment methodology based on fuzzy multimoora and multichoice goal programming, International Transactions in Operational Research, (2015); Gardner A.K., Ritter E.M., Paige J.T., Ahmed R.A., Fernandez G., Dunkin B.J., Simulation-based selection of surgical trainees: Considerations, challenges, and opportunities, Journal of the American College of Surgeons, (2016); Razack S., Hodges B., Steinert Y., Maguire M., Seeking inclusion in an exclusive process: Discourses of medical school student selection, Medical Education, 49, 1, pp. 36-47, (2015); Schaeperkoetter C.C., Bass J.R., Gordon B.S., Student-athlete school selection: A family systems theory approach, Journal of Intercollegiate Sport, 8, 2, (2015); Tavana M., Azizi F., Azizi F., Behzadian M., A fuzzy inference system with application to player selection and team formation in multiplayer sports, Sport Management Review, 16, 1, pp. 97-110, (2013); Tseng T.-L.B., Huang C.-C., Chu H.-W., Gung R.R., Novel approach to multi-functional project team formation, International Journal of Project Management, 22, 2, pp. 147-159, (2004); Strnad D., Guid N., A fuzzy-genetic decision support system for project team formation, Applied Soft Computing, 10, 4, pp. 1178-1187, (2010); Mamdani E.H., Assilian S., An experiment in linguistic synthesis with a fuzzy logic controller, International Journal of Man-machine Studies, 7, 1, pp. 1-13, (1975); Takagi T., Sugeno M., Fuzzy identification of systems and its applications to modeling and control, Systems, Man and Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on, 1, pp. 116-132, (1985); Kaehler S., Fuzzy logic tutorial.

However they probably encounter hajj related problems that require them to make immediate decisions especially while performing hajj. In such situations they may refer to hajj guide books or their fellow pilgrims. Besides, they may need to refer to hajj experts in the decision making process pertaining to more complex problems. Nevertheless, experts may not be around all the time especially while performing hajj rituals. We propose a knowledge-based approach that can capture possible problems and solutions from the experts in a prototype known as hajj Q&A expert system or Hajj-QAES. It provides an interface that enables experts to capture both simple and advanced questions. Thus, we anticipate Hajj-QAES can support pilgrims both in learning process and most importantly while performing hajj in Mecca. Such systems would be more accessible should it be installed in handheld devices such as a hand phone or a personal digital assistant (PDA). © 2009 IEEE.","Decision making; Expert system; Hajj complex problems; Knowledge base","Digital devices; Expert systems; Personal digital assistants; Telephone systems; Complex problems; Decision making process; Hand held device; Knowledge base; Knowledge-based approach; Knowledge-based expert systems; Learning process; Decision making","","","","","","","Hsu Y.-Y., Su C.-C., A rule-based expert system for steady-state stability analysis [of Power Systems], IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 6, 2, pp. 771-777, (1991); Santos C.P., Querying petrographic descriptions in an intelligent database system, IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Systems (ICAIS 2002), pp. 18-23, (2002); Kienreich W., Sabol V., Granitzer M., Klieber W., Lux M., Sarka W., A Visual query interface for a very large newspaper article repository, Proceedings of Sixteenth International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications, pp. 415-419, (2005); Lovic S., Meiliu L., Du Z., Enhancing search engine performance using expert systems, IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration, pp. 567-572, (2006); Shao W.Z., Soon H.S., Intelligent query mechanism for expert systems, Proceedings of Fourteenth Annual International Computer Software and Expert System Applications Conference COMPSAC90, pp. 599-604, (1990); Lopatenko A., Bertossi L., Consistent query answering by minimal-size repairs, 17th International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications DEXA'06, pp. 558-562, (2006); Giarratano J., Riley G., Expert Systems Principles and Programming, (1998); Knauf R., Tsuruta S., Gonzalez A.J., Toward reducing human involvement in validation of knowledge-based system, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernatics, 37, 1 PART A, pp. 120-131, (2007); Bratko I., Prolog Programming for Artificial Intelligence, (2001); Hajj Al-Islam.com; Soleh Al-Munajid M., Abdullah B.

Many factors contribute towards a person getting a positive diagnosis such as hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol level, among others. It proves to be a challenge to accurately predict the presence of a cardiovascular disease as this is a complex task. Timely and correct diagnosis is considered a highly important area in the field of clinical research and healthcare. Vast troves of data are collected by the healthcare industry every year and using this data effectively can prove to be an invaluable asset to the field. Machine learning and ensemble classification models can be employed to accurately predict heart disease in patients. Data mining techniques presented in this paper make use of patient data, from the UCI machine learning repository, to build a classification model that can be applied to new cases for the detection of heart disease.

The human emotional transition between normal to panic state is due to extreme event which is beyond control. In the past, crowd behavior models for emergency evacuation being studied are aircraft emergency evacuation, emotional ant based, behavior based real time evacuation and many more which is related to the behavior and life like. They are different types of approached used to model crowd to be the same as the real world such as mathematical and heuristic approaches. Mathematical approach is accurate however in modelling human behaviour which is complex in terms of behavior (emotions), cognitive and appraisal, heuristic approach is preferred. In defining human behavior (emotions) in a real world, fuzzy logic approach is chosen to be incorporated into an intelligent agent based on emotions and stress theory. Within this paper we intend to outline our proposed model with extracting data from the real world video into fuzzy rules in producing real life crowd evacuation modelling. © 2016 IEEE.","","Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Heuristic methods; Human computer interaction; Social sciences; Aircraft emergency evacuations; Crowd evacuation; Emergency evacuation; Fuzzy logic approach; Heuristic approach; Human behaviours; Mathematical approach; Real world videos; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Connor D.J.O., Integrating human behavior factors into design an examination of behaviors that increase or reduce harm from fires, Fire Protection Engineering, 28, (2005); Shields T., Proulx G., The science of human behaviour: Past research endeavours, current developments and fashioning a research agenda, Fire Safety Science, 6, pp. 95-113, (2000); Proulx G., Richardson J., The human factor: Building designers often forget how important the reactions of the human occupants are when they specify fire and life safety systems, Canadian Consulting Engineer, 43, 3, pp. 35-36, (2002); Galea E., Pedestrian and evacuation dynamics, Proceedings of 2nd International Conference on Pedestrian and Evacuation Dynamics, (2003); Santos G., Aguirre B.E., A Critical Review of Emergency Evacuation Simulation Models, (2004); Wang C., Li C., Liu Y., Cui J., Zhang T., Behavior-based simulation of real-time crowd evacuation, Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics (CAD/Graphics), 2011 12th International Conference On.

Planning a suitable evacuation route and identifying the shortest evacuation route before the occurrence of extreme events are crucial for risk mitigation. Probable crowd dynamics, especially group-based characteristics (e.g., group formation, group relation, and group competition), may occur, often rendering evacuation plan unfeasible. Previously, several emergency route planning (ERP) approaches have been proposed which can be categorized as mathematical, heuristic, and meta-heuristic. Reduction in the computational complexity and optimum solution generation of the meta-heuristic approach has inspired the adoption of an immune-based approach, namely an integrated evacuation planning with dynamism (iEvaP+) approach, to cater crowd grouping while optimizing the route selection. Two case studies have been considered to evaluate the iEvaP+ approach effectiveness, where four out of six test cases had obtained statistically different results (p-value ≤ 0.026067) against the approach proposed by Jiang et al. © 2015 ICIC International.","Crowd grouping; Dynamic models; Emergency evacuation; Emergency route planning; Immune-based algorithms","Dynamic models; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Crowd grouping; Emergency evacuation; Emergency response; Emergency route; Evacuation planning; Group competitions; Immune-based approach; Meta-heuristic approach; Optimization","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","","Jiang T., Ren G., Zhao X., Evacuation route optimization based on tabu search algorithm and hill-climbing algorithm, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 96, pp. 865-872, (2013); Radianti J., Granmo O.-C., Sarshar P., Goodwin M., Dugdale J., Gonzalez J.J., A spatiotemporal probabilistic model of hazard- and crowd dynamics for evacuation planning in disasters, Applied Intelligence, 42, 1, pp. 3-23, (2015); Hsu Y.-T., Peeta S., An aggregate approach to model evacuee behavior for no-notice evacuation operations, Transportation, pp. 1-26, (2013); Qiu F., Hu X., Modeling group structures in pedestrian crowd simulation, Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 18, 2, pp. 190-205, (2010); Zeng M., Wang C., Evacuation route planning algorithm: Longer route preferential, Advances in Neural Networks, Springer, pp. 1062-1071, (2009); Lv Y., Huang G., Sun W., Chao D., A scenario-based modeling approach for emergency evacuation management and risk analysis under multiple uncertainties, Journal of Hazardous Materials, (2012); Campos V., Bandeira R., Bandeira A., A method for evacuation route planning in disaster situations, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 54, pp. 503-512, (2012); Massink M., Latella D., Bracciali A., Harrison M.D., Hillston J., Scalable context-dependent analysis of emergency egress models, Formal Aspects of Computing, 24, 2, pp. 267-302, (2012); Zhang F., Liu M., Zhou Z., Shen W.-M., Quantum ant colony algorithm-based emergency evacuation path choice algorithm, IEEE the 17Th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design, pp. 576-580, (2013); Chiu Y.-C., Zheng H., Villalobos J., Gautam B., Modeling no-notice mass evacuation using a dynamic traffic flow optimization model, IIE Transactions, 39, 1, pp. 83-94, (2007); De Francca F.O., Von Zuben F.J., A dynamic artificial immune algorithm applied to challenging benchmarking problems, IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, pp. 423-430, (2009); Lau H.Y., Wong V.W., An immunity approach to strategic behavioral control, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 20, 3, pp. 289-306, (2007); De Castro L.N., Timmis J., Artificial immune systems as a novel soft computing paradigm, Soft Computing, 7, 8, pp. 526-544, (2003); McEwan C., Hart E., Clonal selection from first principles, Artificial Immune Systems, Springer, pp. 18-32, (2010); Freschi F., Repetto M., Multiobjective optimization by a modified artificial immune system algorithm, Artificial Immune Systems, Springer, pp. 248-261, (2005); Bagheri A., Zandieh M., Mahdavi I., Yazdani M., An artificial immune algorithm for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem, Future Generation Computer Systems, 26, 4, pp. 533-541, (2010); Moreland R.L., Levine J., Wingert M., Creating the ideal group: Composition effects at work, Understanding Group Behavior, 2, pp. 11-35, (2013); Liu S., Yang L., Fang T., Li J., Evacuation from a classroom considering the occupant density around exits, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 388, 9, pp. 1921-1928, (2009); Ibrahim M., Abdul-Hamid K., Ibrahim M., Mohd-Din A., Yunus R., Yahya M., The development of fire risk assessment method for heritage building, Procedia Engineering, 20, pp. 317-324, (2011)","","","ICIC Express Letters Office","","","","","","1881803X","","","","English","ICIC Express Lett.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947283817"

STEM students in schools and in higher educational institutions appear to be waning, as evidenced by low secondary school STEM enrolments. To add to this, there are also STEM stream students who dropped out and switched to non-STEM streams. This resulted in a shortage of qualified candidates for STEM-based higher education programmes, and subsequently an insufficient number of STEM graduates. Researchers have found several potential contributing factors that may have impacted students’ selection of STEM. However, this relationship is still unclear and needs further investigation. This goal of this systematic review is to assess the factors that can be used to predict students’ selection of a STEM major using existing techniques. To do this, PRISMA's Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process was used to map the findings of previous studies based on the designed research questions (RQs). More specifically, the objective of this analysis was to compile, summarise, and assess related works in order to identify current contributing variables, potential techniques, dataset characteristics, challenges, and future directions within the scope of this investigation. Papers published in major online scientific databases, including Science Direct, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM, ProQuest, and Springer, between 2011 and April 2021 were identified and analyzed. Although there were 1248 publications found through extensive SLR selection processes using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 121 articles were selected. After being analyzed, only 16 articles were found to have discussed about machine learning (ML) techniques and showed that the most accurate predictions were possible based on different variables or factors. In addition, the dataset characteristics were found to have impacted the accuracy of the prediction results. However, the available evidences were limited, and the output findings from each study reviewed were relatively diverse. Therefore, evidences discussing the potential usefulness of ML techniques to analyse the relationship between contributing factors should be strengthened. © 2023 The Authors","Machine learning prediction; STEM stream; Systematic literature review","","","","","","Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, (J48); Naive Bayes; Random Forest; Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM; Universiti Malaysia Perlis","Environmental Factors: Environmental factors category looks at how support from friends and families, academic environments, including mentoring relationships, and residential environments would have a more positive outcome and expectations in the STEM field, and they serve as a protective factor in academically challenging environments, as well as an important socialising agent in determining the field of study choice. The variable of parental encouragement was discovered to be a critical developmental predictor that laid the groundwork for a STEM career (Wang and Zhao, 2012; Wang, Ye and Degol, 2017). The breadth of teacher influence variables include anything from assisting students in improving their academic success and self-assurance to maximising student exposure to mathematics and science courses, which was a significant predictor of STEM growth (Heaverlo, 2011; Sellami, El-Kassem, Al-Qassass and Al-Rakeb, 2017; Wang and Kenny, 2011). Teachers can take various steps in the classroom to improve student engagement and confidence (Rabenberg, 2013). Student's STEM career aspiration variable has a remarkable influence on the environmental factor category in students’ STEM prediction (Radzi and Sulaiman, 2018). Researches had shown that students who have a clear and defined career goal in a STEM field were more likely to persist in their studies and eventually enter into a STEM profession. One of the main factors contributing to their career aspiration in STEM was the recruitment opportunities after degree. Some literatures also considered financial aid such as scholarship and merit-based aid program affected students’ college decisions in STEM fields major (Sjoquist and Winters, 2015; Sinatra, Brem, & Evans, 2008). Financial aid made available to students in urban areas (Ansong, Okumu, Albritton, Bahnuk, & Small, 2020), may make STEM education more accessible than it is in rural regions. Financial hurdles were cited as a reason why high school students chose not to pursue STEM areas in college. Indeed, Wang and Kenny (2011) found a link between financial aid and being driven to do well in mathematics and pursuing STEM careers in college.The findings of this research highlighted the enormous potential of the ML-based prediction method, the newest development in STEM stream predictions, as well as the need for more research in the future. Although only a few articles reported about the use of ML, it is showing an upward trend in recent publications. There is also the fact that ML is open to potential improvement that has yet to be considered. There is evidence that ML techniques have become increasingly popular for prediction and many decisions have been made as a result of the effective and efficient use of data mining. As an example, in an educational dataset, ML techniques can be used to uncover hidden patterns and create a prediction system that can forecast a group of secondary school subjects (e.g. Science, Business Studies, and Humanities) (Hasan et al., 2020). The classification technique in supervised ML was found to be more popular in the review, with 11 articles, compared to Deep Learning-based approaches, which had only two. According to the literatures, the classification method, predicts a discrete output value that can be implemented utilising a number of different algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), including Naive Bayes (NB), Logical Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Decision Tree (DT), J48, and Bayesian Model algorithm. However, none of the papers mentioned that a regression approach such as Linear Regression or Decision Trees Regressor, which predicts a continuous value output, may be used. Despite the fact that unsupervised learning techniques were rarely discussed in the literature, it is interesting to note that numerous clustering algorithms, such as Fuzzy and K-means, have been applied (2 articles). This strategy is advantageous when the data set has no labels applied to it. It looks for tendencies that have not been seen before but with the least amount of human examination.The authors would like to express their gratitude to Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) and Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP) for their support in completing this study.","Abd Elrahman S.M., Abraham A., A review of class imbalance problem, Journal of Network and Innovative Computing, 1, pp. 332-340, (2013); Ade R., Deshmukh P., An incremental ensemble of classifiers as a technique for prediction of student's career choice, 2014 first in- ternational conference on networks & soft computing (ICNSC2014), pp. 384-387, (2014); Agirdag O., The impact of school ses composition on science achievement and achievement growth: Mediating role of teachers' teachability culture, Educational Research and Evaluation, 24, pp. 264-276, (2018); Ahmad T.B.T., Nordin M.S., Ibrahim M.B., Drivers of secondary school students' intention to enrol in science studies, Universal Journal of Educational Research, 7, pp. 42-47, (2019); Ahmed W., Developmental trajectories of math anxiety during ado- lescence: Associations with stem career choice, Journal of Adolescence, 67, pp. 158-166, (2018); Ahmed S.A., Khan S.I., A machine learning approach to predict the engineering students at risk of dropout and factors behind: Bangladesh perspective, 2019 10th international conference on computing, communication and networking technologies (ICCCNT), pp. 1-6, (2019); Ainley M., Ainley J., Student engagement with science in early ado- lescence: The contribution of enjoyment to students' continuing interest in learning about science, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 36, pp. 4-12, (2011); Ainslie P.J., Huffman S.L., Human resource development and expanding stem career learning opportunities: Exploration, internships, and externships, Advances in Developing Human Resources, 21, pp. 35-48, (2019); Alhaddab T., Alnatheer S., Future scientists: How women's and minorities' math self-efficacy and science perception affect their stem major selection, IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, pp. 58-63, (2015); Ali U., Arif K.S., Qamar U., A hybrid scheme for feature selection of high dimensional educational data, 2019 international conference on communication technologies (ComTech), pp. 71-75, (2019); Alkhasawneh R., Hargraves R.H., Developing a hybrid model to predict student first year retention in stem disciplines using machine learning techniques, Journal of STEM Education: Innovations and Research, 15, (2014); Alyahyan E., Dustegor D., Predicting academic success in higher education: Literature review and best practices, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 17, (2020); Anderhag P., Emanuelsson P., Wickman P.O., Hamza K.M., Students' choice of post-compulsory science: In search of schools that compensate for the socio-economic background of their students, International Journal of Science Education, 35, pp. 3141-3160, (2013); Ansong D., Okumu M., Albritton T.J., Bahnuk E.P., Small E., The role of social support and psychological well-being in stem perfor- mance trends across gender and locality: Evidence from Ghana, Child Indicators Research, 13, pp. 1655-1673, (2020); Archer L., DeWitt J., Osborne J., Dillon J., Willis B., Wong B., “doing” science versus “being” a scientist: Examining 10/11-year-old schoolchildren's constructions of science through the lens of identity, Science Education, 94, pp. 617-639, (2010); Archer L., DeWitt J., Osborne J., Dillon J., Willis B., Wong B., ‘not girly, not sexy, not glamorous’: Primary school girls' and parents' constructions of science aspirations, Pedagogy, Culture & Society, 21, pp. 171-194, (2013); Archer L., DeWitt J., Willis B., Adolescent boys' science aspirations: Masculinity, capital, and power, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 51, pp. 1-30, (2014); Arop F.O., Okon J., School management practices, teachers effectiveness, and students' academic performance in mathematics in secondary schools of cross river state, Nigeria, Humanities and Social Sciences Letters, 8, 3, pp. 298-309, (2020); Asadullah M.N., Trannoy A., Tubeuf S., Yalonetzky G., Measuring educational inequality of opportunity: pupil's effort matters, World Development, 138, (2021); Association N.S.T., Et al., Nsta position statement: Elementary science education, (2018); Astorne-Figari C., Speer J.D., Are changes of major major changes?

It is becoming more challenging with an issues of highly imbalanced class. In the field of data mining, prediction or typically known as data classification problem involved detecting events. Uncommon events are hard to identify on account of their inconsistency and casualness, however, misclassifying rare events can result in heavy costs. Thus, to overcome this issues, it is suggested by few researches to overcome at the stage of pre-processing itself. One of the pre-processing methods available is sampling methods. In sampling methods, oversampling and undersampling is the most widely used techniques in imbalanced data. This paper try to investigate the performance of classification model when combining the method of oversamplings and undersampling in detecting the fraud cases from the fraud detection dataset. Few oversampling techniques is selected to combine with random undersampling techniques to undergo the process and the performance of the model is evaluate using random forest classifier and performance measure selected that is suitable for imbalanced class problem. The results obtained then compared with previous literature. From the results, the combination of oversampling and undersampling techniques gives a better precision, recall and F1-Measure value in average of 0.80%. © 2020 IEEE.","","Crime; Data mining; Decision trees; Processing; Classification models; Data classification problems; Fraudulent transactions; Imbalanced classification; Oversampling technique; Pre-processing method; Random forest classifier; Random under samplings; Classification (of information)","","","","","Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, JAIST, (:308/PKOMP/41560112); Universiti Sains Malaysia","Funding text 1: The authors wish to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), in collaboration with Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), through SanDisk Storage Malaysia Sdn.

The assembly line operations are balanced among the available resources to obtain an equal amount of workload to achieve optimum resource utilization, called the assembly line balancing (ALB) problem. Various approaches have been proposed to solve the ALB problem, which is broadly categorized as exact, heuristic, and meta-heuristic approaches. Although solving the ALB problem is crucial, a bottleneck may still occur over the next operation stages. By using problem-specific information (bottleneck identification), it is expected to improve the solution quality of the ALB problem. As such, the contribution of this study is the computational method, namely as the swarm of immune cells with bottleneck identification (SIC+) approach, where both the ALB and bottleneck identification problems are addressed. In addition to the flexible problem representation, the SIC+ approach is equipped with a discrete bottleneck simulator to simulate the bottleneck scenario and bottleneck-specific operators to redistribute the machine workload of the identified bottleneck machine. The approach was tested on 24 benchmark data sets of the ALB problem, and the impact of incorporating bottleneck identification was illustrated. The experimental results show that the proposed SIC+ approach has achieved a total of 66.12% optimal solution over all instances of the benchmark data sets and has been compared with approaches from the literature where high-quality solutions were statistically justified. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial immune system; Assembly line balancing problem; Manufacturing assembly operation; Shifting bottleneck; Type E objective","Assembly; Assembly machines; Balancing; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Artificial Immune System; Assembly line balancing; Assembly line balancing problems; Bottleneck identifications; High-quality solutions; Manufacturing industries; Meta-heuristic approach; Problem representation; Benchmarking","","","","","Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, JAIST, (1001/PKOMP/8014084); Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors wish to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), in collaboration with Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), for the support it has extended in the completion of the present research through the Research University Grant (RUI) (1001/PKOMP/8014084).

Based on evaluation criteria, FS can be either filter or wrapper. Wrappers are computationally expensive due to many feature interactions in the search space. In this study, cuckoo optimisation algorithm (COA) along with its binary (BCOA) are used as wrapper-based FS for the first time to explore the promising regions in the search space, which obtained improved classification accuracy and selected better quality subsets of features within a shorter time. Based on that we developed two different fitness functions. The first one (BCOA-FS) and (BCOA-FS) adopt the standard wrapper-based evaluation with emphasis mainly on the classification performance. Whereas in the second one (BCOA-2S) and (COA2S) combine the first one in another evaluation process with a focus on both the number of features and classification accuracy. The results obtained indicate that COA-FS and BCOA-FS can select fewer features with better accuracy on both categorical and continuous label data, with BCOA-FS better than COA-FS. Similarly, COA-2S performed better than BCOA-FS and COA-2S and is comparable to the existing works. BCOA-2S outperformed the three of the existing studies on the majority of the datasets with almost 10 and 5% on both classification accuracy and number of selected features, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Binary Cuckoo optimisation algorithm and Classification; Cuckoo optimisation algorithm; Feature selection; Wrapper-based","","","","","","","","Aha D.W., Bankert R.L., A comparative evaluation of sequential feature selection algorithms, Learning from Data, pp. 199-206, (1996); Ahmad S., Et al., Feature selection using salp swarm algorithm with chaos, ICFNDS '18 Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Metaheuristics & Swarm Intelligence, pp. 65-69, (2018); Alickovic E., Subasi A., Breast cancer diagnosis using GA feature selection and Rotation Forest, Neural Comput.

Learning style of specific users in an online learning system is determined based on their interaction and behavior towards the system. The most common online learning theory used in determining the learning style is the Felder-Silverman’s Learning Style Model (FSLSM). Many researchers have proposed machine learning algorithms to establish learning style by using the log file attributes. This helps in determining the learning style automatically. However, current researches still perform poorly, where the range of accuracy is between 58%-89%. Hence, RF(Xgb) is proposed to help in improving the learning style prediction. This hybrid algorithm was further enhanced by optimizing its parameters. From the experiments, RF(Xgb) was proven to be more effective, with accuracy of 96% compared to J48 and LSID-ANN algorithm from previous literature. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The recent trend in globalization has led to an egression of distributed, unique, and independent units of production centers. The FMS in a distributed system (FMSDS) is considered as a multi-factory environment, where jobs are processed by FMSs. Problems in FMSDS are related to the allocation of jobs to factories, independent assignment of job operation of machines, and operations sequencing on the machine. In addition, impact of the maintenance as one of the core parts of production scheduling has been previously neglected, thereby affecting the overall performance of the production schedule. Hence, this work considers maintenance as part of production scheduling. The objective of this study is to minimize the global makespan throughout the multi-factory network. This paper proposes a modified chemical reaction optimization algorithm to solve the problems in FMSDS. The molecule encoding explicitly represents the information on the factory, job, and maintenance; whereas a greedy decoding procedure exploits flexibility and determines job routing. An improvised crossover operator is used to improve the solutions by refining the most promising individuals of each generation. The proposed approach is compared with other algorithms, and algorithm performance is tested with several parameter refinements. Satisfactory results were achieved where about 1% to 26% deviations are observed when compared to other algorithms. The contribution of the study and the potential future works has also been discussed. © 2015 ICIC International.","Chemical reaction optimization; Distributed system; Flexible manufacturing system; Machine maintenance;

Most of the existing models are biased toward the majority class neglecting the minority class. The proposed Bayesian optimization cost-sensitive XGboost model is configured to be applied to the semiconductor dataset. The obtained experimental results-based on benchmarking semiconductor industry dataset-show 91.46% and 23.08% for the pass and fail accuracies, respectively. This confirms that the proposed model is significant for imbalanced cases in semiconductor applications. Moreover, this investigation reveals that the proposed model is able not only to maintain the performance of the majority class, but also to classify well the minority class. © 2023, Tafila Technical University.

The techniques used by previous researchers for forecasting, primarily based on statistical approaches, which often require extensive data preprocessing and expert knowledge, can be time-consuming and difficult. Therefore, this study analyses three current deep learning (DL) algorithms, recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), for forecasting inpatient and outpatient visits for depressive disorders. These algorithms are among the most familiar DL techniques for time series and have been used with remarkable success in various contexts. The DL algorithms were evaluated using mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Based on the results comparison, LSTM has the best performance (lowest error values) compared to the RNN and GRU. The DL algorithms are also being compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, and the results show that the DL algorithms can accurately forecast inpatient and outpatient visits compared to the previously proposed algorithms. The findings from this study could be helpful in clinical decision-making and resource allocation in mental health care. © 2023 The Authors.","Deep learning; Depression; Psychiatric Department; Time series forecasting","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/USM/02/3)","The authors would like to extend their gratitude to the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia for providing funds for this research.

The situation poses a need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of capacity planning and resource optimization while still maintaining their flexibilities. Machine loading - one of the important components of capacity planning is known for its complexity that encompasses various types of flexibilities pertaining to part selection, machine and operation assignment along with constraints. The main objective of the flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is to balance the productivity of the production floor as well as maintaining its flexibility. From the literature, optimization-based methods tend to become impractical when the problem size increases while heuristic-based methods are more robust in their practicality although they may dependent on constraints of individual problems. We adopt a Harmony Search algorithm (HS) to solve this problem that aims on mapping the feasible solution vectors to the domain problem. The objectives are to minimize the system unbalance as well as increase throughput while satisfying the technological constraints such as machine time availability and tool slots. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on 10 sample problems available in FMS literature and compared with existing solution methods. © 2011 IEEE.","Flexible manufacturing system; Harmony Search algorithm; Machine loading; System unbalance; Throughput","Competition; Data mining; Heuristic methods; Learning algorithms; Life cycle; Loading; Machine components; Optimization; Problem solving; Search engines; Capacity planning; Domain problems; Feasible solution; Harmony search algorithms; Machine loading; Machine loading problems; Machine time; Manufacturing industries; Part selection; Problem size; Product life cycles; Product variety; Production floor; Resource optimization; Solution methods; System unbalance; Technological constraints; Flexible manufacturing systems","","","","","","","Viswanadham N., Narahari Y., Performance Modeling of Automated Manufacturing Systems, (1992); Stecke K.E., Formulation and solution of nonlinear integer production planning problems for flexible manufacturing systems, Management Science, 29, 3, pp. 273-288, (1983); Kumar A., Tiwari P.M., Shankar R., Baveja A., Solving machine-loading problem of a flexible manufacturing system with constraint-based genetic algorithm, European Journal of Operational Research, 175, 2, pp. 1043-1069, (2006); Tiwari S.K.M., Allada V., Solving the machine-loading problem in a flexible manufacturing system using a combinatorial auction-based approach, International Journal of Production Research, 42, 9, pp. 1879-1893, (2004); Swarnkar R., Tiwari M.K., Modeling machine loading problem of fmss and its solution methodology using a hybrid tabu search and sim- ulated annealing-based heuristic approach, Robotics and Computer- Integrated Manufacturing, 20, 3, pp. 199-209, (2004); Geem Z.W., Kim J.H., Loganathan G., A new heuristic opti- mization algorithm: Harmony search, Simulation, 76, 2, pp. 60-68, (2001); Geem Z.W., School Bus Routing Using Harmony Search, 76, 2, pp. 60-68, (2005); Geem Z., Improved Harmony Search from Ensemble of Music Players, 4251, (2006); Al-Betar M., Khader A., A harmony search algorithm for uni- versity course timetabling, Annals of Operations Research, pp. 1-29, (2010); Mukhopadhyay S.K., Midha S., Krishna V.M., A heuristic procedure for loading problems in flexible manufacturing systems, International Journal of Production Research, 30, 9, pp. 2213-2228, (1992); Shanker K., Srinivasulu A., Some solution methodologies for loading problems in a flexible manufacturing system, International Journal of Production Research, 27, 6, pp. 1019-1034, (1989); Nagarjuna N., Mahesh O., Rajagopal K., A heuristic based on multi-stage programming approach for machine-loading problem in a flexible manufacturing system, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 22, 4, pp. 342-352, (2006); Yogeswaran M., Ponnambalam S.G., Tiwari M.K., An efficient hybrid evolutionary heuristic using genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm to solve machine loading problem in fms, International Journal of Production Research, 47, 19, pp. 5421-5448, (2009)","U.K. Yusof; School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 USM, Penang, Malaysia; email: umiyusof@cs.usm.my","","","National University of Malaysia (UKM); Natl.

However, establishing eﬀective manufacturing assembly line operations, in a dynamic manufacturing setting is essentially dependent upon optimum resource utilization while fulﬁlling various constraints and requirements. Consequently, balancing the resources in the assembly line is a complex combinatorial problem, which if not eﬃciently managed, may entail signiﬁcant costs. As such, to facilitate the nature of the assembly line in manufacturing, a new methodology is needed. Bio-inspired methods have been popularly adopted in assembly line where several real-world problems have been successfully solved. Distributed and autonomous paradigm oﬀered by the multi-agent system (MAS) is conducive for addressing the complexity of the manufacturing assembly line. As MAS lacks a self-organization aspect, integration of bio-inspired methods within the MAS paradigm are envisioned, where adaptive and self-organization characteristics are the key ingredients to promote robustness; thus creating a potentially self-reliant and versatile manufacturing environment. © 2016 ICIC International.","Assembly line; Bio-inspired method; Multi-agent system","Assembly; Assembly machines; Autonomous agents; Manufacture; Assembly line; Bio-inspired methods; Complex combinatorial problem; Customized products; Manufacturing assembly; Manufacturing environments; Manufacturing industries; Resource utilizations; Multi agent systems","","","","","","","Leitao P., Holonicrationaleandbio-Inspirationondesignofcomplexemergentandevolvablesystems, Trans.

Advances of the financial time series forecasting had moved from traditional techniques to automated and intelligent techniques that based on machine learning and deep learning. However, many methods of automatic forecasting have been tailored to the specific nature of the time series. As such, a recently introduced Prophet model, which is based on time series decomposition, is adopted with variants of its input parameters and applied to six different financial time series data sets obtained from Standard & Poor’s 500 index (SP500), Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA), China Securities Index (CSI300), Malaysia’s stock market of Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI), Hong Kong Hang Seng 300 index (HS300) and Tokyo’s stock market of Nihon Keizai Shinbun index (Nikkei). The results of the time series forecasting show that the Prophet model is competitive in modeling the actual market movement by simply adopting appropriate parameters where the measure of Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) was 6% at most. In addition, the errors of the forecasting result are also comparable to the results of much more complex forecasting models from the literature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Financial time series; Prophet; Time series forecasting","Commerce; Deep learning; Financial markets; Forecasting; Time series; Dow Jones Industrial averages; Financial time series; Financial time series forecasting; Intelligent techniques; Mean absolute percentage error; Time series decomposition; Time series forecasting; Traditional techniques; Financial data processing","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8014084)","Acknowledgement.

It is difficult to decide which aspect needs to be given more attention when it comes to designing a Website as aesthetics is focusing on the 'look' and 'feel' while usability is stressing on its functionalities. There is no perfect answer which aspects of the Web design are more important than the others. In addition, it is also difficult to have a balance of these two seemingly contrary objectives of Web design. This research focuses on how to balance the aesthetics design and the usability of Web design. This study also investigates methods to evaluate Web page's usability and aesthetic appeal, the role of these two aspects play in the Website design and also the relationship between these two aspects. The results of study provide a tangible concept on how the Web usability and the Web aesthetics design affect each other and methods to balance between the Web usability and aesthetics design. The contribution of this paper is to provide guiding principle to the Website developer in order to develop a Website which is well-balance in usability as well as its aesthetics aspect. © 2010 IEEE.","Aesthetics; Usability; Web design; Web page","Design; Information technology; Usability engineering; Aesthetics; Guiding principles; Usability; Web designs; Web page; Web site design; Web usability; Websites","","","","","","","Tractinsky N., Katz A.S., Ikar D., What is beautiful is usable, Interacting with Computers, 13, 2, pp. 127-145, (2000); ISO 9241: Ergonomic Requirements for Office Systems with Visual Display Terminals (VDTs), (1997); Filonik D., Baur D., Measuring aesthetics for information visualization,  International Conference on Information Visualisation 2008, pp. 579-584, (2009); Zain J.M., Tey M., Soon G.Y., Using Aesthetic Measurement Application (AMA) to measure aesthetics of Web page interfaces,  International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC '08), 6, pp. 96-100, (2008); Tarasewich P., Daniel H.Z., Griffin H.E., Aesthetics and Website design, Quarterly Journal of Electronic Commerce, 2, pp. 67-81, (2001); Mbipom G., Good visual aesthetics equals good Web accessibility, ACM SIGACCESS Accessibility and Computing, 93, pp. 75-83, (2009); Michailidou E., Harper S., Bechhofer S., Visual complexity and aesthetic perception of Web pages, Proceedings of the 26th Annual ACM International Conference on Design of Communication (SIGDOC '08), (2008); Cai S., Xu Y., Yu J., The effects of Web site aesthetics and shopping task on consumer online purchasing behavior, CHI '08: CHI '08 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2008); Lee A.T., Web usability: A review of the research, ACM SIGCHI Bulletin, 31, 1, pp. 38-40, (1999); Ben-Bassat T., Meyer J., Noam, Economic and subjective measures of the perceived value of aesthetics and usability, ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI), 13, 2, pp. 210-234, (2006); Lindgaard G., Aesthetics, visual appeal, usability and user satisfaction: What do the user's eyes tell the user's brain?, Australian Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society, 5, 1, pp. 1-14, (2007); Karvonen K., The beauty of simplicity, Proceedings on the 2000 Conference on Universal Usability, pp. 85-90, (2000); De Angeli A., Sutcliffe A., Hartmann J., Interaction, usability and aesthetice: What influences users'preferences?, Proceedings of the 6th Conference on Designing Interactive Systems, pp. 271-280, (2006); Whitehead C.C., Evaluating web page and web site usability, Proceedings of the 44th Annual Southeast Regional Conference, pp. 788-789, (2006); Holzinger A., Usability engineering methods for software developers, Communications of the ACM, 48, 1, pp. 71-74, (2005); Conte T., Massollar J., Mendes E., Travassos G.H., Usability evaluation based on web design perspectives, Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement, pp. 146-155, (2007); Llanos C.I., Munoz M.N., Design guidelines for web applications based on local patterns, Proceedings of the 2007 Euro American Conference on Telematics and Information Systems, (2007); Calongne C.M., Designing for web site usability, Proceedings of the Seventh Annual Consortium for Computing in Small Colleges Central Plains Conference on the Journal of Computing in Small Colleges, pp. 39-45, (2001); Norman D.A., Beauty, goodness and usability, Introduction to the Special Section.
