Internet of things (IoT), in contrast, is commonly recognized as among the most advanced home security systems. However, the factors that attract young people to use IoT for household security have yet to be examined. Consequently, the purpose of this article is to validate the attitude-social influence-self-efficacy (ASE) model with personal innovativeness and perceived trust. We collected data from Dhaka citizens aged 15 to 24 using a purposive sample technique and 370 valid responses were chosen for the study. According to the analysis, all of our proposed hypotheses were found significant with a 73.6% variance. Furthermore, the effects of attitude and social influence were shown to be the highest and lowest, respectively, and trust and innovativeness were both nearly strong main predictors of ASE. Significantly, since this is one of the few studies in the technology adoption domain using this model, a solid foundation for IoT adoption for security purposes is established. © 2022,Asia Pacific Journal of Information Systems.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to close a research gap by verifying the protection motivation theory using gender as a moderator. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a purposive sampling approach to collect data from Dhaka city, in which 370 valid responses were selected. Additionally, the quantitative and cross-sectional survey used a seven-point Likert scale. Afterward, the evaluation approach included three phases: a measurement model, a structural model and multi-group analysis. Findings: Vulnerability, self-efficacy and response-efficacy were discovered to be critical predictors with a variance of 60.4%. Moreover, there was a significant disparity between males and females in two relationships, response efficacy and intention as well as response cost and intention. Practical implications: This research expands our understanding of Generation Z consumers' behavioral intentions to take measures against household threats, allowing preventative programs to be improved. Further, in the case of applying coping strategies, a practical difference between males and females has been found that must be bridged through awareness campaigns. Originality/value: This study has made a unique contribution to the information system literature. First, the role of protection motivation theory factors in addressing security concerns in homes has been assessed. Second, the coping evaluation process has a greater impact on users' intentions than the threat appraisal process. However, males and females use slightly different approaches to defending themselves against the threat. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Burglary; Gender; Generation Z; Internet of things; Protection motivation theory","Moderators;

Therefore, a NDN-based content routing mechanism was compared with two types of HCN routing protocol implementations in this study: OLSR and Batman-adv. The experimental results obtained from this research provide early evidence that NDN can increase the energy efficiency of MANET compared to the use of HCN primarily TCP/IP on the network stack solution for MANET. Of particular note would be NDN-based content routing’s viability as a solution for energy consumption issues that plague wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks. Last but not least, this paper also provides the future research direction that could be undertaken on the subject. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Energy efficiency; HCN; Host-centric; MANET testbed; Mobile ad hoc network; Named data networking; NDN; OLSR and Batman-adv","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management (telecommunication); Future research directions; Host-centric; Manet testbed; Named data networkings; OLSR and Batman-adv; Prominent features; Reduce energy consumption; Wireless multi-hop; Mobile ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Sarkar S.K., Basavaraju T.G., Puttamadappa C., Ad Hoc Mobile Wireless Networks: Principles, Protocols, and Applications, (2013); Patil M., Naik S.R.R., Nikam V.B., Joshi K.K., Extended ECDSR protocol for energy efficient MANET, 2015 International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems, pp. 1-6, (2015); Shpungin H., Li Z., Throughput and energy efficiency in wireless ad hoc networks with Gaussian channels, IEEE/ACM Trans.

One of the Botnet evasion techniques is by hiding their command and control communication over an encrypted channel like SSL and TLS. This paper provides a Botnet Analysis and Detection System (BADS) framework for detecting Botnet. The BADS framework has been used as a guideline to devise the methodology, and we divided this methodology into six phases: i. data collection, customization, and conversion, pp. feature extraction and feature selection, ipp. Botnet prediction and classification, iv. Botnet detection, v. attack notification, and vi. testing and evaluation. We tend to use the machine learning algorithm for Botnet prediction and classification. We also found several challenges in implementing this work. This research aims to detect Botnet over an encrypted channel with high accuracy, fast detection time, and provides autonomous management to the network manager. © 2013 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization.","Accuracy; Autonomous; Botnet; Botnet analysis and detection system (BADS); Encrypted channel; Machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Cryptography; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Accuracy; Analysis system; Autonomous; Botnet analyse and detection system; Botnets; Command and control; Control communications; Detection system; Encrypted channel; Botnet","","","","","","","Soloman A., Evron G., The World of Botnet, Virus Bulletin, (2006); Security Press Release, Botnets Threaten National Infrastructure and Security, (2006); Thomas V., Jyoti N., Virus Bulletin, Defeating IRC Bots on the Internal Network, (2007); MyCERT Incident Statistics; Zhang H., Detecting Advanced Botnets in Enteririse Networks, (2017); Burghouwt P., Detection of Botnet Command and Control Traffic in Enteririse Networks, (2015); Nicholson P., What Lies Beneath: Advanced Attacks that Hide in SSL Traffic, (2015); Paganini P., SSL Blacklist A New Weaion to Fight Malware and Botnet, (2014); Gebhart G., We Are Halfway to Encryiting The Entire Web, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Reiort, (2017); Finley K., Half of the Web is Now Encryited.

However, the misuse of social media and instant messaging services facilitated conducting different cybercrimes such as cyber stalking, cyber bullying, slander spreading, and sexual harassment. Therefore mobile devices are an important evidentiary piece in digital investigation. In this chapter we report the results of our investigation and analysis of social media and instant messaging services in Firefox OS. We examined three social media services (Facebook, Twitter, and Google. +) as well as three instant messaging services (Telegram, OpenWapp, and Line).

In this paper, the estimated travel duration between bus stops was computed based on historical GPS data with time stamps. Three approaches were employed to compute the duration between bus stops: (i) statistical central tendencies, (ii) nonlinear regression techniques i.e., decision tree regressor, random forest regressor and k-nearest neighbors regressor, and (iii) an ANN predictive model. These three approaches capture different characteristics of the traffic environment. Statistical central tendencies give the overall view of the ETA information while nonlinear regressors can capture context from the time stamps (e.g., weekdays vs holidays). Finally, predicting the duration required to reach the next bus stop based on previous timespans on the same route implicitly captures temporal dynamics of the traffic environment from previous time steps and the ANN predictive model exploits this temporal information. The feasibility of ETA estimation using these three approaches was explained, evaluated and discussed.  © 2023 IEEE.","non-GPS-based ETA models; non-linear models; predictive models; traffic data analysis","Bus terminals; Bus transportation; Buses; Global positioning system; Intelligent systems; Nearest neighbor search; Bus stop; Central tendencies; GPS data; Non-GPS-based ETA model; Non-linear modelling; Nonlinear regression technique; Predictive models; Time-stamp; Traffic data analysis; Traffic environment; Decision trees","","","","","","","(2015); Mackensen E., Lai M., Wendt T.M., Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based wireless sensors, SENSORS, 2012, pp. 1-4, (2012); Gunady S., Keoh S.L., A non-GPS based location tracking of public buses using bluetooth proximity beacons, 2019 IEEE 5th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT), pp. 606-611, (2019); Yu H., Xiao R., Du Y., He Z., A Bus-Arrival Time Prediction Model Based on Historical Traffic Patterns, 2013 International Conference on Computer Sciences and Applications, pp. 345-349, (2013); Zhang X., Liu Z., Prediction of Bus Arrival Time based on GPS Data: Taking 6 Bus in Huangdao District of Qingdao City as an Example, 2019 Chinese Control Conference (CCC), pp. 8789-8794, (2019); Ye L., Thiengburanathum P., Thiengburanathum P., A Real-Time Bus Arrival Time Prediction System Based on Spark Framework and Machine Learning Approaches: A case study in Chiang Mai, 2021 Joint International Conference on Digital Arts, Media and Technology with ECTI Northern Section Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, Cha-am, Thailand, pp. 243-248, (2021); Jenelius E., Koutsopoulos H.N., Travel time estimation for urban road networks using low frequency probe vehicle data, Transp.

However, the misuse of social media and instant messaging services facilitated conducting different cybercrimes such as cyber stalking, cyber bullying, slander spreading, and sexual harassment. Therefore mobile devices are an important evidentiary piece in digital investigation. In this chapter we report the results of our investigation and analysis of social media and instant messaging services in Firefox OS. We examined three social media services (Facebook, Twitter, and Google. +) as well as three instant messaging services (Telegram, OpenWapp, and Line).

While simulation tools provide a simple and inexpensive method to gain an understanding of algorithms and protocols in MANET research, its reliability and accuracy in representing real systems and contexts are critically limited. Thus, this paper unveils the ToMRobot, created with low budget using ordinary remote control (RC) car coupled with a few low cost electronic components, to serve as a fully functional MANET testbed. Provided in this paper are practical knowhow to model and produce ToMRobot from scratch specifically targeted to facilitate less technical savvy MANET researchers. Despite being really economical, significantly inexpensive to create, highly customizable with flexible option that allows researchers to upgrade by utilizing components such as Arduino and Cubieboard2 from technologies that can be sourced from open hardware, ToMRobot still maintains all aspects of MANET rudimentary structures. It is hoped that the guidelines contained within this paper will help MANET researchers to build robots that can be used in their future MANET testbeds, which will in turn ultimately increase the number of MANET researchers who choose testbeds as their evaluation tool. © 2018 IEEE.","MANET detailed; Mobile Ad hoc Network; real mobility; real-testbed","Budget control; Costs; Grid computing; Remote control; Technology transfer; Testbeds; Algorithms and protocols; Evaluation tool; Low-cost electronics; Low-cost robots; MANET detailed; Manet testbed; Open hardware; Rudimentary structures; Mobile ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Lenders V., Wagner J., May M., Analyzing the impact of mobility in ad hoc networks, Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Multi-Hop Ad Hoc Networks: From Theory to Reality, REALMAN '06, pp. 39-46, (2006); Amjad K., From simulation to testbed: An, indoor MANET performance analysis study, Antennas and Propagation Conference (LAPC 2012) Loughborough, pp. 1-4, (2012); Benmoshe B., Berliner E., Dvir A., Performance monitoring framework for Wi-Fi MANET, 2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC 2013), pp. 4463-4468; Cuervo E., Gilbert P., Wu B., Cox L., CrowdLab: An architecture for volunteer mobile testbeds, 2011 Third International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS 2011, pp. 1-10, (2011); Do V.T.M., Landmark L., Kure O., Testbed-based performance evaluation of a connectionless multicast protocol for MANETs, 2014 11th International Symposium on Wireless Communications Systems (ISWCS 2014), pp. 276-281, (2014); Hiyama M., Kulla E., Oda T., Ikeda M., Barolli L., Experimental results, of a MANET testbed in a mixed environment considering horizontal and vertical topologies, 2012 IEEE 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA 2012), pp. 884-889, (2012); Kulla E., Sakamoto S., Ikeda M., Barolli L., Xhafa F., Kamo B., Evaluation of a MANET, testbed for central bridge and V-shape bridge scenarios using BATMAN routing protocol, 2013 Eighth International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA 2013), pp. 199-205, (2013); Kulla E., Ikeda M., Oda T., Barolli L., Xhafa F., Takizawa M., Multimedia transmissions, over a MANET Testbed: Problems and Issues, 2012 Sixth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems (CISIS 2012), pp. 141-147, (2012); Messeguer R., Ochoa S.F., Pino J.A., Medina E., Navarro L., Royo D., Neyem A., Building real-World Ad-Hoc networks to support mobile collaborative applications: Lessons learned, Groupware: Design, Implementation, 5784, pp. 1-16, (2009); Panaousis E.A., Drew G., Millar G.P., Ramrekha T.A., Politis C., A Testbed Implementation for Securing OLSR in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, (2010); Rensfelt O., Hermans F., Gunningberg P., Larzon L.A., Bjornemo E., Repeatable experiments with mobile nodes in a relocatable WSN testbed, Comput.

Using synergistic threats to attack provides many success alternatives that lead to the same goal, which is to take over the network and carry out illegal mining activities using CPU resources from the victim's computer. One of the main motives for the success of this criminal business is its relatively low cost and high return of investment. Using the infection chain method in carrying out cryptocurrency mining malware attacks with fileless techniques involves loading malicious code into system memory. Monero (XMR) is by far the highest popular cryptocurrency among threat actor installing mining malware because it comes with full anonymity and resistance to an application-specific circuit mining (ASIC). This work proposes a better method for classifying conventional malware and cryptocurrency mining malware.

Network traffic forensics plays an important role in cybercrime investigation to detect subject(s) and object(s) of the crime. In this chapter we detect and analyze residual network traffic artifacts of FxOS in relation to two popular social networking applications (Facebook and Twitter) and one instant messaging application (Telegram). We utilized a FxOS simulator to generate relevant traffic while all communication data were captured using network monitoring tools. Captured network packets were examined and remnants with forensic value were reported. This paper, as the first focused study on mobile FxOS network traffic analysis, should pave the way for the future research in this direction. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Malware classification system is important and work together with malware identification to prepare the right and effective antidote for malware. Current techniques in malware classification do not give a good classification result when it deals with the new and unique types of malware. For this reason, we proposed the usage of Genetic Algorithm to optimize the malware classification system as well as help in malware prediction. The new malware classification system is based on malware target and its operation behavior. The result from this study will create a new framework that designed to optimize the classification of malware.

Though, their security is often challenged by adversaries such as Botnet. Botnet leverages the encrypted channel to launch attacks and amplify the impact of attacks. The numbers of Botnet attacks over an encrypted channel are increasing and continue to cause a great loss of money. This study proposes an encrypted Botnet detection technique based on packet header analysis. This technique does not require deep packet inspection and intense traffic analysis. However, the proposed technique requires the analysis of the features taken from the packet header, which are essential for detection. The study endeavors to show that features selected can significantly affect the classification of encrypted Botnet. Therefore, in this paper, the researchers focus on the effects of feature selection on the classification of encrypted Botnet. The researchers use different classification mode (full training and 10-fold cross-validation) mainly by using seven features (7-features) and three features (3-features). Seven features are the number of features extracted from the packet header, and after the feature selection, only three features out of the seven features have weight (value). Therefore, the three features are the most significant features from the seven features that have been extracted. Generally, the result shows that classification with three most significant features provides higher true positive compared to the 7-features classification. Different machine learning algorithms have been used for the classification. Relatively, the results show that the True Positives are higher for 3-features classification than 7-features classification. © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Classification; Encrypted botnet; Feature selection; Machine learning; Packet header analysis","Botnet; Cryptography; Feature extraction; Information dissemination; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; 10-fold cross-validation; Botnet detections; Deep packet inspection; Packet header; Traffic analysis; True positive; Classification (of information)","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/ PKOMP/ 8014017)","This research is supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia through Research University (RUI) Grant, titled “Enhancing Botnet Detection Efficiency and Accuracy using Machine Learning Techniques” (Account Number 1001/ PKOMP/ 8014017).

Particularly immutability, a highly secure blockchain attribute forbidding unauthorized or illicit data editing or deletion, which functions as crucial blockchain security. Nonetheless, the security function is currently being challenged due to improper data stored, such as child pornography, copyright violation, and lately the enaction of the “Right to be Forgotten (RtbF)” principle disseminated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), where it requires blockchain data to be redacted to suit current applications’ urgent demands, and even compliance with the regulation is a challenge and an unfeasible practice for various blockchain technology providers owing to the immutability characteristic. To overcome this challenge, mutable blockchain is highly demanded to solve previously mentioned issues, where controlled and supervised amendments to certain content within constrained privileges granted are suggested by several researchers through numerous blockchain redaction mechanisms using chameleon and non-chameleon hashing function approaches, and methods were proposed to achieve reasonable policies while ensuring high blockchain security levels. Accordingly, the current study seeks to thoroughly define redaction implementation challenges and security properties criteria. The analysis performed has mapped these criteria with chameleon-based research methodologies, technical approaches, and the latest cryptographic techniques implemented to resolve the challenge posed by the policy in which comparisons paved current open issues, leading to shaping future research directions in the scoped field. © 2023 by the authors.","blockchain; chameleon hash; distributed ledger; immutability; redaction mechanism; security","Distributed ledger; 'current; Block-chain; Chameleon hash; Constant improvement; Data editing; Future research directions; Immutability; Redaction mechanism; Security; Technical features; Blockchain","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","The authors sincerely acknowledge and dedicate this paper to the support of the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, and Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).

Network traffic forensics plays an important role in cybercrime investigation to detect subject(s) and object(s) of the crime. In this chapter we detect and analyze residual network traffic artifacts of FxOS in relation to two popular social networking applications (Facebook and Twitter) and one instant messaging application (Telegram). We utilized a FxOS simulator to generate relevant traffic while all communication data were captured using network monitoring tools. Captured network packets were examined and remnants with forensic value were reported. This paper, as the first focused study on mobile FxOS network traffic analysis, should pave the way for the future research in this direction. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, its literature review has not been exhaustive. As a result, the primary objective of this work is to contain a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in PMT in the generic domain, as well as a weighted review of the variables that aid in the theory's expansion. Following that, we independently assessed 138 papers published between 2014 and 2020 in 92 journals and 12 conferences. We discovered an astonishing increase in the number of publications over the last seven years throughout our analysis, indicating that the theory is consuming stability and promise in its application. Additionally, the weight analysis result was attributed to the diagrammatic portrayal of significant and non-significant associations in this study. Weight analysis indicated that coping-appraisal variables had a higher predictive validity than threat-appraisal variables, with self-efficacy being the most effective predictor. Apart from the standard constructs, the most often occurring and heavily weighted factors were Attitude and Subjective norm. Further, the inconsistency of the theory variables has been noted and the inclusion of moderators has been proposed accordingly in this study. © 2022, Success Culture Press.

The arrival of this Firefox OS has created new challenges, concentrations and opportunities for digital investigators. Currently, Firefox OS is still not fully supported by most of the existing mobile forensic tools. Even when the phone is detected as Android, only pictures from removable card was able to be captured. Furthermore, the internal data acquisition is still not working. Therefore, there are very huge opportunities to explore the Firefox OS on every stages of mobile forensic procedures. This paper will present an approach for mobile forensic data acquisition in a forensically sound manner from a Firefox OS running device. This approach will largely use the UNIX dd command to create a forensic image from the Firefox OS running device. © 2014 IEEE.","data acquisition; Firefox OS; Mobile forensic","Computer crime; Computer operating systems; Data acquisition; Open systems; Security of data; Digital investigators; Firefox; Mobile forensics; Mozilla; Open source operating systems; Computer forensics","","","","","Universiti Putra Malaysia","","Firefox OS; Goodwin R., Mozilla's Boot 2 Gecko and Why It Could Change the World; Barmpatsalou K., Damopoulos D., Kambourakis G., A critical review of 7 years of Mobile Device Forensics, Digit.

Cloud computing still faces lots of challenges, topmost is security and privacy of its data. Among of the data security challenges the cloud faces are data (breach, loss, retention, segregation and remanence etc.). But remanence which is the residue of data that still remains in storage after deletion, is a crucial challenge most especially in the cloud and has received minimal attention from the users and CSP (cloud service providers). Data breach and disclosure by unauthorized persons can occur in different forms among of which is improper disposal of data when it is no longer needed. We will be reviewing various work related to data remanence, its challenges, and its prospects. This will help and guide researchers, cloud users, and cloud service providers, etc., in knowing and understanding better this challenge that poses a threat to confidentiality, integrity, and authorization of data in the cloud environment. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","CIA triad; Cloud security; Data breach; Data remanence; Secure deletion","Data visualization; Digital storage; Information management; Privacy by design; Remanence; Side channel attack; Storage as a service (STaaS); Cloud environments; Cloud service providers; Data remanence; Future challenges; Security and privacy; Security challenges; Software and hardwares; Visualization technique; Green computing","","","","","","","Mell P., Grance T., The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing, (2011); Joshi S.B., Standards and techniques to remove data remanence in cloud storage, 1St International Conference on Data Science Anal.

Mozilla Corporation recently released Linux-based open source operating system, named Firefox OS. The emergence of Firefox OS has created new challenges, concentrations and opportunities for digital investigators. In general, Firefox OS is designed to allow smartphones to communicate directly with HTML5 applications using JavaScript and newly introduced WebAPI. However, the used of JavaScript in HTML5 applications and solely no OS restriction might lead to security issues and potential exploits. Therefore, forensic analysis for Firefox OS is urgently needed in order to investigate any criminal intentions. This paper will present an approach and methodology in forensically sound manner for Firefox OS. © 2014 IEEE.","digital investigation; Firefox OS; Forensic Method; Mobile forensics","Computer crime; Computer operating systems; Electronic crime countermeasures; High level languages; HTML; Open systems; Security of data; Smartphones; Digital investigation; Digital investigators; Firefox; Forensic investigation; Forensic Method; Mobile forensics; Mobile operating systems; Open source operating systems; Computer forensics","","","","","Universiti Putra Malaysia","","Gartner says worldwide smartphone sales reached its lowest growth rate with 3.7 per cent increase in fourth quarter of 2008, Gartner, (2012); Gartner says annual smartphone sales surpassed sales of feature phones for the first time in 2013, Gartner, (2014); First look at mozilla's web platform for phones: 'boot to gecko, TechHive, (2012); Lomas N., First firefox OS smartphone has arrived: Telefonica prices ZTE open at $90 in Spain, Latin American markets coming soon, TechCrunch, (2013); Mozilla Announces Global Expansion for Firefox OS, (2013); Firefox OS, (2013); Goodwin R., Mozilla's Boot 2 Gecko and Why It Could Change the World, (2013); Firefox OS Security Overview, (2013); Jansen W., Ayers R., Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics-Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (2007); Distefano A., Me G., Pace F., Android anti-forensics through a local paradigm, Digit.

Therefore, the objectives of this study are to analyze the growth of IoT in recent years and to conduct a weight analysis of the factors that affect acceptance intentions and real usage of IoT-enabled services. For the review, we analyzed 87 publications from 13 conferences and 54 journals published during the period 2014-2020 about consumer adoption of IoT. Following the study, we discovered an unprecedented increase in the number of articles published in the last seven years, which points to an emerging area with an enormous prospect. Furthermore, the weight analysis outcome was associated with the diagrammatic representation in this study. After that, this research developed a generalized consumer IoT adoption model based on the 12 best predictors derived from frequency count and weight analysis, which had the highest predictive power for calculating IoT adoption. This paper further acknowledges the study’s theoretical and practical contributions, as well as its shortcomings, and proposes further research directions for future researchers. © Arif Mahmud, Mohd Heikal Husin, Mohd Najwadi Yusoff, 2022","Diagrammatic representation; Individual-level; Internet of things; Systematic literature review; Weight analysis","","","","","","","","Abushakra A., Nikbin D., Extending the UTAUT2 model to understand the entrepreneur acceptance and adopting Internet of Things (IoT), International Conference on Knowledge Management in Organizations, (2019); Ahmed W, Hizam S.
