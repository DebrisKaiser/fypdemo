By reviewing the literature pertaining to XSS vulnerability, it has been found that many investigations have directed their energy only on XSS vulnerability detection, but not many studies have concentrated on removing XSS vulnerability. This paper embed the removal stage of XSS vulnerability to our previous approach of detection XSS vulnerability, in a way to make the approach fully to detect and remove XSS vulnerability from PHP source code. We conducted two experiments to detect and remove Reflected and Stored XSS vulnerability. The results show that our approach is able to detect and remove XSS vulnerability in PHP source code. More research is required in the field of removing XSS vulnerability from the application source code before deployment. © 2017 IEEE.","Cross Site Scripting; Security Vulnerability; Software Security; Vulnerability Removal; Web Application Security; XSS","Codes (symbols); Computer programming languages; Network security; Cross site scripting; PHP web applications; Security issues; Security vulnerabilities; Software security; Vulnerability detection; WEB application; Web application security; Application programs","","","","","","","Kumar R., Mitigating the authentication vulnerabilities in Web applications through security requirements, Information and Communication Technologies (WICT), 60, 2, pp. 651-663, (2015); Gupta M.K., Govil M.C., Singh G., Predicting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) security vulnerabilities in web applications, 2015 12th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE), Songkhla, pp. 162-167, (2015); Gupta S., Gupta B.B., Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks and Defense Mechanisms: Classification and State-of-the-art, pp. 1-19, (2015); Cross-site Scripting (XSS)-OWASP, (2017); Hydara I., Sultan A.B.M., Zulzalil H., Admodisastro N., Current state of research on cross-site scripting (XSS)-A systematic literature review, Information and Software Technology, 58, pp. 170-186, (2015); Hydara I., Sultan A.B.M., Zulzalil H., Admodisastro N., Cross-Site Scripting Detection Based on an Enhanced Genetic Algorithm, Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8, 30, pp. 1-7, (2015); Guo X., Jin S., Zhang Y., XSS vulnerability detection using optimized attack vector repertory, International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge (CyberC), pp. 29-36, (2015); Ahmed M.A., Ali F., Multiple path testing for cross site scripting using genetic algorithms, Journal of Systems Architecture, 64, pp. 50-62, (2015); Shar L.K., Tan H.B.K., Briand L.C., Mining SQL injection and cross site scripting vulnerabilities using hybrid program analysis, 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '13), pp. 642-651, (2013); Shar L.K., Tan H.B.K., Automated removal of cross site scripting vulnerabilities in web applications, Information and Software Technology, 54, 5, pp. 467-478, (2012); Hydara I., Sultan A.B.M., Zulzalil H., Admodisastro N., An approach for cross-site scripting detection and removal based on genetic algorithms, The Ninth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances (ICSEA), pp. 227-232, (2014); OWASP Project Information: OWASP Enterprise Security API Project, (2010); Malviya V.K., Saurav S., Gupta A., On security issues in web applications through cross site scripting (XSS), 20th Asia Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC), pp. 583-588, (2013); Martirosyan Y., Security Evaluation of Web Application Vulnerability Scanners Strengths and Limitations Using Custom Web Application, (2014); Wang Y., Li Z., Guo T., Program slicing stored XSS bugs in web application, Fifth IEEE International Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering, pp. 191-194, (2011); Wang Y., Li Z., Guo T., Reflected XSS Vulnerability Analysis, International Research Journal of Computer Science and Information Systems (IRJCSIS), 2, 2, pp. 25-33, (2013); Marashdih A.W., Zaaba Z.F., Omer H.K., Web security: Detection of cross site scripting in php web application using genetic algorithm, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (Ijacsa), 8, 5; OWASP Project Information: OWASP Enterprise Security API Project, (2010); Ceponis J., Ceponiene L., Venckauskas A., Mockus D., Evaluation of Open Source Server-Side XSS Protection Solutions, pp. 346-356, (2013); HTML Purifier, (2015)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2017 International Conference on Promising Electronic Technologies, ICPET 2017","16 October 2017 through 17 October 2017","Deir El-Balah","132564","","978-153862269-8","","","English","Proc. - Int.

Thus, it poses to the increasing number of attacks as a result of using various application and tools. Security warning conveys an alert on the potential harm users might expose such as malware and any kind of attacks on their computer. In practice, most of the end users tend to ignore the security warning as it shows the messages repeatedly, although they have been exposed to many risks. A security warning dialogue is supposed to catch the user’s attention and comprehension however, because of users’ past experiences such habituation makes them became less focus. One-to-one interview session with 60 participants was conducted in order to gain further comprehension among the end users experiencing security warning and to investigate the usability issues of current security warning implementation. It is deemed of necessity to discover these usability issues in the current context of security warning presentations. The result revealed that the problems and challenges continue to persist such as difficulties to make a decision, difficulties to comprehend technical jargons, lack of attractiveness of current security warning and issues of habituation or repeated exposures of warnings. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Human-computer interaction; Security; Security warning; Usability; Usable security","Human computer interaction; Malware; Usability engineering; Empirical investigation; Potential harm; Problems and challenges; Security; Security warning; Technical jargon; Usability; Usable security; User experience","","","","","","","Mahajan A., 3.6 Billion Active Internet Users Worldwide by 2018 with Nearly 50% Penetration; Passeri P., Cyber Attacks Statistics; Amran A., Zaaba Z., Mahinderjit Singh M., Usable security: Revealing end-users comprehensions on security warnings, 4Th Information Systems International Conference, ISICO 2017, pp. 635-631, (2017); Wogalter M., Purposes and scope of warnings, Hum.

However, the previous works did not consider the feasibility of the program paths during the analysis detection of input validation vulnerabilities, which led to false positive results. They also needed to validate the usage of the proper sanitization functions for each context of the user input. Therefore, we proposed an enhanced static taint analysis approach to analyse the source code and track the tainted inputs in the program. It started by examining the source code to find the feasibility of each path in the program. The tainted variables were tracked through the analysis until the sink statement, which executes the tainted variables. An algorithm was built to enhance the static analyzer to handle the variables handling functions in PHP. The proposed approach was evaluated with SARD datasets and large-scale PHP programs. The results indicated that the precision in detecting XSS vulnerability was approximately 44% better than WAP and 26% better than RIPS, and its precision in detecting SQL injection was about 10% better than WAP and 19% better than RIPS. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperformed previous symbolic execution studies regarding the number of detected vulnerabilities. © 2023 The Authors","Input validation vulnerability; SQLi; Static analysis; Taint analysis; XSS","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","The authors would like to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for supporting this study.","Ahmed M.A., Ali F., Multiple-path testing for cross site scripting using genetic algorithms, J.

Undeniably it has brought change to the world we live in and to our minds. It has more memory about us than any of the real humans. Social network is a dumpster of peoples' personal information from your date of birth to your current location it has all the information. If process well, this could get even scarier day by day. Motivated by the fact that privacy issue is one of the main concerns of the users, this paper is determined to discuss and elaborate the privacy features settings of the famous Social networking sites (SNS). In this paper we compare three of the most famous SNS, i.e. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The differences and commonalities among those SNS will be compared based on a list of criteria. Based on the comparison, Facebook has been proven having the highest number of flexible privacy features that allow users to choose as compared to the other SNS. © 2020 IEEE.","Component; Privacy; Security; Social Networking Sites; Social Platforms; Usable Security","Facebook; Personal information; Privacy issue; Social networking sites; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Boyd D.M., Ellison N.B., Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship, Journal of Computer-mediated Communication, 13, 1-11, (2007); Dwyer C., Hiltz S.R., Passerini K., Trust and privacy concern within social networking sites: A comparison of Facebook and MySpace, Proceedings of 13th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS, (2007); Schauer P., 5 biggest differences between social media and social networking, Social Media Today, (2015); Global publics embrace social networking, PewResearchCenter, (2010); Stec C., Social media definitions, The Ultimate Glossary of Terms You Should Know, (2015); Whitmore A., Agarwal A., Li D.X., The internetof things; Asurvey of topics and trends, Information Systems Inf Syst Front, 17, pp. 261-274, (2015); Duncan F., So long social media: The kids are opting out of the online public sphere, The Conversation, (2016); Homepage A.; Shabnoor S., Tajinder S., Social media its impact with positive and negative aspects IJCATR, 5, 2, pp. 71-75, (2016); Twitter Shareholder Homepage; Abbott W., Donaghey J., Hare J., Hopkins P., An Instagram is worth a thousand words: An Industry Panel and Audience Q&A, Library Hi Tech News, 30, 7, pp. 1-6, (2013); Salomon D., Moving on from Facebook, Using Instagram to connect with undergraduates and engage in teaching and learning, ACRL TechConnect, pp. 408-412, (2013); Bakhshi S., Shamma D.A., Gilbert E., Faces engage us: Photos with faces attract more likes and comments on Instagram, One of A CHInd, (2014); Jothi P., Neelamalar M., Shakthi R., Analysis of social networking sites: A study on effective communication strategy in developing brand communication, India Journal of Media and Communication Studies, 3, 7, pp. 234-242, (2011); Akram W., Kumar R., A study on positive and negative effects of social media on society, IJCSE, 5, 10, pp. 1-8, (2017); Phoon A., Social media and its stark influence on society, GSW Journal of First-Year Writing, 1, pp. 1-7, (2017); Qi M., Edgar-Nevill D., Social networking searching and privacy issues, Information Security Technical Report, 16, 2, (2011); Gail J., Shehab M., Anna S., Security and privacy in social networks, IEEE Internet Computing, 15, 3, pp. 10-12, (2011); Aljohani M., Nisbet A., Blincoe K., A survey of social media users privacy settings & information disclosure, The Proceedings of 14th Australian Information Security Management Conference, pp. 67-75, (2016); Sieger H., Moller S., Gender differences in the perception of security of mobile phones, Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Human-computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services Companion, pp. 107-112, (2012); Nazir S., Tayyab A., Sajid A., Rashid H.U.A., Javed I., How online shopping is affecting consumers buying behavior in Pakistan, IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 9, 3, (2012); Riquelme I.P., Roman S., Is the influence of privacy and security on online trust the same for all type of consumers, Electronic Markets, 24, 2, pp. 135-149, (2014); Wisniewski P., Ajslam R., Lipford H., Wilson D.C., Framing and measuring multi-dimensional interpersonal privacy preferences of social networking site users, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 38, 1, (2016); Kulcu O., Henkoglu T., Privacy in social networks: An analysis of Facebook, International Journal of Information Management, 34, 6, pp. 761-769, (2014); Stern T., Salb D., Examining online social network use and its effect on the use of privacy settings and profile disclosure, Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society, 35, 1-2, (2015); Zimmeck S., Steven Bellovin M., Privee, An architecture for automatically analyzing web privacy policies, Proc, (2014); Mahmadi F.N., Zaaba Z.F., Osman A., Computer security issues in online banking: An assessment from the context of usable security, NInternational Engineering Research and Innovation Symposium (IRIS) IOP Publishing IOP Conf.

On the other hand, regular computer users tend to ignore the security warning that conveys excessive technical messages which are difficult for them to understand and lead to lack of motivation for decision making. Consequently, an online survey has been utilized by a group of 250 participants to gain general insights based on the user's understanding of security warning. This paper describes one main finding utilizing the Chi-Square test. From the finding, it can be suggested that 2 hypotheses were statistically significant in terms of user's understanding and their assessments towards computer security warning. On the other hand, variable of gender indicates with the highest significant values with three statistically significant 0.004, 0.017 and 0.000 respectively The overall results from the test given indicate that for each variable were connected between computer user's skills and their understanding in order to improve security warning in the future. © 2019 The Authors.","Chi square; Human computer interaction; Security warning; Usability; Usable security","Decision making; Information systems; Information use; Security of data; Statistical tests; Surveys; Chi square; Chi-square tests; Computer users; Online surveys; Security warning; University context; Usability; Usable security; Human computer interaction","","","","","","","Dourish P., Grinter R., Delgado De La Flor J., Joseph M., Security in the wild: User strategies for managing security as an everyday, practical problem, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 8, 6, pp. 391-401, (2004); Zaaba Z.F., Enhancing Usability Using Automated Security Interface Adaption (ASIA), (2014); Krol K., Moroz M., Sasse M.A., Don't work.

However, there is a lack of thorough comprehension of the deanonymise outcome in Tor attack studies. Comparing the attack outcome from one study to another could be ambiguous especially on the anonymity perspective. It is expected that with proper categorisation of the deanonymise outcome, comparison between Tor attack studies in deanonymise outcome perspective could be much more transparent and precise. Hence, this study aims to provide thorough classifications of the deanonymise outcome of Tor attack studies. To achieve that, an in-depth discussion on the anonymity principals that Tor is providing is presented. Then, a set of deanonymise outcome classification is being defined correspond to the current Tor’s deanonymise attack studies outcome. Finally, it can be revealed that over the years, communication entities correlation has received the most attention compared to other categories of the deanonymise outcome on Tor attack studies. © 2020 SERSC.","Anonymity; Attack; Deanonymize; Privacy; Security; Tor","","","","","","School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, (11800)","This research was supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) of Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia (KPM) for ‘‘Security Model: Website Fingerprinting on darknet illegal marketplaces for transaction traffic identification using machine learning” [203.PKOMP.6711803], School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.","Abbott T.G., Lai K.J., Lieberman M.R., Price E.C., Browser-Based Attacks on Tor, Privacy Enhancing Technologies, pp. 184-199, (2007); Almubayed A., Hadi A., Atoum J., A Model for Detecting Tor Encrypted Traffic using Supervised Machine Learning, International Journal of Computer Network and Information Security (IJCNIS), 7, 7, pp. 10-23, (2015); Alsabah M., Bauer K., Goldberg I., Enhancing Tor’s Performance Using Real-time Traffic Classification, Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 73-84, (2012); Alsabah M., Goldberg I., ).

By improving static analysis is necessary to obtain accurate results and lessen the occurrence of false positive results. Being able to detect infeasible paths is useful in the improvement and development of the results of static analysis. However, the process that is used to identify these infeasible paths is not simple, especially because numerous tools and methods still do not have the efficiency in detecting these kinds of paths within the static analysis. This paper investigates the current approaches to detect infeasible paths in the static analysis and discusses the challenges further. © 2018 Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Da Fonseca M., Vieira M.P.A., A practical experience on the impact of plugins in web security, 2014 IEEE 33rd International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS), pp. 21-30;

The web browser threats need to be prevented with their solutions. Cryptography is an area of computer science that provides security for data transmission to make the data more accurate, accountability, authentication, and confidentiality. Encryption algorithm plays an important role in securing the information or data. Different encryption algorithm (symmetric, asymmetric) has been used to achieve the security of data. Yet, those algorithms consume many computing resources such as computation time, battery power and memory. This paper presents the web browser threats and solution for it to make the web browser more secure and shows the most compatible algorithm for the web browsers. At the end of this study, AES is found to be the best algorithm for web browser security as it offers highest encryption rate, smallest memory usage, and currently the most secure algorithm. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

COVID 19's privacy is now the focus of many researchers' attention. The present body of knowledge on privacy for COVID-19 digital technologies has been thoroughly analyzed, and a concise overview of research status and future developments can be gleaned. This paper conducted a bibliometric examination of privacy using the Scopus dataset. Utilizing VOSviewer software, the relevant literature papers published on this topic were examined to determine the field's development history, research hotspots, and future directions. Over time, there has been a rise in the number of studies published in privacy for COVID-19, particularly after 2020, and the growth rate has been steadily increasing. Regarding published research, the United States and China lead the pack. These articles appeared in primarily English-language journals and conference proceedings. Privacy and COVID-19 research was mostly computer science. The most used terms in privacy and COVID-19 were data privacy and humans. This paper examines the evolution of privacy and COVID-19 research and indicates current research priorities and future research goals. Furthermore, the privacy and COVID-19 study seem to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 26 domains. © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Back then, a specific button is assigned as a security lock button such as the asterisk yet major concerns on security issues over personal data stored in mobile phones have been raised. Password-based authentication took over the trend with pattern and PIN unlock being commonly used by users of mobile phones. However, these methods are still prone to fraud as unethical users tend to break the passcode using shoulder surfing or hacking. To further strengthen the security in mobile phones, biometric authentication approaches are proposed. In this paper, four biometric-based authentication methods are being compared through a several aspects. As a result, the most significant biometric-based authentication approach is presented. © 2018 Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Kemp S., Digital in 2017: Global Overview, We Are Social, (2017); Bursztein E., Survey: Most People Don't Lock Their Android Phones - But Should, Elie, (2014); Baldwin R., Don't Be Silly.

Multidisciplinary solutions would be required to introduce equitable security and privacy policy measures to vulnerable communities. Identifying the various requirements of the user community is a major element of this task, as this will be better guarantee that such suggested ideas are compatible with these requirements. One possible approach to resolve this issue thoroughly is to examine the user's mental models which classify the security and privacy concerns. This paper will review a method to address this concern, building on techniques from both human factors engineering and structured methods to construct framework for modelling and investigating mental models of consumers in security and privacy policy domain. There will also be a discussion of possible areas of research using this approach. © 2021 IEEE.","human factor; mental models; privacy; privacy policy; security","Cognitive systems; Computer privacy; Human engineering; End users; Major elements; Mental model; Risk communication; Security and privacy; Structured method; User communities; Vulnerable communities; Privacy by design","","","","","","","Englehardt S., Narayanan A., Online tracking: A 1-million-site measurement and analysis, Proceedings of the 2016 Acm Sigsac Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 1388-1401, (2016); Labrecque L.I., Markos E., Darmody A., Addressing online behavioral advertising and privacy implications: A comparison of passive versus active learning approaches, Journal of Marketing Education, (2019); Urban T., Tatang D., Holz T., Pohlmann N., Towards understanding privacy implications of adware and potentially unwanted programs, European Symposium on Research in Computer Security, pp. 449-469, (2018); Waldman A.E., Privacy, sharing, and trust: The facebook study, Case Western Reserve Law Review, Case Study, 67, 1, pp. 193-233, (2016); Van Alsenoy B., Verdoodt V., Heyman R., Wauters E., Ausloos J., Acar G., From Social Media Service to Advertising Network: a Critical Analysis of Facebook's Revised Policies and Terms, (2015); Cecere G., Rochelandet F., Privacy intrusiveness and web audiences: Empirical evidence, Telecommunications Policy, 37, 10, pp. 1004-1014, (2013); Sismeiro C., Bucklin R.E., Modeling purchase behavior at an e-commerce web site: A task-completion approach, Journal of Marketing Research, 41, 3, pp. 306-323, (2004); Hann I.-H., Hui K.-L., Lai Y.-L., Lee S.-Y.T., Png I.P., Who gets spammed?, Communications of the Acm, 49, 10, pp. 83-87, (2006); Park Y.J., Jang S.M., Understanding privacy knowledge and skill in mobile communication, Computers in Human Behavior, 38, pp. 296-303, (2014); Moll R., Pieschl S., Bromme R., Competent or clueless?

With various attack studies that had been published over 15 years, this paper intends to survey, investigate and classify these studies' paradigm in the perspective of study type, attack mode, target type and mitigation suggestion. Knowledge of these studies' paradigm will allow for an in-depth understanding of the practice, direction and trend of Tor attack studies over the years. In addition, this will present a better comprehension on the diverse techniques used in Tor attack studies. At the end of this study, specific trends of Tor attack studies could be highlighted. Out of 85 reviewed Tor attack studies, only five is non-experimental studies. The most focus attack mode is an active attack and followed by a passive attack. For the target type, the majority of the studies is concentrating on the user as their attack target. Also, out of 85 reviewed Tor attack studies, only 32 studies had discussed a mitigation technique to their proposed attack.  © 2020 IEEE.","analysis; anonymity; attack; privacy; security; tor","Active attack; Attack target; Diverse techniques; In-depth understanding; Mitigation techniques; Passive attacks; Target type; Various attacks","","","","","","","Shirazi F., Simeonovski M., Asghar M.R., Backes M., Diaz C., A survey on routing in anonymous communication protocols, Acm Comput.

The study made use of an online survey consisting of five sections and recruited a total of 564 participants. Respondents were presented with a range of questions designed to measure their experience and knowledge of security. In addition, 2 scenarios were presented to respondents which examined their understanding of security warnings and potential threats, including email phishing and a potentially fraudulent attack through downloading an application. The survey results revealed that end-users are still experiencing significant difficulties with understanding and reacting to current state-of-the-art security applications, messages and potential threats.

However, IoT networks are still vulnerable to threats, attacks, intrusions, and other malicious activities. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that employ unsupervised learning techniques are used to secure sensitive data transmitted on IoT networks and preserve privacy. This paper proposes a hybrid model for intrusion detection that relies on a dimension reduction algorithm, an unsupervised learning algorithm, and a classifier. The proposed model employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features in a dataset. The K-means algorithm generates clusters that serve as class labels for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Experimental results using the NSL-KDD and the UNSW-NB15 datasets justify the effectiveness of our proposed model in detecting malicious activities in IoT networks. The proposed model, when trained, identifies benign and malicious behaviours using an unlabelled dataset. © 2021.

It specifies the functions to notify, to warn and to advice users about the consequence or any possible menaces by allowing random applications to run on the computer system. However, the majority of computer user tends to ignore security warnings that convey excessive technical messages which are difficult for user to understand and lead to lack of motivation for decision making. A survey utilised 250 participants had been conducted to address end-user’s comprehension about the warnings based on their browser’s preference. The results revealed that most users preferred to use Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox as compared to Safari and Internet Explorer. It can be noted that users experienced significant challenges to comprehend the signal icons and technical jargon based on the presented warnings. There is a corresponding need to design a usable security warning that able to ease end-users security decision. © 2020 SERSC.","Human computer interaction security; Information security; Security; Usability; Usable security","","","","","","","","Ahmad F.N.A., Zaaba Z.F., Aminuddin M.A.I.M., Abdullah N.L., Empirical Investigations on Usability of Security Warning Dialogs: End Users Experience, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1132, pp. 335-349, (2020); Amran A., Zaaba Z.F., Singh M.M., Marashdih A.W., Usable Security: Revealing End-Users Comprehensions on Security Warnings, Procedia Computer Science, 124, pp. 624-631, (2017); Amran A., Zaaba Z.F., Mahinderjit Singh M.K., Habituation effects in computer security warning, Information Security Journal: A Global Perspective, 27, 2, pp. 119-131, (2018); Bravo-Lillo C.A., Improving Computer Security Dialogs: An Exploration of Attention and Habituation, (2014); The 'Not Secure' Warning in Google Chrome and How to Avoid It, (2017); Emang D.W.A.B., Zaaba Z.F., Hussain A., Mohd N.A., Preliminary Insights in Security Warning Studies: An Exploration in University Context, Procedia Computer Science, 161, pp. 1191-1198, (2019); Hussein I., Hussain A., Mkpojiogu E.O.C., Nathan S.S., Zaaba Z.F., The knowledge of human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience design (UXD) in malaysia: An analysis of the characteristics of an HCI-focused conference, International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering, 8, 8, pp. 483-490, (2019); Warning Messages, (2018); Warning, (2017); Samsudin N.F., Zaaba Z.F., Further Investigation on Security Warnings Implementation: A Case in Higher Institution, Advanced Research in Engineering and Information Technology (AREITIC)”, Bandung, Indonesia, Advanced.

Trust concerns have been raised and the trustworthiness of social networking sites has been questioned. Currently, the trust in social networks is using the single- faceted approach, which is not well personalized, and doesn't account for the subjective views of trust according to each user, but only the general trust believes of a group of population. From our initial survey, we had found that most people can share their information without any doubts on OSN but they normally do not trust all their friends equally and think there is a need of trust management. By adopting the idea of multi-faceted trust model, a user-centric model that can personalize the comments/photos in social network with user's customized traits of trust is proposed. In this paper, the initial result is analyzed in determining the need to enhance the current trust model within the current social networking.","Multi-faceted model; Online social network (OSN); Privacy; Security; Trust; Trust management","Data privacy; Network security; Security of data; Websites; Online social networks (OSN); Personalizations; Security; Social networking sites; Trust; Trust in social networks; Trust management; User-centric modeling; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Johnston J., Eloff J.H.P., Labuschagne L., Security and human computer interfaces, Computers & Security, 22, 8, pp. 675-684, (2003); Zhang C., Sun J., Zhu X., Fang Y., Privacy and security for online social networks: Challenges and opportunities, Network, IEEE, 24, 4, (2010); Gunatilaka D., A Survey of Privacy and Security Issues in Social Networks, (2011); Brandtzaeg P.B., Liidersa M., Skjetnea J.H., Too many facebook ""friends""?

By using the Tor network, a user can browser without anyone know the truth of the communication information. Numerous studies have been performed worldwide on deanonymizing the Tor user. One of popular study is the Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack, a subset of passive traffic analysis attack. WF consists of complex traffic analytical process with several limitations and assumptions on the Tor network. In this paper, we will discuss the fundamental principal of WF on Tor network, its assumptions and discussion on whether WF is considered as applicable on attacking the Tor user anonymity(especially in real-world scenario).As a result, the applicability discussion and establishment are presented. This study had found that with the advancement of WF attack, it is applicable to be utilized on Tor encrypted traffic and might become a serious threat to Tor’s user anonymity if no proper defense being proposed to prevent the improved WF attack. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

Part of the errors is due to mistakes in the medical record or incomplete medical record which may trigger tragic consequences. In this paper, we present an application that manages securely personal health information on a mobile platform and keeps all the medical records of a patient in digital format. Patients are able to access their medical record at their convenience and the confidentiality of information is guaranteed. Patients are also able to share their personal health record with their respective doctor in a secure way. The application consists of several modules: incognito, access control, privacy control, authentication, encryption, multifactor authentication and emergency control. An anonymous database is created by removing all the identifier of a patient before the health record is stored in the database. This provides an extra layer of protection to the patient’s privacy. In particular, our proposed application introduces the multifactor authentication and emergency control modules which provides a multi-layered defense authentication and emergency case handler respectively. Thus, the proposed application allows the patient to assess their records conveniently and securely, and helps them in emergency situations. As such, the application is suitable for cases involving large number of patients and emergency situations such as in Hajj healthcare management. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","","Access control; Cryptography; Health; Medical problems; Public health; Emergency control; Emergency situation; Health-care managements; Mobile platform; Multi-factor authentication; Personal health informations; Personal health record; Privacy control; Authentication","","","","","School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia","We would like to acknowledge the contribution of the School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia and the support of the Long-Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS), 203.PTS.6728004 from the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education.","Alwan A., Global Status Report on Non-Communicable Diseases, (2010); World Confederation for Physical Therapy, (2010); Gaffar H.D., Achmadi U.F., Syamsu I.P., Hajj health management focussing on the risk factor management, Int.

Despite the ease of doing online banking, there are people that still sceptical in utilizing it due to perception and its security. This paper highlights the subject of online banking security in Malaysia, especially from the perspective of the end-users. The study is done by assessing human computer interaction, usability and security. An online survey utilising 137 participants was previously conducted to gain preliminary insights on security issues of online banking in Malaysia. Following from those results, 37 participants were interviewed to gauge deeper understanding about end-users perception on online banking within the context of usable security. The results suggested that most of the end-users are continuingly experiencing significant difficulties especially in relation to the technical terminologies, security features and other technical issues. Although the security features are provided to provide a shield or protection, users are still incapable to cope with the technical aspects of such implementation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Engineering research; Security of data; Security systems; Surveys; Terminology; Finance management; On-line banking; Security features; Security issues; Technical aspects; Technical terminology; Usability and security; Usable security; Human computer interaction","","","","","","","Furnell S.M., Jusoh A., Katsabas D., Dowland P.S., Considering the Usability of End-User Security Software, Proceedings of 21st IFIP International Information Security Conference (IFIP SEC 2006), pp. 307-316, (2006); (2015); Aladwani A.M., Online banking: A field study of drivers, development challenges, and expectations, International Journal of Information Management, 21, 3, pp. 213-225, (2001); Suh B., Han I., Effect of Trust on Customer Acceptance of Internet Banking.

Where a web application accepts a user-input, it is possible for such vulnerability to inject malicious scripts. The greater part of the literature concentrated on the application of static analysis in order to locate XSS vulnerabilities. The reason for this is its capability of achieving effectively a 100 percent code coverage and observing every path of the program. Nevertheless, the main restriction of static analysis, being the false positive rate shown in the results, continues. Consequently, researchers began to merge static analysis with other algorithms, such as genetic algorithm, machine learning and pattern matching. This is to improve the XSS detection results as well as the static analysis run time. This essay defines the algorithms which formerly improved the static analysis outcomes regarding XSS vulnerability detection. Furthermore, each method's restriction was mentioned in which the studies continue to lack an efficient detection of XSS vulnerability in PHP web application. © 2019 The Authors.","Cross site scripting;

Certain shortcoming leads us to develop a new mobile application to fix the identified shortcomings. Some others include complex navigation of user interfaces, this cause a poor user experience for users. Hence, this project proposes a development of a mobile application that is called CPMA, which serve as a better alternative tool to allow users managing and monitoring information related to conference paper in a more efficient way. This app specifically developed for researchers in higher learning institutions who are needed to proceed with conference paper. Software development methodology named prototyping will be adopted, which consisted of phases such as planning, repeated phases (analysis, design, implementation and system prototype), implementation and final system. The essential significance of this project is to provide a platform for researcher to manage and monitor conference paper in a savvy manner. By the time of completing this project, users are expected to access this application without any costs and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of managing conference paper. To ensure the security is presented in a tabular form for each online marketplace. © International Association of Online Engineering.","Conference paper; Knowledge management; Mobile application","","","","","","","","Mendoza A., Your Desktop Experience Is Not Your Mobile Experience, Mobile User Experience, pp. 11-17, (2014); Williams D.M.L., Collaborative mobile user interface design, Proceedings of the 8th conference on Human-computer interaction with mobile devices and services MobileHCI 06, (2006); El-Rabaie E.-S.M., Difference between conference paper and research paper, Researchgate, (2018); Cheng F., Basic App Structure, Build Mobile Apps with Ionic 2 and Firebase, pp. 47-55, (2017); Floyd C., A Systematic Look at Prototyping, pp. 1-17, (1984); Silva J.A.T.D., On the Abuse of Online Submission System, Fake Peer Reviews and Editor-Created Accounts, 20, 2, (2016); Rashedul M., Rofiqul M., Mazumder T.A., Mobile Application and Its Global Impact, International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 10, 6, pp. 106-107; Ware M., Online Submission and Peer Review System Available, Archives of Ophthalmology, 123, 2, (2005); Bridge P., Appleyard R., A comparison of electronic and paper-based assignment submission and feedback, British Journal of Educational Technology, 39, 4, pp. 644-650, (2008); Lee S.-H., Mobile Phone Culture: The Impacts of Mobile Phone Use, Encyclopedia of Mobile Phone Behavior, pp. 658-672; Clerk Maxwell J., A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, 2, pp. 68-73, (1892); Padmapriya T., Manikanthan S.V., LTE-A Intensified Voice Service Coder using TCP for Efficient Coding Speech, International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering, 8, 7, (2019); Zheng Y., Mobile Phone Behavior in Daily Life, Mobile Phone Behavior, pp. 242-269","A.

There are about 30,000 students at its 17 Academic Schools in USM main campus spanning across a land area of 416.6-hectare (-296 football fields), up to date. Every year, thousands of newcomers enrol in USM main campus have difficulty recognizing new places and buildings considering the area coverage of the campus is wide. There is also a lack of a convenient system to keep the USM communities updated with the latest event information held in the USM main campus. Taking these facts into account, USM Expeditions Kit (U-Trek, a mobile application) is proposed with the aim to provide an interactive mechanism to USM community and/or even to the public to explore the USM main campus and to keep track of events. This allows the USM community and public to become more familiar with conditions of the USM main campus environment and to systematically manage events. Specifically, U-Trek is equipped with GPS navigation, virtual reality (VR) campus tour, augmented reality (AR) interactive camera as well as USM main campus event management functionalities. © 2022 Taylor's University.

This paper discusses a readability issues in privacy policies and how privacy scholars approach the issue. The paper also compares and analyzes research results on readability measurement of privacy policies and divides them into two categories according to different perspective. The perspective includes readability measurement from reader's perspective and readability measurement from privacy policies text content’s perspective. Our finding shows that website providers should give consumers better control regarding their information and give them more freedom in privacy policies. Only then will consumers become liberated from the burden of choosing between 2 unspeakable options.

The purpose of a security warning is to provide a legitimate alert (to notify and to warn) to the users so that a secure manner of action is safely conducted. It is worth noting that the majority of computer users prefer to dismiss security warnings due to lack of attention, the use of technical words, and the deficiency of information provided. This paper determines to achieve two outcomes: firstly, a thorough review of problems, challenges, and approaches to improving security warnings. Our work complements the previous classifications in the identification of problems and challenges in security warnings by value-adding a new classification, namely immersion in the primary task. Then, we add other related works within the known classifications accordingly. In addition, our work also presents the classifications of approaches to improving security warnings. Secondly, we propose two timelines by addressing the problems, challenges, and approaches to improving security warnings. It is expected that the outcomes of this research will be useful to researchers within the niche area for analysing trends and providing the groundwork in security warning studies, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

Online survey utilising 116 participants were conducted to investigate the end-users understanding and satisfaction on E-learning platform in the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM). The results indicate that mainly students still experiencing significant challenges in E-learning platform in regard to accessibility, technical terminologies and functionality. On the other hand, the 10-heuristic guideline is chosen to be a referral point to compare five E-learning platforms in order to assess each performance on regards to the usability criteria. Overall, USM E-learning platform can be considered in a good shape. However, there are more works to be done to improve the delivery system of the E-learning if it would like to sustain for a long period of time. Although the result is at the preliminary stage, it provides useful insights to improve the E-learning platform as one of the most popular education platform in Malaysia. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

Hiding browsing activity is essential for Internet users to increase their privacy. Only Tor users should know the website they are browsing. However, an attacker can utilise the Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack to identify webpages browsed by Tor users. WF is a significant threat to Internet users' privacy as Tor should conceal the browsed webpages' information. Existing WF studies focused on the investigation to improve the identification capabilities, overlooking the systematic discussion and assessment of existing techniques. In addition, existing surveys and analyses reviewed insufficient variation of WF on Tor techniques. Therefore, this survey paper aims to provide a systematic and thorough review of various WF on Tor techniques. First, we discuss WF on Tor techniques in five primary aspects: threat model, victim target, website realm, traffic feature, and traffic classifier. We analyse and classify the reviewed studies on each WF aspect. The classification facilitates in-depth understanding and comparison between WF on Tor techniques. Furthermore, this paper investigates nine assumptions exercised in WF on Tor: closed-world, sequential browsing, isolated traffic, replicability, traffic parsing, passive webpage, disabled cache, static content, and single webpage. These assumptions limit the WF on Tor's practicality in real-world scenarios. Our analysis and classification indicate that most WF on Tor studies apply these assumptions despite being only suitable in controlled environments or laboratory experiments. In addition, most reviewed studies often lack transparency on the assumptions exercised in their studies, risking misunderstanding the WF on Tor techniques' actual practicality. At the end of this survey, we present WF on Tor taxonomy and highlight 21 WF on Tor research's limitations and gaps with plausible recommendations. We also discuss the WF on Tor studies' contribution category and development phase. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Anonymity; Privacy; Security; Tor; Traffic analysis; Website fingerprinting","Network security; Anonymity; Anonymity networks; Internet users; Privacy; Security; Tor; Traffic analysis; User privacy; Web-page; Website fingerprinting; Websites","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/ICT03/USM/02/2)","The Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia supported this research for the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with Project Code: FRGS/1/2019/ICT03/USM/02/2 .

Of late, vulnerability prediction models based on machine learning have been gaining acceptance in the domain of Web security. Such models offer an easy and effective way of dealing with web application security concerns. However, most of them, in particular, rely on complex graphs generated from source code or regex patterns based on expert knowledge. This paper proposed a method for extracting features from source code and predicting input validation vulnerabilities using machine learning algorithms. The proposed method can extract all features related to the flow of vulnerabilities among the programs and remove the features that are irrelevant to the vulnerability flow. In addition, each vulnerability's context has been assigned, providing additional data for our model to use in learning about the vulnerability context. Compared to other related methods, the feature extraction method proposed in this paper has been found to have high reusability and better performance. The best model related to the LSTM classifier had a 98.1% recall rate, a 97.9% precision, an accuracy of 98.67%, and a 99.03% area under the curve (AUC) in the test dataset. © 2022 The Author(s)","Features extraction;

Effective security warning is critical to provide a secure environment to end-users to against attack. However, users always encounter problems and challenges when they encounter security warnings due to the poor warning dialogue interface. Element used in the warning interface is important to support users to make an effective decision. A poor warning design will lead a user to become a fraud victim. Hence, there is a need to design an effective warning dialogue by providing useful security features. Although the efficacy of security warning is depending on the interface of security feature, but also highly dependent on the user’s perception and understanding. This paper determine to investigates further from the end-user’s experience whilst encountering security warnings (i.e. Chrome browser context). An exploratory interview study with 65 participants was conducted to pursue in-depth information about the perceptiveness of users towards current security warnings in three different scenarios. The results show that elements such as icon, colour, wording used in the warning can impact the efficacy of the warning. All the user feedback indicated that there is still room for improvement on the current security warning. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Browser security; Security warning; Usability; Usable security; Warning dialogue","Security systems; Browser security; Security warning; Usability; Usable security; Warning dialogue; Web browsers","","","","","","","Laughery K.R., Wogalter M.S., Designing effective warnings, Rev.

Security warning is supposed to alert users about potential harm which could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system. Apparently, the warning presentations presented to end-users are similar regardless of their background. This paper highlights further investigation utilizing an interview session with 50 participants from the university environment. It provide significant preliminary insights and evidences on what elements that end-users able to comprehend and not. The results indicated that technical terminology became the main issues that made end-users in baffle. Most of them agreed that signal icons should be remained in the warning as risk indicator for them before making security decision.

This attack hampers the adoption and deployment of cloud computing. DDoS Attack is an explicit attempt by an attacker to prevent and deny access to shared services or resources on a server in a cloud environment by legitimate users of cloud computing. This kind of attack targets victim servers by sending massive volumes of traffic from multiple sources to consume all the victim server resources. This paper discussed various defense mechanisms for defending DDoS. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate different mechanisms that help to defend DDoS attacks. This paper highlights the importance of statistical anomaly-based approaches in detecting DDoS attacks. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Anomaly detection; Cloud computing; DDoS; Defense taxonomy","Anomaly detection; Cloud computing; Network security; Cloud computing environments; Cloud environments; DDoS; Defense mechanism; Detection mechanism; Different mechanisms; Distributed denial of service attack; Server resources; Denial-of-service attack","","","","","","","Somani G., Gaur M.S., Sanghi D., Conti M., Buyya R., DDoS attacks in cloud computing: Issues, taxonomy, and future directions, Comput.

The purpose of digital contact tracing apps is to accelerate existing traditional face to face interview method which can control the pandemic effectively and rapidly. A major concern is whether consumers will be willing to download, install, and use the contact tracing applications because of the debate it created about its main attribute like security, privacy concern, system framework, data processing, location measurement. In this paper we discuss the contact tracing apps and its different architecture, then we analyze the framework in term of security, privacy concern and privacy policy. We reported 47 contact tracing applications which are from 28 countries worldwide, with several others expected to be roll out later. We found that 23 percent of contact tracing apps currently implemented do not provide privacy policy in their documentation. We believe that these comprehensive evaluation and specific suggestions will lead to creation and implementation of solutions towards Covid-19 and support governments and mobile development industries in creating safe and privacy conserving apps for contact tracing solutions. © 2021.

However, there is a rising concern on its security. While recent cloud solutions focus on the password-based cryptography, in which a secret key is derived from user’s password, password-based authentication cannot efficiently withstand to password-based attack such as brute-force and dictionary attacks. First, this paper reviews the attack models and security defenses mechanisms of existing public cloud service providers. Subsequently, this paper extends the Honey Encryption scheme to enhance the file storage security on the public cloud computing. The Honey Encryption provides the encrypted data an additional protection layer by providing fake data in response to every incorrect guess on the user’s password. These fake data resemble the actual data and indistinguishable from the attacker’s perspective, therefore hardening the complexity of password guessing. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Brute-force attack; Honey encryption; Password-based encryption; Secure cloud","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/811334)","This work was by a research grant from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [1001/PKOMP/811334].

Security warning is designed to warn the users such as notify, inform and advice users about the consequence effect of an action. However, computer user s tend to ignore security warning due to the lack of attentions, did not understand the meaning of the warnings, difficulties on the technical jargon used, lack of motivation and users become habituated to security warning. Therefore, a survey was mounted online utilising 156 participants to investigate and to understand further general understanding of user's perceptions on security warnings. This paper describes two main findings utilising Chi-Square and Cramer's V test. The findings suggested that in all three scenarios, the results were not statistically significant. However, results portrayed in Cramer's V test were in a better outlook. The result indicates on the need to look closely on each variable involves within the study sampling to improve the security warnings. © 2018 The Authors.","Chi Square; Cramer's V Test; Human Computer Interaction; Security Warning; Usability; Usable Security","Information systems; Surveys; Chi Square; Computer users; End users; Security warning; Technical jargon; Usability; Usable security; User's perceptions; Human computer interaction","","","","","","","Zaaba Z.F., Enhancing Usability Using Automated Security Interface Adaption (Asia), (2014); Bravo-Lillo C.A., Improving Computer Security Dialogs: An Exploration of Attention and Habituation, (2014); Microsoft,Warning Messages, (2015); Wu M., Miller C.R., Garfinkel S.L., Do Security Toolbars Actually Prevent Phishing Attacks, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference of Human Factors in Computing System, pp. 601-610, (2006); Seifert C., Welch I., Komisarczuk P., Effectiveness of Security by Admonition: A Case Study of Security Warnings in A W Eb Browser Setting, (2006); Sharek D., Swofford C., Wogalter M., Failure to Recognize Fake Internet Pop Up Warning Message, Proceeding of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 52nd Annual Meeting, pp. 557-580, (2008); Sunshine J., Egelmen S., Almuhimedi H., Atri N., Cranor L.F., Crying Wolf: An empirical study of ssl warning effectiveness, Proceedings of the 18th Conference on USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 229-416, (2009); Egelmen S., Trust Me: Design Patterns for Constructions Trustworthy Trust Indicators, (2009); Furnell S.M., Jusoh A., Katsabas A., The challenge of understanding and using security: A survey of end -users, Computer and Security, the International Source of Innovation for the Innovation Security and IT Audit Pr Ofessional, (2006); Zaaba Z.F., Teo K.B., Examination on usability issues of security warning dialogs, Journal of Multidisciplinary Engineering Science and Technology, 2, 6, pp. 1337-1345, (2015); Raja F., Hawkey K., Hsu S., Wang K.L.C., Beznosov K., A brick wall, a lock door and a bandit: A physical metaphor for firewall warnings, Proceedings of the Seventh Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 1-20, (2011); Brusoloni J.C., Villamarin-Salomon R., Improving security decision with polymorphic and audited dialogs,  Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 76-85, (2007); Anderson B.B., Kirwan C.B., Jenkins J.L., Eargle D., Howard S., Vance A., How polymorphic warning reduce habituation in the brain: Insights from fMRI study, Processing of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems; Krol K., Moroz M., Sasse M.A., Don't work.

The study observed among others that attendance by practitioners at the conference was comparatively low when compared to comparable conferences in western countries and was also characterized by a low level of knowledge among the HCI-focused conference attendees. The conference was more of a learner’s conference than a conference of experienced experts.

It significantly improves users’ experience during sensing activities since their active involvement in the labeling process is reduced. An unsupervised learning technique such as clustering can be used to automatically annotate sensor data. However, the lingering issue with clustering is the validation of generated clusters. In this paper, we adopted the k-means clustering algorithm for annotating unlabeled sensor data for the purpose of detecting sensitive location information of mobile crowd sensing users. Furthermore, we proposed a cluster validation index for the k-means algorithm, which is based on Multiple Pair-Frequency. Thereafter, we trained three classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Naïve Bayes) using cluster labels generated from the k-means clustering algorithm. The accuracy, precision, and recall of these classifiers were evaluated during the classification of “non-sensitive” and “sensitive” data from motion and location sensors. Very high accuracy scores were recorded from Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers while a fairly high accuracy score was recorded from the Naïve Bayes classifier. With the hybridized machine learning (unsupervised and supervised) technique presented in this paper, unlabeled sensor data was automatically annotated and then classified. © 2018 by the authors.","Activity recognition; Clustering; Data security; Multivariate data; Sensitive data","Location; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Security of data; Smartphones; Support vector machines; Activity recognition; Automatic annotation; Clustering; K-Means clustering algorithm; K-nearest neighbor classifier; Location information; Multivariate data; Sensitive datas; Clustering algorithms","","","","","","","Capponi A., Fiandrino C., Kliazovich D., Bouvry P., Giordano S.A., Cost-effective distributed framework for data collection in cloud-based mobile crowd sensing architectures, IEEE Trans.

Accordingly, it is specifically designed to impersonate a legitimate security alerting function (e.g., notify, warn and advice) to a user about the consequence effect of an action. However, most of the computer users tend to ignore those security warnings conveying the same message over and over again. This eventually leads to habituation. Considering the fact that there is a significant lack of focus been paid to address this issue, the main objective of this paper is to describe and summarize the related studies on users’ habituation to the security warnings. This paper presents a systematic literature review to explore the current key issues, challenges and the possible solutions related to habituation effects in security warnings. It is expected that this paper could contribute to a more complete understanding of the habituation effects in security warnings and eventually bring benefits to the research communities or general publics. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Habituation; security; usability; usable security; warning","Computer science; Information science; Habituation; security; usability; Usable security; warning; Security of data","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6313287)","This work was supported by the short-term grant from the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [304/PKOMP/6313287].","Ahmad R., Improving computer security warnings, a mental model approach in higher educations, (2015); Akhawe D., Felt A.P., Alice in Warningland: A large-scale field study of browser security warning effectiveness, Proceeding of the 22nd UNISEX Security Symposium, pp. 257-272, (2013); Anderson B.B., Kirwan C.B., Jenkins J.L., Eargle D., Howard S., Vance A., How polymorphic warning reduce habituation in the brain: Insights from fMRI study, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 2883-2892, (2015); Anderson B.B., Vance A., Kirwan B., Eargle D., Users aren’t (necessarily) Lazy: Using NeuroIS to explain habituation to security warnings, (2014); Bravo-Lillo C., Cranor L.F., Downs J., Komanduri S., Reeder R.W., Schechter S., Sleeper W., Your attention please: Designing security-decision UIs to make genuine risk harder to ignore, Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS), (2013); Bravo-Lillo C., Cranor L.F., Downs J.S., Komanduri S., Bridging the gap in computer security warnings: A mental model approach. security and privacy, IEEE, 9, 2, pp. 18-26, (2011); Bravo-Lillo C., Cranor L.F., Downs J.S., Komanduri S., POSTER: What is still wrong with security warnings: A mental model approach, Proceeding of the Sixth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, (2011); Bravo-Lillo C.A., Improving computer security dialogs: An exploration of attention and habituation, (2014); Brustoloni J.C., Villamarin-Salomon R., Improving security decision with polymorphic and audited dialogs, Proceeding of the 3rd Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 76-85, (2007); Camp J., Asgharpour F., Liu D., Experimental evaluations of expert and non-expert computer users mental model of security risks, (2008); Craik K.J.W., The nature of explanation, Cambridge University Press, Philosophy, 19, 73, pp. 173-174, (1943); Dourish P., Anderson K., Privacy, security… and risk and danger and secrecy and trust and identity and morality and power: Understanding collective information practices, Report No. UCI-ISR-05-1, (2004); Edward W.K., Poole S.E., Stoll J., Security automation considered harmful?, Proceedings of the Workshop on New Security Paradigms, pp. 33-42, (2007); Egelmen S., Trust me: Design patterns for constructions trustworthy trust indicators, (2009); Egelmen S., Cranor L.F., Jason J., You’ve been warned: An empirical study of the effectiveness of web browser phishing warnings, The 26th Annual CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing System, (2008); Think outside the box, habituation: The “Get Used to It Concept”, (2011); Fagan M., Khan M.M.H., Why do they do what they do?

The traditional way of knowing when the waste will be collected in the housing area is not accurate nowadays as sometimes they fail to collect the waste without any reasons. The platform provided by the waste management company which is through Facebook or their website to make announcement regarding the waste collection process is not so effective as sometimes user missed the news and it is quite troublesome for them to check the website. Hence, to overcome the problems, My Intelligent Bin (MIB) is introduced. The main objectives of MIB are to investigate problems and challenges in waste management system and proposing android mobile application as a platform to manage and monitor the waste management system in real time. In order to meet the objective, QR Code scanning is used as a method for the garbage collection process so that waste management company able to track the waste management process in real time. © 2018 IEEE.","android application; mobile; usability; waste management system","Android (operating system); Bins; Housing; Websites; Android applications; Garbage collection; Management process; mobile; Mobile applications; Problems and challenges; usability; Waste management systems; Waste management","","","","","","","13. 5 Juta Tan Sampah Setiap Tahun, (2017); Mohamad Taha M.P., Integrated Solid Waste Management: Challenge and Future, (2016); Report on the Survey of Environment Protection Expenditure, (2015); Selamat Datang Ke Portal Khidmat Pelanggan IdamanONLINE, (2017); Fauziah S.H., Agamuthu P., Landfills in Malaysia: Past, present and future, Institute of Biological Sciences, (2010); Syed Ali S.A., Harian B., Masalah K Utipan Sampah Tonjol Kelemahan Pengurusan Sisa Pepejal, (2010); Othman R., Kecewa Sampah Tidak di Kutip, (2011); What Is Barcode?, (2017); Anjali S., Parvinder S., A review: Qr codes and its image pre-processing method, International Journal of Science, Engineering and Technology Research (IJSETR), 5, 6, (2016); Prabakaran G., Bhavani R., Raja J., An invisible qr code video watermarking scheme based on wavelet transform and tensor algebra, International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering (IJARCSSE), 5, 1, (2015); Emang D.W.A.B., Lukman R.N.I.R., Kamarulzaman M.I.S., Zaaba Z.F., Usability studies on e-learning platforms: Preliminary study in USM, AIP Conference Proceedings, 1891, 1, (2017); Yen L.P., Zaaba Z.F., Malaycious: Usable mobile food finding application, 8th Knowledge Management International Conference (KMICe) 2016, pp. 284-290, (2016); Zaaba Z.F., Furnell S.M., Dowland P.S., End-user perception and usability of information security, Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Human Aspects of Information Security & Assurance (HAISA), pp. 97-107, (2011)","Z.F.

Tor protect its user privacy against surveillance and censorship using strong encryption and obfuscation techniques which makes it extremely difficult to monitor and identify users' activity on the Tor network. It also implements strong defense to protect the users against traffic features extraction and website fingerprinting. However, the strong anonymity also became the heaven for criminal to avoid network tracing. Therefore, numerous of research has been performed on encrypted traffic analyzing and classification using machine learning techniques. This paper presents survey on existing approaches for classification of Tor and other encrypted traffic. There is preliminary discussion on machine learning approaches and Tor network. Next, there are comparison of the surveyed traffic classification and discussion on their classification properties. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.","Encrypted traffic monitoring; Machine learning; Security; Survey; Tor","","","","","","","","Dingledine R., Mathewson N., Syverson P., Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router,, SSYM'04 Proc. 13th Conf.

To reflect a website's, service's, or app's privacy policies, they're frequently used as a beginning step for researchers investigating the reliability of stated data regulations, user comprehension of policy, or user control methods. It's challenging to collect information about privacy practices from Internet resources like websites and mobile applications for analysis because of the wide variations in the structure, presentation, and content. Most computer privacy studies attempt to test new methods for detecting, classifying, and analyzing computer privacy content. However, numerous papers have been published to promote research activities, and no trace of any bibliometric analysis work on computer privacy demonstrates research trends. By conducting a thorough analysis of computer privacy studies, it searches the Scopus database, which contains over 2000 papers published between 1976 and 2020. Using the bibliometric analysis technique, this study examines research activity in Europe, South America, and other continents. This work investigated the number of papers published, citations, research area, keywords, institutions, topics, and researchers in detail. An overview of the research efforts is followed by listing the words into a classification of computer privacy analysis tools, emphasizing the significance of a computer privacy research study. According to the investigation findings, there are numerous significant implications of research efforts in Europe compared to other continents. Finally, we summarize the review findings for each part by highlighting potential future research directions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE.","Bibliometric analysis; Computer privacy; IoT computer privacy; Privacy; Security","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2023/ICT07/USM/02/1)","The Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia supported this research for the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with Project Code: FRGS/1/2023/ICT07/USM/02/1.

This technique is considered as the most effective tool that is used in human-computer interaction studies to test the usability of information systems. Moreover, this technique is widely adopted to analyze the usability of applications as it is inexpensive and quick.The objective of this study is to use the heuristic evaluation principals to assess the effectiveness of the stock exchange mobile application in Malaysia. Questionnaire survey method was used and data were collected by 25 participants from Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). The heuristic evaluation was conducted by 25 experts to examine the usefulness of stock exchange mobile application. The results revealed that stock exchange application is an effective and useful application that has all required features. Meanwhile, findings also postulated that most of the users show agreeableness regarding the applications of principals of heuristics evaluation in this application. These heuristic principals can further used to avoid the usability gaps in this stock exchange application.This study also gives guidelines to designers for taking corrective measures during the designing of the applications for the stock exchange. Additionally, these guidelines help to provide solutions in the future that how designers may improve the user interface of these stock exchange applications that may improve the experience of users. © 2020 SERSC.","","","","","","","","","Abdul Rahman A.K., Usability Testing for Learnability and Efficiency on UUM Digital Library System, (2012); Adelman L., Riedel S.L., Handbook for Evaluating Knowledge-Based Systems: Conceptual Framework and Compendium of Methods, (2012); Alonso-Rios D., Mosqueira-Rey E., Moret-Bonillo V., A Systematic and Generalizable Approach to the Heuristic Evaluation of User Interfaces, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, pp. 1-14, (2018); Aviles Monroy J., Study on Heuristic Usability Evaluation for Mobile Applications, (2015); Basilisco R., Cha K.J., Uses and gratification motivation for using Facebook and the impact of Facebook usage on social capital and life satisfaction among Filipino users, International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Applications, 9, 4, pp. 181-194, (2015); Baker K., Greenberg S., Gutwin C., Empirical Development of a Heuristic Evaluation Methodology for Shared Workspace Groupware, 96, (2004); Behler A., Lush B., Are You Ready for E-Readers?

In 2017, Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report shows that Malaysia ranks 25th out of 141 countries and fifth best country in Asia. Within Malaysia, Penang has become one of the top tourists visited among others. The Penang capital city Georgetown has widely known for its UNESCO World Heritage recognition since 2008. Despite having such overwhelming responds and recognition, there is still deficiency of technology in tourism industry. Being one of the enormous market growths in technology industry, smart phone has become one of the necessity items. People utilize this platform more in their daily life. Nowadays, there are a lot of applications existed in respective market store that could help the tourists whilst traveling. Nevertheless, in perspective Malaysia, there are only few have been identified. Such applications are MalaysiaTripAdvisor, Pg Tourism, Smart-l. All these applications basically focus on one specific area. Hence, the need to rely on the other applications is obligatory and important. Besides that, there is no planner element that could help the tourists managing their journey in this country. To overcome this, an application called MyTouristPlanner (MTP) is proposed that utilizes the tourist guide features into a single application which help to ease users' problem. The aspects of usability of such system has been significantly improved. © 2018 IEEE.","interactive; mobile application; smart phone; tourism; usability","Commerce; Telephone sets; interactive; Mobile applications; Technology industry; tourism; Tourism application; Travel and tourism; UNESCO world heritages; usability; Smartphones","","","","","","","Visit Malaysia Year, (2017); KUDOS for Malaysia: TRULY Asia CAMPAIGN, (2017); Awani A., Kedatangan Pelancong Meningkat Kepada 13. 03 Juta Orang Setakat Jun, (2016); Malaysia Targets 31 Million Tourists This Year, (2017); Malaysia Eyes $52. 4 Billion Tourism Revenue by 2020, (2017); Isinkaye F.O., Folajimi Y.O., Ojokoh B.A., Recommendation systems: Principles, methods and evaluation, Egyptian Informatics Journal, 16, 3, pp. 261-273, (2015); An Introduction to Recommender Systems, (2016); Li H., Cai F., Liao Z., Content-based filtering recommendation algorithm using HMM, 2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational and Information Sciences on, pp. 275-277, (2012); Umanets A., Ferreira A., Leite N., Guideme-a tourist guide with a recommender system and social interaction, Conference on Electronics, Telecommunications and Computers-CETC 2013, pp. 407-414, (2013); Burke R., Hybrid recommender systems: Survey and experiments, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 2002, pp. 331-370, (2000); The JTDS Project, (2018); Emang D.W.A.B., Lukman R.N.I.R., Kamarulzaman M.I.S., Zaaba Z.F., Usability studies on e-learning platforms: Preliminary study in USM, AIP Conference Proceedings, 1891, 1, (2017); Yen L.P., Zaaba Z.F., Malaycious: Usable mobile food finding application, 8th Knowledge Management International Conference (KMICe) 2016, pp. 284-290, (2016); Zaaba Z.F., Furnell S.M., Dowland P.S., End-user perception and usability of information security, Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Human Aspects of Information Security & Assurance (HAISA), pp. 97-107, (2011)","Z.F.

The associated heavier workloads together with tension and pressure often lead to stress-related health problems. People do really deserve a good rest when they come home from their office. As a result, the proposed solution-The Eye 2H is an intelligent system that will use the technique of image processing and face recognition to detect and analyze the human emotion to control the electronic equipment in their house through an intelligent control box. There are several studies highlighted that by controlling the brightness of light, we could affect the emotion or behavior of humans. Thus, we believe that The Eye 2H is capable to fulfill the main objective of the project which is to provide a better living environment for people in order to provide them a harmony and happy (2H) living life. The Eye 2H is capable of boosting the mood and emotion of the residents by controlling the electronic equipment in their house. The feature of turning on light automatically as well as fine-tune the brightness of light according to human emotion mood will give a 'welcoming home' effect to the house owner. Besides that, The Eye 2H is also a green technology project as it will support the Go Green concept by reducing the energy usage. © 2014 IEEE.","automated light control; lighting effects; smart lights; stress","Automation; Electronic equipment; Energy utilization; Houses; Image processing; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent systems; Luminance; Man machine systems; Oscillators (electronic); Stresses; Energy usage; Green technology; Human emotion; Increasing costs; Light control; Lighting effects; Living environment; Smart homes; Face recognition","","","","","","","Ramos H., Mustafa M., Chin M., The moderating effects of personality on work-family conflicts and stress among Malaysian working parents, International Journal of Management Practice, 5, 3, pp. 225-244, (2012); Allen T.D., Kiburz K.M., Trait mindfulness and work-family balance among working parents: The mediating effects of vitality and sleep quality, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 80, 2, pp. 372-379, (2012); Harris Interactive: 'Stress in the Workplace, (2011); Miller G.E., Chen E., Parker K.J., Psychological stress in childhood and susceptibility to the chronic diseases of aging: Moving toward a model of behavioral and biological mechanisms, Psychological Bulletin, 137, 6, pp. 959-997, (2011); Sanders M.R., Stallman H.M.M., Workplace Triple P: A controlled evaluation of a parenting intervention for working parents., Journal of Family Psychology, 25, 4, pp. 581-590, (2011); Chebat J.C., Michon R., Impact of ambient odors on mall shoppers' emotions, cognition, and spending: A test of competitive causal theories, Journal of Business Research, 56, 7, pp. 529-539, (2003); Laganier V., Pol Der J.Van, Lights and Emotions, (2011); Davis S., Mirick D.K., Stevens R.G., Night shift work, light at night, and risk of breast cancer, Journal of the National Cancel Institute, 93, 20, pp. 1557-1562, (2001); Drake C.L., Roehrs T., Richardson G., Walsh J.K., Roth T., Shift work sleep disorder: Prevalence and consequences beyond that of symptomatic day workers, Sleep, 27, 8, pp. 1453-1462, (2004); Aldrich F., Smart homes: Past, present and future, Inside the Smart Home, pp. 17-39, (2003); Harper R., Inside the Smart Home: Ideas, Possibilities and Methods': 'Inside the Smart Home, pp. 1-13, (2003); Taylor A.S., Harper R., Swan L., Izadi S., Sellen A., Perry M., Homes that make us smart, Personal Ubiquitous Comput, 11, 5, pp. 383-393, (2007); Jahn M., Jentsch M., Prause C.R., Pramudianto F., Al-Akkad A., Reiners R., The energy aware smart home, Proc. 2010 5th International Conference on Future Information Technology (FutureTech), Busan, South Korea, pp. 1-8, (2010); De Carrera P.F., Face Recognition Algorithms, (2010)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2014 5th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology for the Muslim World, ICT4M 2014","17 November 2014 through 18 November 2014","Kuching","110287","","978-147996242-6","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Malaysia’s Halal industry market value is expected to achieve approximately RM614.36 billion by 2025. It indicates that the Halal industry has great potential in covering local and international markets. In Malaysia, the department of islamic development malaysia (JAKIM) is the official agency responsible for Islamic affairs. In most circumstances, the public can check the Halal status of products by accessing the official website. The searching via the website is quite tedious and complex. Therefore, this work bridges the gap by proposing a mobile application namely MyHalal (MH) as a proof of concept which significantly improved the current method. This application will assist users in verifying the Halal status of food products and premises. In this context, MH also introduces a barcode scanner to check the product listing in JAKIM with camera access. Besides that, users also can report an issue when they found any misconduct regarding Halal certification. This mobile application is developed together with the web-based application as the backbone for the administrator to manage technical matters. It is expected to be a user-friendly platform for the users and a channel for JAKIM to manage information and spread awareness about Halal. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Accordingly, it is specifically designed to impersonate a legitimate security alerting function (e.g., notify, warn, and advice) to a user about the consequence effect of an action. However, most of the computer users tend to ignore those security warnings conveying the same message over and over again. This eventually leads to habituation. Considering the fact that there is a significant lack of focus paid to address this issue, the main objective of this article is to describe and summarize the related studies on users’ habituation to the security warnings. This article presents a systematic literature review to explore the current key issues, challenges, and the possible solutions related to habituation effects in security warnings. It is expected that this article could contribute to a more complete understanding of the habituation effects in security warnings and eventually bring benefits to the research communities or general publics. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Habituation; security; usability; usable security; warning","Security of data; 'current; Computer users; Habituation; Key Issues; Security; Security warning; Systematic literature review; Usability; Usable security; Warning; Conveying","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6313287)","This work was supported by a short-term grant from the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) [304/PKOMP/6313287].","Ahmad R., Improving computer security warnings, a mental model approach in higher educations, MSc Thesis, (2015); Akhawe D., Felt A.P., Alice in warningland: A large-scale field study of browser security warning effectiveness, Proceeding of the 22nd UNISEX Security Symposium, pp. 257-272, (2013); Amran A., Zaaba Z.F., Singh M.M., Marashdih A.W., Usable security: Revealing end-users comprehensions on security warnings, Procedia Computer Science, 124, pp. 624-631, (2017); Anderson B.B., Kirwan C.B., Jenkins J.L., Eargle D., Howard S., Vance A., How polymorphic warning reduce habituation in the brain: Insights from fMRI study, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 2883-2892, (2015); Anderson B.B., Vance A., Kirwan B., Eargle D., Users aren’t (necessarily) lazy: Using neurois to explain habituation to security warnings, IS Security and Privacy, (2014); Bravo-Lillo C., Cranor L.F., Downs J., Komanduri S., Reeder R.W., Schechter S., Sleeper W., Your attention please: Designing security-decision UIs to make genuine risk harder to ignore, In Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS), (2013); Bravo-Lillo C., Cranor L.F., Downs J.S., Komanduri S., Bridging the gap in computer security warnings: A mental model approach. security and privacy, Ieee, 9, 2, pp. 18-26, (2011); Bravo-Lillo C., Cranor L.F., Downs J.S., Komanduri S., POSTER: What is still wrong with security warnings: A mental model approach, In Proceeding of the Sixth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, (2011); Bravo-Lillo C.A., Improving computer security dialogs: An exploration of attention and habituation, PhD Thesis)., (2014); Brustoloni J.C., Villamarin-Salomon R., Improving security decision with polymorphic and audited dialogs, Proceeding of the 3rd Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, pp. 76-85, (2007); Camp J., Asgharpour F., Liu D., Experimental evaluations of expert and non-expert computer users mental model of security risks, (2008); Craik K.J.W., The nature of explanation Philosophy, 19, 73, pp. 173-174, (1943); Privacy, Security … and Risk and Danger and Secrecy and Trust and Identity and Morality and Power: Understanding Collective Information Practices.

Security warning is a form of message conveyed to inform user on the risk of allowing an application to run on the computer system. Security warning plays an important role in notify, warn and advise user about the potential result of an action beforehand. However, security warnings are often being ignored due to various reasons such as poor design of security warnings and too many technical terms used in security warnings. This research highlights insights into the discovery of problems and difficulties encountered by the users, approaches in improving security warnings and future direction of the security warning improvement process. We proposed to utilise the hybrid approach of iterative design and mental model in the effort to enhance the current implementation of security warning. Iterative design is a cyclic design process where prototyping, testing and refining are done repeatedly. A mental model is a person's psychological representation of how they perceive and understand something. It is expected that this paper would benefit the researchers to comprehend approches and challenges to improve security warnings.","Security; Security Dialogues; Security Warning; Usability; Usable Security","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6313287)","Token of appreciation to those participate directly or indirectly for in this work.

This study provides an empirical model to detect individual terrorist using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profiling. In the research design and analysis approach, four metric values of DNA materials guanine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine form a dataset were assigned to a sample of a hundred people and tested using regression analysis. The tests were conducted to generate a mathematical model that minimizes errors in the experiment. After model evaluations and validations, the result shows 99.43% detection rate accuracy. The model was used to measure the weight of individual involvement in crime such as cybercrime, and terrorism as presented by the people’s DNA test. The result from this study performs better when compared with the recent studies of other state-of-the-art techniques such as text analysis, machine learning algorithms, data mining, high efficiency video coding detection and statistical mixture models identification. Therefore, we proposed an empirical model using DNA profiling for identifying individuals involved in terrorism to enable empirical evidence in a forensic investigation. © IAEME Publication.","Crime detection; Empirical model; Individual DNA profiling; Terrorism","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","We thank the School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Penang, Malaysia.

They encounter security warnings on daily basis in many situations when dealing with their computer. However, prior studies have shown that users often have difficulty in understanding the warnings, which can pose a particular risk in cases where they are required to make a decision. Well gathered information is needed to help the researchers and other people to further understand this area. This paper describes an overview of studies on security warnings. It covers problems that end users encounter with security warnings, possible solutions and approaches of security warnings and useful classification of security warnings studies.

However, due to security and usability issues, only 29% of users convert their online search into a purchase. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the existing evaluation models in the aspect of usability and security dimensions for an e-commerce website. This study reviewed the evaluation models that have been applied to E-commerce from the year 2000 to 2018. The study reviewed 11 models and listed the usability and security elements evaluated by each model. The strength and weakness of each model was highlighted. This study found that there is a lack of one comprehensive model that is able to measure all the usability components together with the security components. There is a need to design an evaluation model that will be able to evaluate usability and security together for e-commerce website in order to improvise the e-commerce website. © 2019 The Authors.","E-commerce; Security; Usability","Electronic commerce; Information systems; Information use; Usability engineering; Websites; Comprehensive model; E-commerce websites; Evaluation modeling; Security; Security and usabilities; Security components; Usability; Usability and security; Web Design","","","","","","","Kraemer K.L., Dedrick J., Melville N., Zhu K., Global E-Commerce:Impacts of National Environments and Policy, (2006); Rainer K., Cegielski C., Introduction to Information Systems: Enabling and Transforming Business, Third Edition, (2011); Laudon K.C., Traver C.G., E-Commerce: Business, Technology, (2002); Nielsen J., Usability 101: Introduction to Usability, (2003); Nielsen J., Norman D., Web-Site Usability: Usability on the Web Isn'T A Luxury, (2000); Jokela T., Usability capability models - Review and analysis, HCI 2000, (2000); Samsudin N.F., Zaaba Z.F., Singh M.M., Samsudin A., Symbolism in computer security warnings: Signal icons and signal words, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA), 7, 10, pp. 148-153, (2016); Zaaba Z.F., Furnell S.M., Dowland P.S., A study on improving security warnings, The 5th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology for the Muslim World (ICT4M), pp. 1-5, (2016); Samsudin N.F., Zaaba Z.F., Security warning life cycle: Challenges and Panacea, Journal of Telecommunication, Electronic and Computer Engineering (JTEC), 9, 2-5, pp. 53-57, (2017); Amran A., Zaaba Z.F., Singh M.K.M., Habituation effects in computer security warning, Information Security Journal: A Global Perspectives, 27, 2, pp. 119-131, (2018); Amran A., Zaaba Z.F., Singh M.K.M., Marashdi A.W., Usable security: Revealing end-users comprehensions on security warnings, Procedia Computer Science, 1124, pp. 624-631, (2017); Li F., Li Y., Usability evaluation of e-commerce on B2C websites in China, Procedia Engineering, 15, pp. 5299-5304, (2011); Systems and Software Engineering - Systems and Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) - System and Software Quality Models, (2011); Seffah A., Metzker E., The obstacles and myths of usability and software, Communications of the ACM, 47, 12, pp. 71-76, (2004); Pastore M., Europeans Increasingly Turn to the Net for Travel, (2001); Matera M., Rizzo F., Toffetti Carughi G., Web usability: Principles and evaluation methods, Web Engineering, pp. 143-180, (2006); Padmali P., Kulkarni D., Mawatha C., Implications of trust and usability on e-commerce adoption, International Journal of Business and Information, 10, 4, pp. 519-556, (2015); Teltzrow M., Kobsa A., Impacts of user privacy preferences on personalized systems: A comparative study, Designing Personalized UserExperiences for eCommerce, pp. 315-332, (2004); Prasad P.S., Padhy N., Panigrahi R., Security issues over e-commerce and their solutions, IJARCCE, 5, pp. 81-85, (2016); Pavlou P., Integrating trust in electronic commerce with the technology acceptance model: Model development and validation, AMCIS Proceedings, (2001); Chandler K., Hyatt K., Customer-Centred Design A New Approach to Web Usability, (2003); Zaaba Z.F., Furnell S.M., Dowland P.S., End-user perception and usability of information security, Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Human Aspects of Information Security and Assurance (HAISA), pp. 97-107, (2011); Gray W.D., Salzman M.C., Damaged merchandise?

From the big mall to a small shop, many security measures have been put in place as prevention tools. Apparently, there are numbers of shoplifting prevention tools in the market such as the Closedcircuit Television (CCTV), Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) and Future Attribute Screening Technology (FAST). However, the cost issues and the ease of use always become the main concerns for the shopkeepers. Therefore CCTV was widely accepted because of the ease and affordable price. Although the CCTV is their main preference, it can be noted that CCTV operates in a static way where it can only records and monitor the incidents. This paper highlights the conventional CCTV issues and proposes the Intelligent Responsive Indoor System (IRiS) the as security crime prevention tool that uses face detection, recognition and behavior analysis to detect potential shoplifting intentions. Six small shop owners were interviewed to understand their insights on the problems and the need to further enhance the current CCTV. In addition, detailed discussions were provided in relation to the development of IRiS. Therefore, it can be suggested that IRiS provides a significant foundation and promises to be a security prevention tool to improve the conventional functions of the CCTV.","Biometrics; Face recognition; Human computer interaction; Intelligent system; Security; Security alerts","","","","","","","","Shoplifter goes through checkout with 32 stolen iphones, (2015); Ahonen T., Hadid A., Pietikainen M., Face recognition with Local Binary Pattern, Lecturer Notes in Computer Science, 3021, pp. 469-481, (2004); Arigbabu O.A., Syed Ahmad S.M., Wan Adnan W.A., Yussof S., Mahmood S., Soft biometric: Gender recognition from unconstrained face images using local feature descriptor, Journal of ICT, 14, pp. 111-122, (2015); Electronic article surveillance, (2015); Belhumeur P.N., Hespanha J.P., Kriegman D.J., Eigenfaces vs, Fisherfaces: Recognition using class specific linear projection.

A sufficiently large and clean dataset is essential for quality and accurate WFP experiments. Thus, there is a corresponding need to automate the dataset collection, filtering, and validation processes. This work introduces a new paradigm, WFP-Collector, an automatic dataset collection framework for WFP experiments. WFP-Collector enables researchers to automatically (1) create a visit database for webpage crawling, (2) collect various data and log for in-depth analysis, (3) webpage visits in tablet and mobile browsing modes, (4) throttle network bandwidth and latency performance, (5) validate and filter the collected data, (6) compress and upload the collected data to cloud storage, and (7) completion notification using Telegram and email. We developed a proof-of-concept of the WFP framework for simulation and comparison. We found that the WFP-Collector framework collects nine data items and produces over 55% larger collected data size than existing approaches. The captured packet size in tablet and mobile browsing modes is up to 57.5% smaller than in desktop mode. Moreover, the file compression in WFP-Collector can reduce up to 39.9% of the storage space required for data collection. © 2023 The Authors","Dataset Collection Framework; Privacy; Security; Tor Browser; Webpage Crawling; Website Fingerprinting","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","The authors would like to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for supporting this study.","Acar G., Juarez M., (2023); Almubayed A., Hadi A., Atoum J., A Model for Detecting Tor Encrypted Traffic using Supervised Machine Learning, Int.

Static analysis has the ability to observe all possible software paths in an application through the scrutiny of a web application’s source code. Among those paths, some may be considered feasible paths, which refer to any paths that the test cases can execute. The detection of feasible paths in the results of a static analysis helps to minimize the false positive rate. However, the detection of feasible paths can be challenging, especially for programs that have multiple conditions in the same branch. The aim is to ensure that each feasible path is detected only once (not duplicated). This paper proposes an approach based on minimal static single assignment (MSSA) form and symbolic execution to detect feasible paths. The proposed approach starts by converting the source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST), followed by converting the AST to minimal SSA representation, which helps to decrease the number of instructions in the SSA form. An algorithm was built to examine all of the instructions of the SSA form, identify whole paths in the source code, and extract constraints along each path. A path weight method (PWM) is proposed in this work to avoid detecting duplicated feasible paths. The satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solver was used to check the satisfiability of each path condition. The proposed approach was tested on seven well-known test programs that have been used in related studies and 10 large scale programs. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method (PWM) can avoid detecting duplicated feasible paths, and the proposed approach reduced the time required for generating the paths compared to that in related studies. © 2021 by the authors.

A number of the most commonly utilised frameworks for web applications are written in PHP. They became main targets because a vast number of servers are running these applications throughout the world. This increase in web application utilisation has made it more attractive to both users and hackers. According to the latest web security reports and research, cross site scripting (XSS) is the most popular vulnerability in PHP web application. XSS is considered an injection type of attack, which results in the theft of sensitive data, cookies, and sessions. Several tools and approaches have focused on detecting this kind of vulnerability in PHP source code. However, it is still a current problem in PHP web applications. This paper describes the popularity of PHP technology among other technologies, and highlight the approaches used to detect the most common vulnerabilities on PHP web applications, which is XSS. In addition, the discussion and the conclusion with future direction of research within this domain are highlighted. © 2018 IEEE.","Cross Site Scripting; Software Security; Vulnerability; Web Application Security; XSS","Network security; Personal computing; Cross site scripting; Current problems; PHP web applications; Sensitive datas; Software security; Vulnerability; WEB application; Web application security; Application programs","","","","","","","Yusof I., Al-Sakib K.P., Mitigating cross-site scripting attacks with a content security policy, Computer, 49, pp. 56-63, (2016); Shar L.K., Briand L.C., Tan H.B.K., Web application vulnerability prediction using hybrid program analysis and machine learning, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 12, pp. 688-707, (2015); Deepa G., Thilagam P.S., Securing web applications from injection and logic vulnerabilities: Approaches and challenges, Information and Software Technology, 74, pp. 160-180, (2016); Veracode, State of Software Security 2016; Wassermann G.M., Techniques and Tools for Engineering Secure Web Applications, (2008); Bounnady K., Phanthavong K., Pathoumvanh S., Sihalath K., Comparison the processing speed between PHP and ASP.
