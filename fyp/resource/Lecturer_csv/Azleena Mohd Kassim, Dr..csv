However, studies have revealed that despite the important roles of cloud computing, most libraries in higher educational institutions in some West African Countries have not adopted the technology. Additionally, existing empirical studies on the adoption of cloud computing in English-speaking countries of West African academic libraries are low and vary from one country to another as well as from one geo-political region to the other. This necessitates the need to explore the existing empirical studies which were carried out on the adoption of cloud computing level and its impact in academic libraries in West Africa such as Ghana, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Several online academic databases were used as sources of data for this study using relevant keywords. As such, this study reviewed the existing empirical research on cloud computing acceptance within West Africa which revealed varying results concerning cloud computing acceptance in academic libraries. results revealed that the majority of the existing studies of cloud computing in academic libraries were found to be focused in Nigeria, and the findings further revealed that the Southern and Eastern parts of Nigeria have more studies compared to the other parts. Based on this outcome, this study recommends additional empirical study to be conducted on cloud computing adoption among the Anglophone Countries of West African academic libraries, as the factors for technology adoption may likely differ from one area to the other. © 2023 SPIE.","academic libraries; Anglophone countries; Cloud computing adoption; factors for cloud technology adoption; Nigerian academic libraries; West African countries","Libraries; Academic libraries; Anglophone country; Cloud computing adoption; Cloud technologies; Cloud-computing; Factor for cloud technology adoption; Nigerian academic library; Nigerians; Technology adoption; West african country; Cloud computing","","","","","","","Ahmad S.

Metaheuristic algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) are known to be used in many RS to provide optimal and good recommendations. Both algorithms are designed based on nature-inspired events, where GA is designed based on the natural evolution process while ACO is based on ants’ behaviour in their natural habit. In this paper, both GA and ACO algorithms were implemented in a restaurant RS and evaluated by using the restaurant’s attributes, which was then followed by a list of recommended restaurants as the output. With the highest score of 99.64% of accuracy, GA overtakes ACO in terms of recommendation accuracy while ACO computed 67.12% lesser runtime than GA. Considering the results acquired, a new hybrid framework known as the HGA-ACO algorithm was proposed. The proposed HGA-ACO has a recommendation accuracy of 99.57% and achieved a 31.37% runtime reduction from GA. Thus, the proposed framework was observed to have improved the output accuracy of ACO and improved the processing time in GA, thus, improving the overall efficiency of the RS. © 2022,ASM Science Journal.

This study focuses on factors affecting the adoption of digital dental technologies and dental informatics in dental practice. There are limited studies in the literature on factors that affect the adoption of digital dental technologies (DDT) and dental informatics (DI). Understanding the factors is important for the success of the adoption of technologies. Therefore, this study aims to fill that gap. This paper reviews peer-reviewed literature to analyze factors that affect the adoption of digital dental technologies (DDT) and dental informatics (DI) and critically examines an array of technology acceptance models to unveil the underlying determinants of DDT and DI adoption.

Coalition formation is an approach dedicated to achieve optimal group arrangement. We are working in the direction of identifying strategies to build a coalition formation system taking into consideration the social factors. Computational cultural dynamics (CCD) is a research area that intertwines computer technology with behavioural and social sciences. We find that this research has potential to be further expanded to study and build a group setting. At the same time, the value of knowledge is seen as an important factor to determine the success of such coalition especially from the social aspect. Therefore, with the motivation to achieve a CCD perspective of a knowledge based coalition formation, social factors are studied, where the knowledge derived from this process will be identified, represented and stored. In this paper, we present a framework for the knowledge based coalition formation focusing on structuring the social factors chosen to initiate the knowledge process of the coalition formation system. © 2010 IEEE.","Coaltion formation; Knowledge management; Ontology; Social factors","Information technology; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Ontology; Social aspects; Coalition formations; Coaltion formation; Collaborative teams; Computer technology; Knowledge process; Research areas; Social factor; Specific tasks; Knowledge representation","","","","","","","Housel T., Bell A.H., Measuring and Managing Knowledge, (2001); Turban E., Aronson J.E., Decision Support Systems and Intelligent Systems, (2001); Awadand E.M., Ghaziri H.M., Knowledge Management, (2004); Nau D., Wilkenfeld J., Computational cultural dynamics, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 23, 4, pp. 18-19, (2008); Marwick A.D., Knowledge management technology, IBM Systems Journal: Knowledge Management, 40, 4, pp. 814-830, (2001); Thomas J.C., Kellogg W.A., Erickson T., The knowledge management puzzle: Human and social factors in knowledge management, IBM Systems Journal: Knowledge Management, 40, 4, pp. 863-884, (2001); Von Neumann J., Morgenstern O., Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour, (1953); Konishi H., Ray D., Coalition formation as a dynamic process, Journal of Economic Theory, 110, pp. 1-41, (2003); Chong Y.H., Cheah Y.N., Credibility-chart and dual-memory referencing for robust and efficient agent search in coalition formation, Proceedings of International Conference on Intelligent Knowledge Systems, (2004); Gamson W.A., A theory of coalition formation, American Sociological Review, 26, 3, pp. 373-382, (1961); Hanneman R.A., Riddle M., Introduction to Social Network Methods; Wellman B., Berkowitz S.D., Social Structures: A Network Approach, (1998); Baninajarian N., Abdullah Z., Groups in context: A model of group effectiveness, European Journal of Social Sciences, 8, 2, pp. 335-340, (2009); Klusch M., Gerber A., Dynamic coalition formation among rational agents, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 17, 3, pp. 42-47, (2002); Chong Y.H., Cheah Y.N., Forming cohesive coalitions using virtual social network and adaptive resonance theory, IADIS International Conference e-Society 2005, pp. 651-655, (2005); Allsopp D.N., Beautement P., Kirton M., Bradshaw J.M., Suri N., Durfee E.H., Knoblock C.A., Tate A., Thompson C.W., Coalition agents experiment: Multiagent cooperation in international coalitions, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 17, 3, pp. 26-35, (2002); Marmelstein R.E., Force templates: A blueprint for coalition interaction within an infosphere, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 17, 3, pp. 36-41, (2002); Pechoucek M., Marik V., Barta J., Guest Editors' introduction: A knowledge-based approach to coalition formation, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 17, 3, pp. 14-16, (2002); Reffay C., Chanier T., How social network analysis can help to measure cohesion in collaborative distance learning, Proceedings of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning, pp. 343-352, (2003); Macy M.W., Willer R., From factors to actors: Computational sociology and agent-based modeling, Annual Review of Sociology, 28, pp. 143-166, (2002); Gabora L., Modeling cultural dynamics, Proceedings of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Fall Symposium, pp. 18-25, (2008); Harvey C.M., Koubek R.J., Cognitive, social and environment attributes of distributed engineering collaboration: A review and proposed model of collaboration, Human Factors and Ergonomics in Manufacturing, 10, 4, pp. 369-393, (2000); Sicilia M.A., Lytras M., Rodriguez E., Garcia- Barriocanal E., Integrating descriptions of knowledge management learning activities into large ontological structures: A case study, Data & Knowledge Engineering, 57, 2, pp. 111-121, (2006); Gruber T.R., A translation approach to portable ontology specifications, Knowledge Acquisition, 5, 2, pp. 199-220, (1993); Vasconcelos J., Kimble C., Gouveia F., Kudenko D., A group memory system for corporate knowledge management, an ontological approach, Proceedings of the 1st European Conference on Knowledge Management (ECKM'2000), pp. 91-99, (2000); Keyton J., Communicating in Groups: Building Relationships in Groups; Peeters M.A.G., Van Tuijl H.F.J.M., Rutte C.G., Reymen I.M.M.J., Personality and team performance: A meta-analysis, European Journal of Personality, 20, 5, pp. 377-396, (2006); Hashim I.H.M., The development of social network at workplace for new teachers, Kajian Malaysia, 12, 2, (2004); Yao H., Orme A.M., Etzkorn L., Cohesion metrics for ontology design and application, Journal of Computer Science, 1, 1, pp. 107-113, (2005)","","","","IEEE","2010 International Symposium on Information Technology, ITSim'10","15 June 2010 through 17 June 2010","Kuala Lumpur","81915","","978-142446718-1","","","English","Proc.

Hence, this paper proposed a genetic algorithm-based approach to automate group formation based on student demography to assign students to their academic advisors. The genetic algorithm (GA) will optimize the group formation of students with a balanced number of nationalities, races, and genders. Also, this paper examines the user acceptance of the proposed genetic algorithm-based application to automate group formation using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework. The survey aims to study the impact of independent and moderating variables on dependent variables. The result proved that all the independent variables, Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), and Facilitating Condition (FC), have a positive impact on the dependent variable, Behavioral Intention (BI). In contrast, the moderating variable Experience (EX) and Voluntariness of Use (VU) have a negative impact on Behavioral Intention (BI). Thus, this paper concludes that the proposed application can increase the performance and efficiency of group formation and automatically assign students to academic advisors. However, respondents are reluctant and not ready to use the system. Thus, training and workshops can be conducted to introduce and train the users to utilize the system. Future works can be done where the application of the proposed genetic algorithm-based system can be further expanded to different academic purposes such as team formation for group assignment and team member selection for competition. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

In addition, studies on digital dental technologies (DDT) and dental informatics (DI) usually report clinical outcomes and benefit outcomes separately for each technology, not integrated into a single study for all digital technologies in dental practice. Knowing the clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and benefits-related impacts of the adoption of DDT and DI could provide useful information for stakeholders in the adoption of these technologies. The purpose of this literature review was to identify digital dental technologies (DDT) and dental informatics (DI) and investigate the benefits and impacts of these technologies in dental practice. The study has provided a conceptual framework for digital dental technologies and dental informatics that have been adopted in dental practices. The conceptual framework has covered most dental informatics systems and digital dental technologies. There are several benefits to using dental digital technology in dental services, including prevention, treatment planning, analysis, clinical diagnosis, treatment, maintenance, research, and education, as well as virtual treatments. That leads to increased patient satisfaction, improved results, safety, productivity, and duration of treatment. The implementation of digital technology in dental practice carries several benefits. Informatics and digital technologies in each sub-specialty of dentistry give various options and are strong enablers to carry out dentistry more effectively and safely in general. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

A team’s performance may have a negative effect when a team is formed randomly. Moreover, it is quite impossible to achieve an optimal team manually as the formation can expand into countless possibilities. Hence, this paper presents a decision-making framework for collaborative team formation by incorporating Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithm (Fuzzy-GA). The framework has been initiated by combining effective team formation factors such as skills, trust, leadership, and individual performance. Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is utilised to survey the readiness and technology acceptance of the organisations’ employees in adopting the proposed decision-making approach to form a collaborative team. The UTAUT survey had proven that behavioural intention (BI) had a positive impact on the performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI) and facilitating conditions (FC). However, behavioural intention (BI) had a negative impact on the voluntariness of use (VU); thus the transformation of collaborative team formation must be further explored to increase the team’s voluntarism towards this automated collaborative team formation © 2021.

Therefore, this research combines two technology adoption theories of technology-organizational-environmental and diffusion of innovation (TOE-DOI) theories to identify the influencing factors and develop a model for the adoption of cloud computing in academic libraries. A quantitative technique using survey design was adopted and previously used scales were adapted and formulated structured questionnaires. The study population comprises decision-makers from North-Eastern Nigerian academic libraries and purposive sampling was used in selecting 212 sample respondents where 192 were found usable. Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) and Partial Least Square–Structured Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used for analyzing the data. Findings revealed that all the independent variables (relative advantage, compatibility, technophobia, government regulations and competitive pressure) were significant factors in the adoption of cloud computing in academic libraries. In contrast, the moderating variable (perceived trust) was found to be insignificant in all the relationships. Based on this finding, it is recommended that the significant factors should be given serious attention when deciding to adopt cloud computing by academic libraries. The moderating variable should be tested in future studies to ascertain its effect in that context. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Academic libraries; Cloud adoption factors; Cloud computing; Cloud computing adoption; North-Eastern Nigeria","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/SS0/USM/02/4)","Acknowledgment to “ Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme Project with Project Code: FRGS/1/2020/SS0/USM/02/4 ”.

This research studies how technology impacts the health care system to tackle the problem of forming an efficient team for medical purposes at hospitals in the Northern region of Malaysia. In this paper, we explore the Knowledge-based Collaborative Surgical Team (K-CST) system further, which automatically assigns an efficient collaborative surgical team. By utilizing the evolution of technologies and the Internet, this study aims to incorporate a knowledge-based approach with a genetic algorithm to form an efficient medical team. A survey was conducted among 30 health practitioners in the Northern region of Malaysia to predict the acceptance to use of the proposed K-CST system in comparison with the existing system. Collected data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) by using Pearson Correlation to describe the strength of the relationship between K-CST system and the existing system. Results for K- CST system was significant and have a positive relationship, while the results for the existing system were slightly insignificant and had a negative relationship. This study recommends that there should be some improvement in the system with the purpose of promoting a better healthcare system. The results from the analysis showed the hat K-CST system is accepted in the Northern region of Malaysia and has a good potential to be implemented in hospitals in the country. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Collaborative Team; Genetic Algorithm; Knowledge-based system; Technology Acceptance Model","Correlation methods; Genetic algorithms; Hospitals; Surgery; Collaborative teams; Existing systems; Healthcare systems; Knowledge based; Knowledge-based systems; Malaysia; Northern regions; Research studies; Technology acceptance model; Technology impact; Knowledge based systems","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/ICT02/USM/02/4)","Acknowledgement to “Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with Project Code: FRGS/1/2020/ICT02/USM/02/4.

Long-term exposures to lower levels of carbon monoxide have wide implications for human health. Thus, an early warning system for CO atmospheric concentration with an accurate and reliable forecasting method is crucial. Studies for predicting CO atmospheric concentration are still limited in Malaysia especially using data science approaches. This study aims to develop and predict future CO concentration for the next few hours by using the statistical time series approach and machine learning approach. The data used for the project is the air quality data of the monitoring station in Langkawi, Malaysia. The data mining tool used for this project is RapidMiner Studio. Based on the results, it showed that Time Series analysis with deep learning gave a reasonably good CO concentration prediction for the next 3 hours with a relative error of approximate 10%. The model developed in this project can be used by authorities as public health's protection measure to provide an early alarm for alerting the Malaysian populations on the air pollution issue. © 2021.

Since then, researchers in cyber security have come out with numerous reports on threats and attack on organisations. This study is conducted to develop and propose a Cyber Security Defence Policies (CSDP) by harmonising and synthesizing the existing practices identified from the literature review. Observation and questionnaire were adopted to evaluate, review and collect data under ethical agreement from 10 organisations. The validation is based on the principal components for the proposed CSDP and the proposed CSDP, using SPSS as the statistical tool. The result shows that, the validation of the proposed CSDP by 20 experts reveals a standard deviation of 0.607, 0.759, 0.801, 0.754, 0.513, 0.587 and 0.510 on each of the principal components without a missing value respectively. While the correlation matrix and the reproduced correlation matrix for the proposed CSDP indicated 61% and the percentage of acceptance on the principal components for the proposed CSDP are higher than 50%. Therefore, from the outcome, it has shown that the acceptance responds towards the proposed CSDP and the result from the principal components analysis (eigenvalue analysis) are significant enough for implementation and can be adopted by organisations as a guidelines for organisation cyber security practices. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.","Cyber defence policy; Cyber security; Cyber security practices; Organisation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Principal component analysis; Security systems; Statistical mechanics; Correlation matrix; Cybe defense policy; Cybe security practice; Cyber security; Cyber-defense; Defence policy; Principal Components; Security defense; Security Practice; Cybersecurity","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PKOMP/6315392)","We would like to acknowledge and show our appreciation as this paper is supported by the Short Term Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (304/PKOMP/6315392).","Murray E.J., Durcikova A., Integrating IS security with knowledge management: Are we doing enough to thwart the persistent threat?, 2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 3452-3459, (2014); Perlroth N., Scott M., Frenkel S., Cyberattack hits Ukraine then spreads internationally, The New York Times, (2017); Skouloudi C., Fernandez M., Towards secure convergence of cloud and IoT, The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), (2019); Barrett M.P., Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Version 1. 1, (2018); Mittal S., Knowledge for cyber-threat intelligence, (2019); Yeboah-Boateng E.O., Akwa-Bonsu E., Cyber-security intelligence gathering: Issues with knowledge management, Cyber Security and Threats: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications, pp. 1454-1479, (2018); Poppensieker T., Riemenschnitter R., A new posture for cybersecurity in a networked world, Perspectives on transforming cybersecurity, Digital McKinsey and Global Risk Practice, (2019); Min K., Chai C.S., Han M., An international comparative study on cyber security strategy, International Journal of Security and its Applications, 9, 2, pp. 13-20, (2015); Manky D., Threats in the information age, Cyber Security Threats, Challenges and Opportunities, Australian Computer Society, pp. 14-15, (2018); Seemma P.S., Nandhini S., Sowmiya M., Overview of cyber security, International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 7, 11, pp. 125-128, (2018); Mat B., Pero S.D.M., Wahid R., Sule B., Cybersecurity and digital economy in Malaysia: Trusted law for customer and enterprise protection, International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE), 8, 8, pp. 214-220, (2019); Net losses: Estimating the global cost of cybercrime.

Methods: Posts from two Facebook groups whose members consisted of thalassemia patients, thalassemia carriers, and caregivers in Malaysia were ex-tracted using the Data Miner tool. In this study, a new framework known as Malay-English social media text pre-processing was proposed for performing the steps of pre-processing the noisy mixed language (Malay-English language) of social media posts. Topic modeling was used to identify hidden topics within posts shared among members. Three different topic mod-els—latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) in GenSim, LDA in MALLET, and latent semantic analysis—were applied to the data-set with and without stemming using Python. Results: LDA in MALLET without stemming was found to be the best topic model for this dataset. Eight topics were identified within the posts shared by members. Of those eight topics, four were new-ly discovered by this study, and four others corresponded to the findings of previous studies that used an interview approach. Conclusions: Topic 2 (the challenges faced by thalassemia patients) was found to be the topic with the highest attention and engagement. Healthcare practitioners and other concerned parties should make an effort to build a stronger support system related to this issue for those affected by thalassemia. © 2021 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.","Data Mining; Data Science; Natural Language Processing; Social Media; Thalassemia","","","","","","","","Alnaami A, Wazqar D., Disease knowledge and treatment adherence among adult patients with thalassemia: a cross-sectional correlational study, Pielegniarstwo XXI wieku/Nurs 21st Century, 18, 2, pp. 95-101, (2019); Modell B, Darlison M., Global epidemiology of haemo-globin disorders and derived service indicators, Bull World Health Organ, 86, 6, pp. 480-487, (2008); Mohd Ibrahim H., Malaysian thalassaemia registry report 2018, (2019); Wahab IA, Naznin M, Nora MZ, Suzanah AR, Zulaiho M, Faszrul AR, Et al., Thalassaemia: a study on the per-ception of patients and family members, Med J Malaysia, 66, 4, pp. 326-334, (2011); Ismail WI, Hassali MA, Farooqui M, Saleem F, Aljadhey H., Perceptions of thalassemia and its treatment among Malaysian thalassemia patients: a qualitative study, Aus-tralas Med J (Online), 9, 5, pp. 103-110, (2016); Shafie AA, Chhabra IK, Wong JH, Mohammed NS, Ibrahim HM, Alias H., Health-related quality of life among children with transfusion-dependent thalas-semia: a cross-sectional study in Malaysia, Health Qual Life Outcomes, 18, 1, (2020); Mashayekhi F, Jozdani RH, Chamak MN, Mehni S., Caregiver burden and social support in mothers with β-thalassemia children, Glob J Health Sci, 8, 12, pp. 206-212, (2016); Platania S, Gruttadauria S, Citelli G, Giambrone L, Di Nuovo S., Associations of thalassemia major and satisfaction with quality of life: the mediating effect of social support, Health Psychol Open, 4, 2, (2017); Paramore C, Levine L, Bagshaw E, Ouyang C, Kudlac A, Larkin M., Patient-and caregiver-reported burden of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia measured using a digital application, Patient, 14, pp. 197-208, (2021); Rocha HM, Savatt JM, Riggs ER, Wagner JK, Faucett WA, Martin CL., Incorporating social media into your support tool box: points to consider from genetics-based communities, J Genet Couns, 27, 2, pp. 470-480, (2018); Maheri A, Sadeghi R, Shojaeizadeh D, Tol A, Yaseri M, Rohban A., Depression, anxiety, and perceived social support among adults with beta-thalassemia major: cross-sectional study, Korean J Fam Med, 39, 2, pp. 101-107, (2018); Tapi Nzali MD, Bringay S, Lavergne C, Mollevi C, Opitz T., What patients can tell us: topic analysis for social media on breast cancer, JMIR Med Inform, 5, 3, (2017); Curiskis SA, Drake B, Osborn TR, Kennedy PJ., An evaluation of document clustering and topic modelling in two online social networks: Twitter and Reddit, Inf Process Manag, 57, 2, (2020); Tessore JP, Esnaola LM, Russo CC, Baldassarri S., Com-parative analysis of preprocessing tasks over social media texts in Spanish, Proceedings of the XX International Conference on Human Computer Interaction, pp. 1-8, (2019); Omar N, Hamsani AF, Abdullah NA, Abidin SZ., Con-struction of Malay abbreviation corpus based on social media data, J Eng Appl Sci, 12, 3, pp. 468-474, (2017); Husein Z., GitHub Repository, (2018); Kwee AT, Tsai FS, Tang W., Sentence-level novelty detection in English and Malay, Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 40-51; Blei DM, Ng AY, Jordan MI., Latent Dirichlet alloca-tion, J Mach Learn Res, 3, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Landauer TK, Foltz PW, Laham D., An introduction to latent semantic analysis, Discourse Process, 25, 2-3, pp. 259-284, (1998); Pouraboli B, Abedi HA, Abbaszadeh A, Kazemi M., The burden of care: experiences of parents of children with thalassemia, J Nurs Care, 6, 2, (2017); Dadipoor S, Haghighi H, Madani A, Ghanbarnejad A, Shojaei F, Hesam A, Et al., Investigating the mental health and coping strategies of parents with major thal-assemic children in Bandar Abbas, J Educ Health Pro-mot, 4, (2015); Mufti GE, Towell T, Cartwright T., Pakistani children's experiences of growing up with beta-thalassemia major, Qual Health Res, 25, 3, pp. 386-396, (2015); Ishfaq K, Hashmi M, Naeem SB., Mothers’ awareness and experiences of having a thalassemic child: a qualitative approach, Pak J Appl Soc Sci, 2, 1, pp. 35-53, (2015)","A.M.

Factors such as availability and work hours highly influence the decision of forming a collaborative surgical team. This paper studies the factors that influence a surgical collaborative team and introduces additional factors to develop the framework of a knowledge-based system for surgical collaborative team. Social-based factor like trust and leadership are introduced in order to increase the efficiency of a team. Knowledge-based approach is incorporated together with a metaheuristic algorithm to automatically assign medical team and to form an efficient team based on the factors in the framework. The use of ontology is proposed to assist the knowledge management aspect. In order to optimize the team formation, the use of genetic algorithm is proposed. In this paper, the development of the knowledge-based framework for a surgical collaborative team is elaborated by looking into the existing and additional factors. The proposed knowledge management approach using an ontology schema is also discussed. This framework presented in this paper will be used to model a case study to get the feedback from practicing medical personnel especially on the relevance of the factors proposed in order to form the collaborative team. © 2019 IEEE.","collaborative team; genetic algorithm; knowledge management; ontology; team formation optimization","Genetic algorithms; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge management; Ontology; Personnel; Surgery; Collaborative teams; Knowledge based framework; Knowledge-based approach; Medical personnel; Medical teams; Meta heuristic algorithm; Social-based; Team formation; Knowledge based systems","","","","","","","Bridges D.R., Davidson R.A., Odegard P.S., Maki I.V., Tomkowiak J., Interprofessional collaboration: Three best practice models of interprofessional education, Med.

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning can provide an excellent solution to recognize fruits, where the methods are known to be able to classify objects with high accuracy. In this study, several models were proposed and constructed to recognize the Jackfruit and Cempedak using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). We proposed our custom-made own CNN model and modify five transfer learning models on pre-trained VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and InceptionV3.
