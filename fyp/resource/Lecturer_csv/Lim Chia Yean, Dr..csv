Since every company is unique, without the assistance of some methodologies and tools, decision makers encounter great difficulties in conducting predictive analysis, especially in the deliberation and prioritization of new prediction criteria derived from the publicly available unstructured information. This paper proposes a unique methodology which attempts to integrate the personalization and visualization of new prediction criteria. The challenging iterative tasks are achieved through a rule-based inconsistency detection triad-based comparison algorithm, supported by sophisticated visual displays of the relative importance among the prediction criteria. It is hoped that the proposed methodology will intuitively support the decision makers in exploring and deliberating new criteria for making better predictions. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Inconsistency detection; Personalization; Predictive analysis; Unstructured information; Visualization","Decision making; Electronics engineering; Flow visualization; Industry; Visualization; Customer need; Decision makers; Economic downturn; Emerging products; Inconsistency detection; Personalizations; Predictive analysis; Prioritization; Relative importance; Rule based; Technology trends; Unstructured information; Visual display; Forecasting","","","","","","","Shuttleworth M., Prediction in Research: Scientists and Soothsayers, (2009); Davenport T.H., Harris J.G., Competing on analytics: The new science of winning, Boston Massachusetts, (2007); Eckerson W.W., Predictive analytics extending the value of your data warehousing investment, TDWI Best Practices Report First Quarter 2007, (2007); Spangler S.W., Kreulen J.T., Mining the Talk - Unlocking the Business Value in Unstructured Information, (2008); Shmueli G., Koppius O., The challenge of prediction in information systems research, Social Science Research Network Working Paper Series, (2008); Siegel E., Seven Reasons You Need Predictive Analytics Today, (2010); SPSS: 10 Really Good Reasons to Use Predictive Analytics, (2009); SPSS: Increase Customer Value with Predictive Analytics: How Predictive Analytics Benefits Gaming Organizations, (2006); Ramakrishnan R., Madure R., Predictive Analytics: Extending BI Infrastructure, (2008); Liu Y., Agichtein E., You've got answers: Towards personalized models for predicting success in community question answering, Proceedings of the 46th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technologies, (2008); Spohrer J., Service Science An Emerging Multidiscipline to Accelerate the Coevolution of Business-Technology-Work Innovations, (2004); Yadav R., Khoo V.K.T., Lim C.Y., Automatic inconsistency detection for online responses, International Conference on Software and Information Engineering (ICSIE 2011), (2011); Viz.Biz: Introduction to Visualization, (2007); (2007)","C.Y.

This paper describes a novel way to acquire the reasons and contexts behind the prioritization of criteria or alternatives, through a verification mechanism together with a set of logical rules. Essentially, a respondent is expected to visually verify the online responses against the reasons behind the prioritization of each pair of alternatives or criteria. A rule-based approach is then adopted to validate and display the inconsistent responses. Each respondent is expected to correct all detected inconsistency by recording the appropriate reasons and contexts in some concept maps. The resulting verification mechanism could be further enhanced and used as an intelligent organizational knowledge creation and maintenance framework for personalizing a group decision support setting. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Criteria prioritization; Logical inconsistency detection; Verification mechanism","Decision support systems; Concept maps; Group decision supports; Inconsistency detection; Logical rules; Not given; Organizational knowledge; Prioritization; Rule-based approach; Surveys","","","","","","","Siraj S., Preference elicitation from pairwise comparisons in multi-criteria decision making, Thesis Doctor of Philosophy School of Computer Science University of Manchester, (2011); Saaty T., The Analytic Hierarchy Process, (1980); Mateu A.V., A multiple criteria decision making method for heterogeneous data sets, PhD Thesis Department of Computer Science and Mathematics Universitat Politechnica De Catalunya; Lida Y., The number of circular triads in a pairwise comparison matrix and a consistency test in AHP, Journal of the Operations Research Society of Japan, 52, pp. 174-185, (2009); Acovou C.L., Et al., A comparison of pairs, triads and quads in multi-attribute decision making, International Journal of Strategic Decision Sciences (IJSDS), 1, pp. 1-24, (2010); Keri G., On qualitatively consistent, transitive and contradictory judgment matrices emerging from multi attribute decision procedures, Central European Journal of Operations Research, 19, pp. 215-224, (2010); Yadav R., Khoo V.K.T., Lim C.Y., Automatic inconsistency detection for online responses, International Conference On Software and Information Engineering, pp. 657-664, (2011); Nonaka I., Takeuchi H., The Knowledge-Creating Company, (1995); Szczypinska A., Piotrowski E.W., Inconsistency of the judgment matrix in the AHP method and the decision maker's knowledge, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 388, pp. 907-915, (2009); Asahi T., Ikegami T., Fukuzumi S.I., A Usability evaluation method applying AHP and treemap techniques, Human-Computer Interaction New Trends, 5610, pp. 195-203, (2009); Condon E., Golden B., Wasil E., Visualizing group decisions in the analytic hierarchy process, Computers & Operations Research, 30, pp. 1435-1445, (2003); Enez J.M.M.-J., Salvador M., TurOn A., Group preference structures in AHP - group decision making, 2nd Compositional Data Analysis Workshop Girona, (2005); Survey K., 15, (2012); Kandasamy W.B.V., Smarandache F., Fuzzy Cognitive Maps and Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps, (2003); Smarandache F., Neutrosophy, a new branch of philosophy, An International Journal Multiple-Valued Logic, 8, pp. 297-384, (2002); Lim C.Y., Khoo V.K.T., Belaton B., A methodology for deliberating prediction criteria, Applied Mechanics and Materials, 130-134, pp. 1758-1761, (2011)","C.

Observations showed that the inaccuracy of MCDM outcomes might be due to the missing of the right context for decision making process. This research is motivated to propose a contextualization approach for better critical issues' decision making support. The proposed triad-based contextualisation approach comprises three (3) processes namely the context characterisation, context representation, and context interpretation. At the end of a contextualisation process cycle, a set of consistent triad relationships would be derived to represent the current context of a critical issue. The context could be served as the right objective for guiding any critical issue's MCDM process. Experiment showed that the consistency of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) outcome has been improved when the stakeholder used the proposed contextualization approach to depict the the right context as the objective for decision making deliberations. It is believed that once the proposed approach is conducted in many contextualisation process cycles with the help of machine learning systems and advance analytics tools in the future, it could produce a useful set of contexts or objectives for better critical issues' decision making insights. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Context; Critical issue; Decision making support; Inconsistency detection; Triad relationships","","","","","","","","Ahmed F., Profile of Philip N.

The current TB treatment programs are challenging to complete for many patients due to numerous factors, including limited human resources and financial resources. To address these challenges, a solution is needed to aid in resource allocation strategies. This study suggests a machine learning methodology for predicting the treatment outcomes of TB patients. This will enable healthcare facilities to optimize resource allocation based on the prediction made. A large multi-variate TB patient dataset from the Brazilian Information System for Notifiable Disease (SINAN) was used in this study, containing attributes related to patient characteristics, clinical information, and laboratory data. The proposed model used the Naive Bayes algorithm due to its simplicity and efficiency in predicting treatment outcomes. The dataset was pre-processed, and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to overcome the class imbalance issues in the dataset. The combination of the borderline SMOTE and Naive Bayes algorithms on the preprocessed dataset was found to have achieved the highest levels of accuracy among the combinations sampled. This demonstrated the capability of the new algorithm in predicting the treatment outcome of TB patients. The proposed model could assist healthcare providers in implementing more targeted follow-ups and more appropriate resource allocation strategies to improve the overall treatment outcome of TB patients.  © 2023 IEEE.","class-imbalanced; Naive Bayes; SMOTE; treatment outcome prediction; Tuberculosis","Forecasting; Large dataset; Learning systems; Resource allocation; Class-imbalanced; Naive bayes; Naive-Bayes algorithm; Outcome prediction; Resource allocation strategies; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Treatment outcome prediction; Treatment outcomes; Tuberculosis; Tuberculosis patients; Patient treatment","","","","","","","Barberis I., Bragazzi N.L., Galluzzo L., Martini M., The history tuberculosis: From the first historical records to the isolation of Koch's bacillus, Journal of Preventive Medicine and Hygiene, 58, pp. 9-12, (2017); Global tuberculosis report 2022, (2022); The end TB strategy; Aibana O., Et al., Patients' perspectives of tuberculosis treatment challenges and barriers to treatment adherence in Ukraine: A qualitative study, BMJ Open, 10, 1, (2020); Dartois V.A., Rubin E.J., Anti-tuberculosis treatment strategies and drug development: Challenges and priorities, Nature Reviews Microbiology, 20, 11, pp. 685-701, (2022); Fang X.-H., Et al., Prevalence of and factors influencing antituberculosis treatment non-adherence among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: A cross-sectional study in Anhui Province, eastern China, Medical Science Monitor, 25, pp. 1928-1935, (2019); Kilale A.M., Et al., Economic burden of tuberculosis in Tanzania: A national survey of costs faced by tuberculosis-affected households, BMC Public Health, 22, 1, (2022); Padayatchi N., Daftary A., Naidu N., Naidoo K., Pai M., Tuberculosis: Treatment failure, or failure to treat?

This research is motivated to assist the stakeholders to better understand a critical issue by looking into the contextualisation aspects. The proposed contextualisation approach comprises three processes namely the context characterisation, context representation, and context interpretation. At the end of a contextualisation process cycle, a set of consistent triad relationships would be derived to represent the current context of a critical issue. From an experiment that has been conducted with a stakeholder, this proposed approach has proven to be able to help the stakeholders to determine the right context to understand a critical issue. Besides, a case study has also been conducted to prove the ease of use, ease of usefulness, and stakeholder's intention to use of the proposed approach. It is believed that once the proposed approach is conducted in many contextualisation process cycles with the help of machine learning systems and advance analytics tools, it could produce a useful set of contexts for any critical issue in making better decision deliberations and insights. © 2016 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.","Context; Critical issue; Inconsistency detection; Triad relationships","Artificial intelligence; Context; Context representation; Contextualisation; Critical issues; Government investment; Inconsistency detection; Standing problems; Triad relationships; Learning systems","","","","","","","Zakaria N.H., Haron A., Sahibuddin S., Harun M., Requirement engineering critical issues in public sector software project success factor, International Journal of Information and Electronics Engineering, 1, pp. 200-209, (2011); Lim C.Y., Khoo V.K.T., A triad-based inconsistency detection mechanism for eliciting tacit knowledge, The Third International Conference on Digital Information and Communication Technology and its Applications (DICTAP2013), pp. 68-73, (2013); Falque E., Five Critical Issues No Business Can Afford to Miss - Trust and Other Key Themes in 2012, (2012); Sharfstein J., Fontanarosa P.B., Bauchner H., Critical issues in US health care: Health care on the edge, JAMA, 310, pp. 1945-1946, (2013); TRB : Critical Issues in Transportation 2013, (2013); Pathways : What is a Critical Issue?, (2014); DeWitt P., 10 Critical Issues Facing Education, (2014); Larrucea X., Combelles A., Favaro J., Safety-Critical Software, 30, pp. 25-27, (2013); Ali R., Modeling and Reasoning about Contextual Requirements: Goal-based Framework, (2010); Cicconi P., Tools and Methods Based on Knowledge Elicitation to Support Engineering Design, (2010); Dzung D.V., Ohnishi A., Improvement of quality of software requirements with requirements ontology, 9th International Conference on Quality Software QSIC '09, pp. 284-289, (2009); Dutoit A., McCall R., Mistrik I., Paech B., Rationale management in software engineering: Concepts and techniques, Rationale Management in Software Engineering, pp. 1-48, (2006); Ivanenko V., Mikhalevich V., On uncertainty problems in decision- making, Cybernetics and Systems Analysis, 44, pp. 247-249, (2008); Dey A.K., Understanding and using context, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 5, pp. 4-7, (2001); O'Callaghan P.H.D., Context and Decision: Three Approaches to Representing Preferences, (2011); Rudy J.W., Context representations, context functions, and the parahippocampal-hippocampal system, Learning & Memory, 16, pp. 573-585, (2009); Rosemann M., Recker J.C., Flender C., Contextualisation of business processes, International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management, Vol.3, pp. 47-60, (2008); Eckerson W.W., Predictive analytics extending the value of your data warehousing investment, TDWI 2007 Q1 Best Practices Report, (2007); Zisko A., Knowledge-Based Model for Integrated Tall Building Design Factors, (2008); Gross D., Software Architecture Decision-Making in Organizational Settings, (2011); Winbladh K., Precise and Usable Requirements through an Interactive Model-based Approach, (2010); Wang H.H., A Context-Based Representation and Reasoning Formalism to Support Construction Safety Planning, (2010); Perttunen M., Riekki J., Lassila O., Context representation and reasoning in pervasive computing: A review, International Journal of Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering, 4, pp. 1-28, (2009); Serafini L., Homola M., Contextual representation and reasoning with description logics, Description Logics, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 745, (2011); Gomez-Romero J., Bobillo F., Delgado M., Context representation and reasoning with formal ontologies, Activity Context Representation, 11, (2011); Padovitz A., Loke S.W., Zaslavsky A., The ECORA framework: A hybrid architecture for contextoriented pervasive computing, Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 4, pp. 182-215, (2008); Riva O., Contory: A middleware for the provisioning of context information on smart phones, Middleware, pp. 219-239, (2006); Ahmed F., Profile of Philip N.

It is often used among the medium to large organizations for predicting future revenues from their customers. Many research projects have been conducted to enhance the individual prediction models and formulae. However, there are no obvious formal approaches to ensure the consistency and customizability of a prediction process and its major elements. This paper proposes a basic set of computer-assisted tools for a CLV prediction process. The semi-automated tools could be used by the business analysts of an organization to customize the existing templates; record, monitor, and track the work done in each phase of the process. In this paper, various challenges are discussed together with their possible solutions. The tools are specifically designed and implemented for the derivation of customizable formulae and models among the different customer segments of a non-profit organization. In the near future, more research work would be conducted to enhance the capabilities of the tools to cater for possible collaborative CLV predictions among the interested parties on the variables, algorithms, and the subsystems of a model base management system and the associated knowledge base management system. © 2010 IEEE.","Customer lifetime value;

As more and more Malaysian business merchants jumped onto the bandwagon, most of them only managed to setup basic websites, with basic databases to store transactional and customer data. However, when the merchants needed to further analyze customer purchasing patterns or any other aspects of demographic behavior, they found that it could not be done due to missing or incomplete data. Therefore, the objective of this research was to explore the current readiness of the merchants' data collection policies in taking advantage of business analytics. A study was conducted to review the data privacy policies of 32 E-commerce merchants to understand the types of data collected by the merchants. Furthermore, mapping was done to check on whether the collected data is sufficient enough to apply in specific analytical models to review the churn rate, conversion rate and customer lifetime value of the E-commerce customers. The study showed that most merchants had only collected enough information to conduct basic business analytics. As a result, this exploratory study managed to devise a data analytic model, with the relevant data types, that can be used by E-commerce merchants to collect and leverage data to conduct more in-depth analytics to better understand their customers. © 2021 IEEE.","business key performance indicator; data analytics; E-commerce merchants","Analytical models; Data acquisition; Data Analytics; Data privacy; Electronic commerce; Sales; Analytic modeling; Business analytics; Business key performance indicator; Data analytics; E-commerce business; E-commerce merchant; Key performance indicators; Malaysia; Malaysians; Small-and-medium enterprise; Benchmarking","","","","","","","Shahzad A., Hassan R., Abdullah N.I., Hussain A., Fareed M., Covid-19 impact on e-commerce usage: An empirical evidence from malaysian healthcare industry, Humanities & Social Sciences Reviews, 8, 3, pp. 599-609, (2020); Vishnoi L., 10 Problems That Every Ecommerce Business Faces and Their Solutions, (2020); Malaysian Communications Multimedia Commission Internet User Survey Report 2017, (2017); Ismail N.A., Masud M.M., Prospects and Challenges in Improving E-commerce Connectivity in Malaysia, pp. 78-98, (2020); WebFX 18 Key Performance Indicators for Ecommerce Websites; Estrella-Ramon A., Sanchez-Perez M., Swinnen G., Vanhoof K., A marketing view of the customer value: Customer lifetime value and customer equity, South African Journal of Business Management, 44, 4, pp. 47-64, (2013); Bernazzani S., What Is Churn Rate, (2019); Campbell P., Calculate Churn Rate, (2020); Lavskaya V., The Three-level Analytics Approach for Ecommerce: Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive, (2019); Friedenthal S., Moore A., Steiner R., Chapter 18-Integrating SysML into a systems development environment, A Practical Guide to SysML (Third Edition, pp. 507-541, (2015); Sisense Descriptive Analytics; Narang B., Verma P., Kochar P., Application based, advantageous K-means clustering algorithm in data mining-A review, International Journal of Latest Trends in Engineering and Technology (IJLTET, 7, 2, pp. 121-126, (2016); IBM What Is Logistic Regression?; Pinkasovitch A., Using Decision Trees in Finance; Karas M., Reznakova M., Predicting the bankruptcy of construction companies: A CART-based model, Engineering Economics, 28, 2, pp. 145-154, (2017); Khandelwal N., Analysis of customer churn prediction in telecom sector using CART algorithm, International Journal of Innovative Research in Computer Science Engineering and Information Technology, 1, 1, pp. 1-6, (2019); Popescu M.E., Andreica M., Popescu I.P., Decision support solution to business failure prediction, Proceedings of the International Management Conference, 11, 1, pp. 99-106, (2017); Durica M., Frnda J., Svabova L., Decision tree based model of business failure prediction for Polish companies, Oeconomia Copernicana, 10, 3, pp. 453-469, (2019); Monjezi N., The application of the CART and CHIAD algorithms in sugar beet yield prediction, Basrah J.
