However, with the increase in real-time traffic requirements in wireless sensor nodes, network performance metrics are increasingly important. Nonetheless, most existing network performance studies were done via simulation, with few experimental studies performed on testbeds using ad hoc methodologies. This paper proposes a structured experimental methodology for evaluating the delay, throughput, and packet loss performance of wireless sensor networks, while addressing practical issues related to the use of an experimental approach. A global clock synchronization technique, in addition to insertion of timestamps in the network packets was proposed for more accurate measurement of the network delay. Several different physical topologies such as single cluster, chain, and cluster tree topologies were defined as standard test topologies. The EMLMAC protocol was used to demonstrate the viability of the proposed structured experimental methodology. Based on the proposed experimental approach, the measured throughput for EMLMAC for the single cluster two-hop and three-hop chain topologies differed by 1.02%, 6.75% and 13.91% respectively from the simulation results. This indicates that an experimental approach is essential for verifying the actual performance of a wireless sensor network. © 2013 IEEE.","delay; experimental methodology; packet loss; throughput; time synchronization; wireless sensor network","Advanced traffic management systems; Chains; Energy utilization; Medium access control; Network performance; Packet loss; Throughput; Topology; Wireless sensor networks; delay; Experimental approaches; Experimental methodology; Global clock synchronizations; Medium access control protocols; Network performance metrics; Packet loss performance; Time synchronization; Sensor nodes","","","","","","","Grilo A., Macedo M., Nunes M., An energy-efficient low-latency multi-sink mac protocol for alarm-driven wireless sensor networks, Proc. 3rd Int.

To achieve this, nodes need to be synchronized and know about each other's notion of time. However, distributed time synchronization protocols rely on frequent message exchanges which often incur high overheads. The proposed distributed and efficient slot assignment-alignment (DESAA) protocol is a decentralized MAC protocol incorporating algorithms which minimize collisions incurred during slot requests and assignments, detect hidden terminals, and eliminate message overheads of global time synchronization by implementing time slot synchronization and continuous time slot realignment. DESAA leverages preassigned IP addresses of nodes for channel access arbitration and time slot assignment during its setup phase. Furthermore, the time slot alignment process maintains the time slot synchronization throughout the multihop network hierarchy during the data phase. The analysis showed a significant reduction in medium access contention, while the final testbed and simulation results for DESAA confirm a very fast total convergence time of 3.62 s per hop for both slot assignment and slot synchronization. Packet loss was minimized in comparison with the carrier sense multiple access protocol used by existing time synchronization and slot assignment algorithms. An average time slot synchronization error of 0 +/- 30.51 μs for a 4-node line topology with three hops, and 0 $+/- 67.81 μs for a 25-node grid topology with eight hops was achieved, outperforming most time synchronization approaches in terms of convergence time and message overhead while maintaining comparable or better accuracy.  © 2014 IEEE.","Internet of Things (IoT); medium access control (MAC); time slot assignment; time slot synchronization; time synchronization; wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Alignment; Continuous time systems; Distributed computer systems; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Medium access control; Peer to peer networks; Sensor nodes; Time division multiple access; Topology; Convergence; Internet of thing; Medium access control; Peer-to-peer computing; Slot synchronization; Time slot assignment; Time slot synchronization; Time synchronization; Time-division multiple access; Timeslots; Wireless sensor network; Synchronization","","","","","","","Wang Q., Jiang J., Comparative examination on architecture and protocol of industrial wireless sensor network standards, IEEE Commun.

A large number of proposed protocols in the literature employ a message passing mechanism to make sensor node clocks tick in unison. In this paper, we first classify Message Passing based Time Synchronization (MPTS) protocols and then analyze them based on different metrics. The classification is based on the following three criteria: structure formation of the network affected by the synchronization protocol, frequency of synchronization process (synchronization interval), and synchronization message overhead. Proposed protocols are analyzed and evaluated from different perspectives based on available data. A comparison table of the reviewed protocols is presented according to the evaluation metrics. Finally, some potential methods will be proposed to improve the synchronization process. © 2016 Mohammad Ali Sarvghadi and Tat-Chee Wan.","","Internet protocols; Sensor nodes; Synchronization; Evaluation metrics;
