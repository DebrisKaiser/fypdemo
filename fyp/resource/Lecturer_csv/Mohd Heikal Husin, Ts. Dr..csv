However, studies have revealed that despite the important roles of cloud computing, most libraries in higher educational institutions in some West African Countries have not adopted the technology. Additionally, existing empirical studies on the adoption of cloud computing in English-speaking countries of West African academic libraries are low and vary from one country to another as well as from one geo-political region to the other. This necessitates the need to explore the existing empirical studies which were carried out on the adoption of cloud computing level and its impact in academic libraries in West Africa such as Ghana, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Several online academic databases were used as sources of data for this study using relevant keywords. As such, this study reviewed the existing empirical research on cloud computing acceptance within West Africa which revealed varying results concerning cloud computing acceptance in academic libraries. results revealed that the majority of the existing studies of cloud computing in academic libraries were found to be focused in Nigeria, and the findings further revealed that the Southern and Eastern parts of Nigeria have more studies compared to the other parts. Based on this outcome, this study recommends additional empirical study to be conducted on cloud computing adoption among the Anglophone Countries of West African academic libraries, as the factors for technology adoption may likely differ from one area to the other. © 2023 SPIE.","academic libraries; Anglophone countries; Cloud computing adoption; factors for cloud technology adoption; Nigerian academic libraries; West African countries","Libraries; Academic libraries; Anglophone country; Cloud computing adoption; Cloud technologies; Cloud-computing; Factor for cloud technology adoption; Nigerian academic library; Nigerians; Technology adoption; West african country; Cloud computing","","","","","","","Ahmad S.

As such, air travellers often face some form of issues before or after their flights. Those issues include not having the printed boarding pass on hand when they reach the airport, facing difficulties to look for flight information displays at the airport, waiting in long queues before using the airport transports and do not know the latest situation at the airport before going there. These issues may bring some negative consequences to the air travellers. Hence, an Android based mobile application called 'Smart Flyers' has been developed to help air travellers to overcome the issues stated above. In this mobile application, there are four main functionalities, which are flight boarding pass functionality, flight information functionality, airport transport booking functionality and the social aspect functionality. For this mobile application, the programming language used are Android Java Programming Language, Hypertext Pre-processor (PHP) and Structured Query Language (SQL) whereas the development software used are Android Studio and Notepad++. In short, the goal of Smart Flyers mobile application is to bring convenience to the air travellers by helping them to mitigate the issues that they face before or after their flight. © 2017 IEEE.","air travellers; airport transport; boarding pass; flight information; flyers zone; information news and updates; smart flyers mobile application","Air transportation; Airports; Android (operating system); Computer programming languages; Hypertext systems; Mobile computing; Query languages; Social aspects; Air travellers; Boarding pass; Flight information; information news and updates; Mobile applications; Application programs","","","","","","","Air Transport, Passengers Carried; Magrath A., A Third of Passengers Have Switched to Digital Airport Check in As Half Are Stung Up by Up to £70 Fees for Lost Boarding Pass, (2014); Goh T., Airport Cab Queues Long but Manageable, (2015); Can i Reprint My Boarding Pass?; Charlton G., Missed Flight Due to Queues at Check in, (2013); Mills K.A., Ridiculously Long Queues at Airport Security Are Causing Travellers to Miss Their Flights, (2016)","","Riza L.S.; Pranolo A.; Wibawa A.P.; Junaeti E.; Wihardi Y.; Hashim U.R.; Horng S.-J.; Drezewski R.; Lim H.S.; Chakraborty G.; Hernandez L.; Nazir S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd International Conference on Science in Information Technology, ICSITech 2017","25 October 2017 through 26 October 2017","Bandung","134245","","978-150905866-2","","","English","Proc. - Int.

As no company can escape the effects of the pandemic, mature Big Data and analytics practices are essential for successful decision-making insights and keeping pace with a changing and unpredictable marketplace. The ability to be successful in Big Data projects is related to the organization’s maturity level. The maturity model is a tool that could be applied to assess the maturity level across specific key dimensions, where the maturity levels indicate an organization’s current capabilities and the desirable state. Big Data maturity models (BDMMs) are a new trend with limited publications published as white papers and web materials by practitioners. While most of the related literature might not have covered all of the existing BDMMs, this systematic literature review (SLR) aims to contribute to the body of knowledge and address the limitations in the existing literature about the existing BDMMs, assessment dimensions, and tools. The SLR strategy in this paper was conducted based on guidelines to perform SLR in software engineering by answering three research questions: (1) What are the existing maturity assessment models for Big Data? (2) What are the assessment dimensions for Big Data maturity models? and (3) What are the assessment tools for Big Data maturity models? This SLR covers the available BDMMs written in English and developed by academics and practitioners (2007–2022). By applying a descriptive qualitative content analysis method for the reviewed publications, this SLR identified 15 BDMMs (10 BDMMs by practitioners and 5 BDMMs by academics). Additionally, this paper presents the limitations of existing BDMMs. The findings of this paper could be used as a grounded reference for assessing the maturity of Big Data. Moreover, this paper will provide managers with critical insights to select the BDMM that fits within their organization to support their data-driven decisions. Future work will investigate the Big Data maturity assessment dimensions towards developing a new Big Data maturity model. © 2022 by the authors.","big data; big data analytics; big data maturity model; capability maturity model (CMM); COVID-19 pandemic; critical success factors; maturity model; readiness assessment; systematic literature review","Big data; Data Analytics; Decision making; Software engineering; Big data analytic; Big data maturity model; Capability maturity model; Capability maturity models; COVID-19 pandemic; Critical success factor; Data analytics; Data maturity; Maturity model; Readiness assessment; Success factors; Systematic literature review; COVID-19","","","","","","","Rapaccini M., Saccani N., Kowalkowski C., Paiola M., Adrodegari F., Navigating disruptive crises through service-led growth: The impact of COVID-19 on Italian manufacturing firms, Ind.

However, even with the simplicity and security that the technology provide, the adoption of this technology is not widespread. In this paper, we describe the user-friendliness criteria essential for NFC technology through a proposed library system. To determine the criteria of user-friendliness for the technology, we conducted a survey on the understanding and usage of different users that would be exposed to a library system. The survey included questions about the existing library system (OPAC) and their perception of the NFC technology. Based on the results, we managed to identify that the OPAC system is not a userfriendly library system. Further, we have also identified that there are three main user-friendliness criteria deemed necessary by users for an NFC-enabled library system to be more effective than the OPAC system: usability, security and efficiency. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Near-field communication; OPAC system; Radio frequency identification (RFID)","","","","","","","","Steffen R., Preibinger J., Schollermann T., Muller A., Schnabel I., Near Field Communication (NFC) in an Automotive Environment: Use Cases, Architecture and Realization.

Polices are developed and applied to specific areas or applications within the organisation; such that they are sited within an organisational context. Evidence suggests that the development of policies for general employment conditions, (for example, electronic mail usage), tends to be highly structured and provide little flexibility for their implementation. Standard organisational policy development is about applying a set of rules in the workplace. However, when implementing social media in an organisation, the standard policy development processes are not effective in allowing organisations to benefit from the available social media tools. Social media tools have the advantages of offering the organisation flexibility and rapid dispersion of information within the online environment. Hence, organisational policy development for social media usage needs to take these characteristics into account. There is a perceived gap concerning the development of policies for social media usage, as traditional organisational policy development enforces structure and rules that are at odds with the ways social media tools work in the organisation. To fill this gap, we have proposed the Social Media and Organisation Policy (SOMEOP) framework, created to allow organisations to build policies that take specific social media advantages or issues into consideration. By combining key components, such as legal issues, and social media ethics, this framework demonstrates effective and efficient development of social media policy. This paper highlights the processes involved for a public sector entity when developing a social media policy using the SOMEOP framework, and describes the application of the framework within the entity.","Enterprise 2.0; Guidelines; Organisations; Policies; Social media; SOMEOP","Information systems; Public policy; Business operation; Employment conditions; Guidelines; Legal issues; Online environments; Organisations; Policy development; Policy development process; Public sector; Set of rules; Social media; SOMEOP; Specific areas; Societies and institutions","","","","","","","Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research Viewed, (2010); Althaus C., Bridgman P., Davis G., The Australian Policy Handbook, 4, (2008); Althaus C., Bridgman P., Davis G., The Australian Policy Handbook, 4, (2000); Armbrust M., Fox A., Griffith R., Joseph A.D., Katz R., Konwinski A., Lee G., Patterson D., Rabkin A., Stoica I., Zaharia M., A view of cloud computing, Commun.

Perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, opinions, and ideas of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) campus community members are explored in focus group discussions (FGD) to determine the main factors influencing their zero-waste pro-environmental behaviour (PEB). The in-depth interview (IDI) is used to learn more about the university campus community’s perspectives on the themes defined by the FGD. The instruments were developed based on the adaption and adoption of previous studies, especially in reference to Kollmuss and Agyeman’s 2002 Model of Pro-Environmental Behaviour and a modified Knowledge-Attitude-Practices model. The findings show that environmental goals, environmental education, personal waste-related experience, environmental policy, environmental self-awareness, reinforcement contingencies, community engagement, social responsibilities, exemplary leadership, and social media influence the campus community’s zero-waste PEB. A framework based on an adaptation of Kollmuss and Agyeman’s model of pro-environmental behaviour is proposed to promote sustainable pro-environmental behaviour towards a Zero-Waste Campus. © 2023 by the authors.","persuasive technology; pro-environmental behaviour; social media; waste minimisation; zero-waste campus","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (LRGS MRUN/F2/01/2019/2/2)","This work was supported by Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Long Term Research Project (Project Code: LRGS MRUN/F2/01/2019/2/2).","Kaza S., Yao L., Bhada-Tata P., van Woerden F., What a Waste 2.0: A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050, What a Waste 2.0: A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050, (2018); Yang H., Ma M., Thompson J.R., Flower R.J., Waste management, informal recycling, environmental pollution and public health, J.

The existing OPAC platform acts as a search engine for reading materials in the library is commonly complicated and not user friendly. The Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is introduced in this project as part of a mobile application. NFC is a set of protocols on portable devices which perform wireless and contact-less short range, two-way communication between compatible devices. Transmission of data between devices is completed over radio waves and magnetic induction with passive NFC devices. As mobile devices, especially smartphones are more commonly utilized by users all around the world including university students, the proposed system would be able to enhance the performance of a library to be more convenient, secure, and more user friendly. Indirectly, the development of this mobile application can improve the visitation rates of students to the library by simplifying the searching, tracking reading materials and borrowing activities. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2018.","Android-based application; Library system; Mobile application; NFC technology; Smart university","Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Radio transmission; Search engines; Wireless telecommunication systems; Library systems; Mobile applications; Nfc technologies; Smart universities; The near field communication (NFC); Transmission of data; Two way communications; University students; Near field communication","","","","","","","Villen-Rueda L., Senso J.A., De Moya-Anegon F., The use of OPAC in a large academic library: A transactional log analysis study of subject searching, J Acad Librarianship, 33, 3, pp. 327-337, (2007); Arshad A., Shafique F., What do users prefer, card catalogue or OPAC?, A Study of Punjab University Library.

However, scholars have argued that, in spite of the technological preparations countries can take to shield themselves from attack, human factors may be the key reason behind increasing breaches in cybersafety in recent years. In this review, developed in a social sciences context, we argue that intra- and interpersonal human factors, such as biological, psychological, and cultural factors, must be considered holistically to effectively increase awareness of the importance of online safety. We also argue that these personal and psychological factors can be framed using Urie Bronfenbrenner's theory of human ecology, which, along with previous studies, points to the importance of examining the various layers of environmental factors that affect human behavior. Lastly, this paper also considers what types of education and training can effectively utilize the knowledge of human factors to increase online safety awareness. © 2021","Awareness; Ecological systems theory; Education; Malaysia; Online safety","Malaysia; Behavioral research; Cybersecurity; E-learning; Ecology; Graphene; Online systems; Awareness; Ecological system theory; Ecological systems; Human ecology; Large-scales; Malaysia; Online safety; Psychological factors; Safety awareness; Small scale; holistic approach; psychology; safety; Human engineering","","","","","","","Hamsi A.S., Cybercrime over internet love scams in Malaysia: a discussion on the theoretical perspectives, connecting factors and keys to the problem, J.

By introducing a 24-h self-service via Public Self-Service Machines, several issues can be alleviated, such as the congestion in the traditional service environment, to support specific services outside of the traditional office hours, and to allow citizens to feel that the government is committed to providing convenience and mindful public services. However, few existing studies have examined sustainability as a fundamental attribute of these Public Self-Service Machines. This lack of focus would result in Public Self-Service Machines not being sustainable in the long run. Therefore, further research on how to design and measure sustainable development attributes for Public Self-Service Machines is necessary to address this issue effectively. In this paper, the sustainable development attributes of Public Self-Service Machines based on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are firstly presented. Then, a questionnaire survey was conducted to collect and analyze the views of industry experts to propose 13 metrics to measure the sustainable development attributes of Public Self-Service Machines. © 2022 by the authors.","24-h self-service; public self-service machines; sustainable development attributes; sustainable development goals (SDGs)","government; machinery; questionnaire survey; Sustainable Development Goal","","","","","","","Keeble B.R., The Brundtland Report: ’Our Common Future’, Med.

Big Data comes to life with insights to improve the technology fashion and lifestyle with calling for readiness to change. Big Data has become a significant factor that could be a material asset for both business and government organizations. As such, it is important to understand the definition of Big Data, their key characteristics, and the challenges surrounding the concept and characteristics. The implementation of Big Data brings new critical challenges that need to be addressed before starting the Big Data journey. The main challenges that are commonly faced by organizations are the implementation of Big Data alongside the critical challenges that involve the challenges related to technology, organization, process, data management, and skills. The challenges are difficult and the growth in terms of Big Data is increasing exponentially which calls for further investigation. This paper reviewed the existing literature on Big Data to achieve three objectives: first, to highlight the definitions and characteristics of Big Data and to summarize the most common definitions of existing works; second, to identify the impacts and the opportunities for the Big Data; third, to present and identify the main critical challenges related to Big Data and categorize these challenges as (People, Technology, Organization, Process, and Data management) challenges. © 2019 IEEE.","Big Data; Big Data Analytics; Big Data Challenges; Big Data Characteristics; Critical Success Factors; Data Management","Data Analytics; Information management; Business partners; Critical challenges; Critical success factor; Data challenges; Data characteristics; Data impact; Government organizations; Key characteristics; Big data","","","","","","","Manyika J., Et al., Big data: The next frontier for innovation , competition , and productivity, McKinsey Glob.

This research seeks to give an extended model investigating the intention to use MOOCs based on students at public universities in northwestern Nigeria. The extended TAM model was tested via PLS structural equation modelling using data collected from 451 students at public universities in northwestern Nigeria. The research findings indicated that the proposed extended model delivers a 72.0% descriptive effect. The creative technology acceptance TAM model establishes a strong signal for the effects of PU, PR, PEOU, SN, and TA on intentions to practice MOOCs technology among students in Nigerian public universities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The outcomes present practical and theoretical implications that MOOC developers can use to justify why MOOCs are not high within public universities in Northern-western Nigeria. The findings also indicated that PU, PEOU, PR SN, and TA significantly impact students' intention to use MOOCs. The research has provided insight into extended TAM in Nigerian learning environments to discover the issues influencing students' intention to use MOOCs. Dissimilar to preceding empirical reviews, this research broadly investigated the intention to participate in MOOCs of public University students in northwestern Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic, delivering crucial discoveries and commendations for impending research openings.

The ability to be successful in Big Data is related to the maturity level of the organization. A Maturity Model (MM) is a tool that can be applied to assess the 'As-is' situation regarding specific key dimensions, where the maturity levels indicate an organization's current capabilities and the desirable state. Most of the available literature on the Maturity Models for Big Data is still in white papers, reports, and internet materials from developers' websites. The existing literature might not have covered all the available Maturity Models for Big Data. This paper reviewed the existing literature to achieve three objectives: first, to provide a comprehensive overview about the Maturity, Maturity Model, Capability Maturity Model, and the Maturity Model for Big Data; second, to identify the existing Big Data Maturity Models and to summarize the most used models; third, to highlight the limitations of the existing Big Data Maturity Models. © 2019 IEEE.","Big Data; Big Data Maturity Model; Capability Maturity Model; Capability Maturity Model Integration; Maturity; Maturity Model","Economics; Software engineering; Capability maturity model integration; Capability maturity models; Data maturity; Maturity; Maturity model; Big data","","","","","","","Chen M., Mao S., Liu Y., Big data: A survey, Mob.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to close a research gap by verifying the protection motivation theory using gender as a moderator. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a purposive sampling approach to collect data from Dhaka city, in which 370 valid responses were selected. Additionally, the quantitative and cross-sectional survey used a seven-point Likert scale. Afterward, the evaluation approach included three phases: a measurement model, a structural model and multi-group analysis. Findings: Vulnerability, self-efficacy and response-efficacy were discovered to be critical predictors with a variance of 60.4%. Moreover, there was a significant disparity between males and females in two relationships, response efficacy and intention as well as response cost and intention. Practical implications: This research expands our understanding of Generation Z consumers' behavioral intentions to take measures against household threats, allowing preventative programs to be improved. Further, in the case of applying coping strategies, a practical difference between males and females has been found that must be bridged through awareness campaigns. Originality/value: This study has made a unique contribution to the information system literature. First, the role of protection motivation theory factors in addressing security concerns in homes has been assessed. Second, the coping evaluation process has a greater impact on users' intentions than the threat appraisal process. However, males and females use slightly different approaches to defending themselves against the threat. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Burglary; Gender; Generation Z; Internet of things; Protection motivation theory","Moderators;

The key issue in testing is determining the sufficiency of tests and, traditionally this has been done by using the Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs). However, SRGMs are not applicable when there are no stabilization phases as required by most software reliability models. Test-Defect Coverage Analytics Model (TDCAM) has been proposed to address this problem. This paper proposes the application of visual analytic techniques as an approach for supporting informed decision making in deciding the sufficiency of tests. Visual analytics research considers interactive visualization as the common platform for combining various computational data analysis techniques to support the analytical reasoning process. We presented four visual representations of TDCAM to demonstrate how analytical models have been applied to indicate the adequacy of tests in relation to sufficient and efficient test coverage. The techniques provide an effective and generally applicable test estimation on the basis of a general trend that higher test coverage correlates with higher probability of detecting more defects. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Software reliability; Software testing; Software visualization; Test analytics; Visual analytics","Application programs; Data visualization; Decision making; Software reliability; Testing; Visualization; Analytic technique; Analytical reasoning; Interactive visualizations; Software reliability growth models; Software reliability models; Software visualization; Visual analytics; Visual representations; Software testing","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (304.PKOMP.6316282)","The authors would like to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia Bridging Research Grant Scheme (304.PKOMP.6316282) for the financial support.

The mediating effect of Facebook adoption between the determinants of Facebook adoption and the performance of the SMEs was examined. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive framework was built using the technology – organisation–environment framework integrated with the resource-based view theory. Data were collected from 165 SME decision-makers using an online survey. The hypothesised relationships were tested using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Findings: Facebook adoption exerted a positive impact on the financial and non-financial performance of the SMEs. The important determinants of Facebook adoption were relative advantage, perceived risks, top management support, organisational readiness and government support. The mediating effect of Facebook adoption between these determinants and financial and non-financial performance was confirmed. Research limitations/implications: The findings contribute to better insight into the determinants of Facebook adoption and its impact on the financial and non-financial performance of SMEs. The findings can inspire and guide SMEs on adopting Facebook as a marketing strategy to improve performance and reduce failure rates. Originality/value: The findings confirm the potential of adopting Facebook for enhancing the performance of SMEs. This is arguably among the first empirical studies to test the mediating effect of Facebook adoption. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Determinants; Developing countries; Facebook adoption; Performance; Service-based SMEs; Services SMEs","Decision making; Failure analysis; Finance; Least squares approximations; Marketing; Social networking (online); Determinant; Facebook; Facebook adoption; Mediating effect; Performance; Service small and medium enterprise; Service-based; Service-based small and medium enterprise; Small-and-medium enterprise; Developing countries","","","","","","","Abdullahi M.S., Jakada B.A., Kabir S., Challenges affecting the performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria, Journal of Human Capital Development (JHCD), 9, 2, pp. 21-46, (2016); Abedin B., Adoption of Facebook for customer relationship management for SMEs: exploring the underlying motivations, Strategic Customer Relationship Management in the Age of Social Media, pp. 60-71, (2015); Abubakar M.K., Patricia M.N., Samuel O.O., Totolo A., Factors affecting adoption of social media by women’s non-governmental organisations (WNGOs), International Journal of Library and Information Science, 9, 9, pp. 96-106, (2017); Adegbuyi O.A., Akinyele F., Akinyele S., Effect of social media marketing on small scale business performance in ota-metropolis, Nigeria, International Journal of Social Sciences and Management, 2, 3, pp. 275-283, (2015); Afolabi A., Ojelabi R.A., Oyeyipo O., An analysis of social media marketing of indigenous construction firms in Nigeria: a tool for sustainable growth, International Journal of Construction Supply Chain Management, 8, 2, pp. 60-72, (2018); Agwu E., An investigative analysis of factors influencing ebusiness adoption and maintenance of commercial websites in Nigeria, (2018); Ahani A., Rahim N.Z.A., Nilashi M., Forecasting social CRM adoption in SMEs: a combined SEM-neural network method, Computers in Human Behavior, 75, pp. 560-578, (2017); Ainin S., Parveen F., Moghavvemi S., Jaafar N.I., Mohd Shuib N.L., Factors influencing the use of social media by SMEs and its performance outcomes, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 115, 3, pp. 570-588, (2015); Akuz M., Isaac O.M., Abdullahi A.I., Effect of electronic marketing on the performance of SMEs in Karu local government area, Nasarawa state of Nigeria, FUO Quarterly Journal of Contemporary Research, 8, 2, (2020); Alalwan A.A., Rana N.P., Dwivedi Y.K., Algharabat R., Social media in marketing: a review and analysis of the existing literature, Telematics and Informatics, 34, 7, pp. 1177-1190, (2017); Ali Qalati S., Li W., Ahmed N., Ali Mirani M., Khan A., Examining the factors affecting SME performance: the mediating role of social media adoption, Sustainability, 13, 1, (2021); Alsaad A., Mohamad R., Ismail N.A., The moderating role of trust in business to business electronic commerce (B2B EC) adoption, Computers in Human Behavior, 68, pp. 157-169, (2017); Alshamaila Y., Social network site usage by small- and medium-sized businesses: understanding the motivations and barriers, Modern Applied Science, 12, 3, (2018); Apulu I., Latham A., Moreton R., Factors affecting the effective utilisation and adoption of sophisticated ICT solutions: case studies of SMEs in Lagos, Nigeria, Journal of Systems and Information Technology, 13, 2, pp. 125-143, (2011); Awa H.O., Ukoha O., Emecheta B.C., Liu S., Using T-O-E theoretical framework to study the adoption of ERP solution, Cogent Business and Management, 3, 1, (2016); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Burton-Jones A., Gallivan M.J., Toward a deeper understanding of system usage in organizations: a multilevel perspective, MIS Quarterly, 31, 4, pp. 657-679, (2007); Buwule R.S., (2019); Cant M.C., Wiid J.A., The use of traditional marketing tools by SMEs in an emerging economy: a South African perspective, Problems and Perspectives in Management, 14, 1, (2016); Cao Y., Ajjan H., Hong P., Le T., Using social media for competitive business outcomes, Journal of Advances in Management Research, 15, 2, pp. 211-235, (2018); Chang S.E., Shen W.-C., Liu A.Y., Why mobile users trust smartphone social networking services?

Most of the existing organizations have taken these benefits to actively engage with the public to increase their online business value. The use of hashtags on numerous social media platforms especially on Instagram is one of the highly used benefits. By tagging specific postings, business organizations are able to promote and communicate with their customers directly in a more interactive manner. In this article, the authors are exploring the following: (1) to determine the effectiveness of the existing analytics method (text identification and trend analysis) for analyzing Instagram hashtag data and; (2) to determine the effectiveness of existing analytic techniques such as Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) suited for the selected analytics method. As a result, the authors have identified that the combination of Trend Analysis method and SVM are an effective social media analytics approach for analyzing Instagram hashtag data. © 2019, IGI Global.","Naïve Bayes; Social Media; Support Vector Machines; Text Identification; Trend Analysis","","","","","","","","Batrinca B., Treleaven P.C., Social media analytics: A survey of techniques, tools and platforms, AI & Society, 30, 1, pp. 89-116, (2015); Brief Introduction to Support Vector Machines.; Cvijikj I.P., Michahelles F., Monitoring trends on Facebook, Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing (DASC), pp. 895-902, (2011); Daer A.R., Hoffman R., Goodman S., Rhetorical functions of hashtag forms across social media applications, Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on the Design of Communication CD ROM, (2014); Fan W., Gordon M.D., The power of social media analytics, Communications of the ACM, 57, 6, pp. 74-81, (2014); Ferrara E., Interdonato R., Tagarelli A., Online popularity and topical interests through the lens of Instagram, Proceedings of the 25th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media, pp. 24-34, (2014); Gastelum Z.N., Whattam K.M., State-of-the-Art of Social Media Analytics Research, (2013); Gorvankolla A.K., Rekha B.S., Application of text mining in effective document analysis: Advantages, challenges, techniques and tools, International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology, 6, 4, (2017); Guy I., Zwerdling N., Ronen I., Carmel D., Uziel E., Social media recommendation based on people and tags, Proceedings of the 33rd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 194-201, (2010); Highfield T., Leaver T., A methodology for mapping instagram hashtags, First Monday, 20, 1, (2014); Hu Y., Manikonda L., Kambhampati S., What we instagram: A first analysis of instagram photo content and user types, ICWSM, (2014); Joachims T., Text categorization with support vector machines: Learning with many relevant features, Proceedings of the European Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 137-142, (1998); Khan A., Baharudin B., Lee L.H., Khan K., A review of machine learning algorithms for textdocuments classification, Journal of Advances in Information Technology, 1, 1, pp. 4-20, (2010); Kolowich L., The History of Hashtag [Infographic], (2014); Lee K., Palsetia D., Narayanan R., Patwary M.M.A., Agrawal A., Choudhary A., Twitter trending topic classification, Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, pp. 251-258, (2011); Leung K.M., Naive Bayesian Classifier, (2007); Lin Y.C., Yang P.C., Hsieh W.T., Seng-Cho S.T., Technology trend analysis tool using Twitter as a source, Proceedings of International Conference on Information Technology, E-Government and Application.

After that, there were three steps to the evaluation: a measuring model, a structural model, and a mediation analysis. Findings: Seven out of ten hypotheses were found to be significant, with variances of 73.4% and 10.5% for avoidance motivation and wishful thinking, respectively. Furthermore, rather than having a direct influence on coping approaches, the perceived threat had an indirect effect through the mediation effect of perceived avoidability. Practical implications: This study takes into account Gen-Z women's motivation to be protected from cyberbullying, paving the way for the passage of the digital security act 2018. The data also reveal how to teach these young ladies about the threats of cyberbullying and how to defend themselves. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies to look at the factors that influence Gen-Z women's motivation to use the digital security act 2018 to address cyberbullying. In addition, wishful thinking has been newly included as an emotional coping strategy in this context, along with the present avoidance motivation of TTAT. © 2023 The Authors","Cyberbullying; Digital security act 2018; Generation-z; Social Media; Social networking; TTAT","","","","","","","","Alomar N., Alsaleh M., Alarifi A., Uncovering the predictors of unsafe computing behaviors in online crowdsourcing contexts, Computers & Security, 85, 5, pp. 300-312, (2019); Arachchilage N.A.G., Love S., Security awareness of computer users: A phishing threat avoidance perspective, Computers in Human Behavior, 38, pp. 304-312, (2014); Arachchilage N.A., Love S., Beznosov K., Phishing threat avoidance behaviour: An empirical investigation, Computers in Human Behavior, 60, pp. 185-197, (2016); Aribake F.O., Aji Z.M., Modelling the phishing avoidance behaviour among internet banking users in Nigeria: The initial investigation, Journal of Computer Engineering and Technology, 4, 1, pp. 1-17, (2020); Babu K.E.K., Ullah M.A., Cyber legislation and cyber-related legal issues in Bangladesh: Inadequacies and challenges, International Journal of Electronic Security and Digital Forensics, 13, 2, pp. 180-196, (2021); Bangladesh Computer Council, BGD e-GOV CIRT | Bangladesh e-government computer incident response team, (2019); Bari M.E., Dey P., The enactment of digital security laws in Bangladesh: No place for dissent, George Washington International Law Review, 51, 4, pp. 595-631, (2019); Bax S., McGill T., Hobbs V., Maladaptive behaviour in response to email phishing threats: The roles of rewards and response costs, Computers & Security, 106, pp. 1-14, (2021); Beaudry A., Pinsonneault A., Understanding user responses to information technology: A coping model of user adaption, MIS Quarterly, 29, 3, pp. 493-524, (2005); Betts L.R., Spenser K.A., Gardner S.E., Adolescents' involvement in cyber bullying and perceptions of school: The importance of perceived peer acceptance for female adolescents, Sex Roles, 77, pp. 471-481, (2017); Boysen S., Hewitt B., Gibbs D., McLeod A.J., Refining the threat calculus of technology threat avoidance theory, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 45, 5, pp. 95-115, (2019); Butler M., Butler R., The influence of mobile operating systems on user security behavior, 2021 IEEE 5th international conference on cryptography, security and privacy, pp. 134-138, (2021); Cao G., Duan Y., Edwards J.S., Dwivedi Y.K., Understanding managers' attitudes and behavioral intentions towards using artificial intelligence for organizational decision-making, Technovation, 106, pp. 1-15, (2021); Carpenter D., Young D.K., Barrett P., McLeod A.J., Refining technology threat avoidance theory, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 44, 1, pp. 380-407, (2019); Carver C.S., Scheier M.F., Weintraub J.K., Assessing coping strategies: A theoretically based approach, Journal of personality and social psychology, 56, 2, pp. 267-283, (1989); Cenat J.M., Hebert M., Blais M., Lavoie F., Guerrier M., Derivois D., Cyberbullying, psychological distress and self-esteem among youth in Quebec schools, Journal of Affective Disorders, 169, pp. 1-7, (2014); Chen D., Liang H., Wishful thinking and IT threat avoidance: An extension to the technology threat avoidance theory, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 66, pp. 552-567, (2019); Chin W.W., How to write up and report PLS analyses, Handbook of partial least squares, pp. 655-690, (2010); Choi H.S., Carpenter D., Ko M.S., Risk taking behaviors using public wi-fi, Information Systems Frontiers, 24, 3, pp. 965-982, (2022); Cho V., Ip A.W., A Study of BYOD adoption from the lens of threat and coping appraisal of its security policy, Enterprise Information Systems, 12, pp. 659-673, (2018); Chowdhury F., Bullying of students in academic institutions: A qualitative study, Educational Process: International Journal, 9, 2, pp. 122-132, (2020); Cohen J., Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences, (1988); Daoud J.I., Multicollinearity and regression analysis, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 949, pp. 1-6, (2018); Defenders F., Two years since coming into force, Bangladesh's Digital Security Act continues to target human rights defenders and suppress free speech, Front Line Defenders, (2020); Dhiraj A.B., Countries where cyber-bullying was reported the most in 2018.

To date, there are various types of attendance systems that are applying different technologies such as biometrics, tokens and sensors such as RFID. The latest is by applying near-field communication (NFC), a sensor within the smartphone has been used as a mean for recording attendances. The aim of this paper is to list out the possible security attacks against NFC (Near Field Communication) enabled systems by focusing on a student-based attendance system. A brief overview over NFC technology and discussion on various security attacks against NFC in different media is presented. Overall, an attendance system is compromised mainly by tag swapping, tag cloning and manipulation of data occurring on the NFC device and operational server. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Attendance system; Mitigations; Near Field Communication (NFC); Security attack","Artificial intelligence; Mobile telecommunication systems; Students; Attendance systems; Mitigations; Nfc technologies; Security attacks; Security challenges; Student-based; Tag swapping; The near field communication (NFC); Near field communication","","","","","","","Ozdenizci B., Aydin M., Coskun V., Kerem O.K., NFC Research Framework: A Literature Review and Future Research Directions; Madlmayr G., Langer J., Scharinger J., Kantner C., NFC Devices: Security and Privacy, The Third International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security; Francis L., Hancke G., Mayes K., Markantonakis K., Practical NFC peer-to-peer relay attack using mobile phones, Rfidsec 2010.

Enterprise 2.0, however, with its Web 2.0-based technologies offers the opportunity to leverage the skills and knowledge of the entire organization. But despite the apparent attractiveness of this technology, not all employees are equally willing to adopt and use Enterprise 2.0. In this paper we discuss the phenomenon known as the Empty Quarter which identifies that group of an organization's staff least likely to want to participate in this organizational virtual community, identifying possible reasons for its existence and suggesting some potential solutions. We introduce a preliminary model, the Enterprise 2.0 Uptake Model, to underpin the investigation of this fascinating issue and propose a plan of action for the gathering of appropriate data. We believe this issue is likely to become ever more central as organisations increasingly turn to enterprise content management for their everyday activities. © 2010 IEEE.","","Competition; Industry;

This is one of the early attempts to explicate and describe the patterns of published articles of PEB in the field of Computer Science. From the first article traced in 1976 until 2019, the total numbers of published documents related to pro-environmental behaviour across all disciplines are 2276. However, only 97 documents were found in the field of Computer Science. It is noted that the integration of PEB in Computer Science has indicated an exponential increase in annual publication rate and this trend appears to be evident in developed countries. Specifically, the analysis of productivity according to country/region, institution and funding sponsor suggested that the research landscapes in particularly in Malaysia are paying attention to the intersection of PEB and Computer Sciences. The exploration in the type of publication, source of publication, keyword and language analysis provided the orientation, status and trends of the topic and potential hints to future studies in this field. Overall, progressive trends in publications suggest that the integration of the topic would be continuously published and studied in Malaysia as well as among the international community. © 2020 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.","Behavioural; Bibliometric; Scopus; Sustainability; Trends","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; European Commission, EC; Australian Research Council, ARC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Stichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der Materie, FOM; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Funding text 1: Focusing on published document in PEB, the leading institutions are the University of Queensland, University of Groningen, Universidad de Sonora, University of Leeds and Sejong University.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies should be utilised to advance the tourism sector. This has been proven viable by many researchers globally. However, there is currently a lack of information on the utilisation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies in the Malaysian tourism industry. Crimes such as pickpocketing are also a common occurrence in Kuala Lumpur; hence a way of alerting the tourists of crime hotspots is important, as such events will negatively impact their experience visiting Malaysia. The three main issues that will be focused on in this research are improving the walking navigation of tourists visiting Kuala Lumpur, improving overall tourist safety, and improving the current marketing methods of DBKL (Kuala Lumpur City Hall).

Various studies conducted in other countries have found social media activities has increased especially among the younger generation. As such, the potential online risks on these platforms especially among children has become crucial as the platform usage increases each year. Such situation is also found to be common in different Asian countries especially Malaysia. In this research, a survey was conducted among children between the ages of 7 to 12 years old to identify relevant online activities that increases potential online risks on social media platforms. Based on previous research, three categories of online risks were used to develop the survey scenarios and respondents were required to provide their answers based on them. From the results, it was found that online activities such as photo or video uploads, online video watching, online chatting and commenting on social networking sites could lead to increased potential risks. These online activities influence the risks that is categorized into content, private and contact. © 2017 IEEE.","children; online contact risks; online content risks; online private risks; social media","Risk perception; Surveys; children; On-line contents; Online activities; Online social medias; Social media; Social media platforms; Social networking sites; Younger generations; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Shami N., Lupushor S., Geyer W., Guy I., Ferrar J., Yang J., Panc L., Dugan C., Ratchford T., Rasmussen J.C., Assogba Y.M., Steier T., Soule T., Understanding employee social media chatter with enterprise social pulse, Proc. 17th ACM Conf.

Even though the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled companies to anchorage business returns, most Indonesian MSMEs are highly susceptible to failure and one of the main issues is the inability to manage their financials effectively. The literature on accounting points out that the success of MSMEs owing to the usage of cloud-based Accounting Information Systems (AIS) or Cloud Accounting (CA) could reduce the rate of failure by managing multiple accounting information at a low cost. Although many benefits exist, Indonesian MSMEs are not adopting these platforms in their daily business activities. This study investigates the factors that influence Indonesian MSMEs’ intention to adopt CA. The study is directed by unstructured in-depth interviews with seven bestseller MSMEs where a thematic analysis technique was employed to identify them. The interview findings and prevailing literature on the influencing factors based on the TOE (technological, organizational, and environmental) framework to adopt CA in Indonesian MSMEs context are perceived benefits outweighing the cost, perceived compatibility, perceived complexity, owner-manager knowledge on accounting, organization size, competitive pressure, and informal network. The conceptual model further includes government intervention as a moderator in the model. ©Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","Cloud Accounting; Government Intervention; Indonesian MSMEs; Intention to Adopt; TOE Framework","","","","","","","","Abdul Hameed M., Counsell S., Assessing the influence of environmental and CEO characteristics for adoption of information technology in organizations, Journal of Technology Management & Innovation, 7, 1, pp. 64-84, (2012); Adiyasa H., Hidayanto A.

Therefore, the objectives of this study are to analyze the growth of IoT in recent years and to conduct a weight analysis of the factors that affect acceptance intentions and real usage of IoT-enabled services. For the review, we analyzed 87 publications from 13 conferences and 54 journals published during the period 2014-2020 about consumer adoption of IoT. Following the study, we discovered an unprecedented increase in the number of articles published in the last seven years, which points to an emerging area with an enormous prospect. Furthermore, the weight analysis outcome was associated with the diagrammatic representation in this study. After that, this research developed a generalized consumer IoT adoption model based on the 12 best predictors derived from frequency count and weight analysis, which had the highest predictive power for calculating IoT adoption. This paper further acknowledges the study’s theoretical and practical contributions, as well as its shortcomings, and proposes further research directions for future researchers. © Arif Mahmud, Mohd Heikal Husin, Mohd Najwadi Yusoff, 2022","Diagrammatic representation; Individual-level; Internet of things; Systematic literature review; Weight analysis","","","","","","","","Abushakra A., Nikbin D., Extending the UTAUT2 model to understand the entrepreneur acceptance and adopting Internet of Things (IoT), International Conference on Knowledge Management in Organizations, (2019); Ahmed W, Hizam S.

The results are compared to a similar research conducted in Singapore. The motivation and benefits derived from this research can be used to improve the overall quality of services provided by MyEG and to enhance the efficiency as well as accountability of this e-government service. Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted by applying a theoretical framework known as technology acceptance model involving several factors such as intention to use, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, image, compatibility and trust. The research data were then validated by examining similar factors that had significance results, followed by the development of a simple prototype. Findings: The results obtained from this research would be beneficial to enhance the level of adoption among the citizens in Malaysia. The identification of the different factors influencing the acceptance levels of users can also provide a better vision on the end-user perspective for MyEG developers and lead them to achieve better results in future platform developments. In addition, this study also fills the current existing gap in e-government research of Malaysia and contributes to the literature on the public users’ perspective of e-government services. Practical implications: The results from this research would provide effective guidance to developers of e-government platforms to include specific criteria that would attract the general public in using the platforms. Social implications: Besides that, it provides a new perspective from the general public on their interest to use any e-government platform specifically MyEG. Originality/value: The findings of this research would assist in the improvement of the implementation and adoption of the current MyEG system. Besides that, this research will allow researchers to gain new insights about e-government services and apply the knowledge to further improve the current and other platform development. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Electronic government;

Commonly, users utilize the technology to track the position of a vehicle or an object of interest. They also use it to safely navigate to the destination of their choice. As a result, there are countless number of GPS based tracking application that has been developed. But, a main recurring issue that exists among these applications are the inaccuracy of the tracking faced by users and this issue has become a rising concern. Most existing research have examined the effects that the inaccuracy of GPS have on users while others identified suitable methods to improve the accuracy of GPS based on one or two factors. The objective of this survey paper is to identify the common factors that affects the accuracy of GPS and identify an effective method which could mitigate or overcome most of those factors. As part of our research, we conducted a thorough examination of the existing factors for GPS inaccuracies. According to an initial survey that we have collected, most of the respondents has faced some form of GPS inaccuracy. Among the common issues faced are inaccurate object tracking and disconnection of GPS signal while using an application. As such, most of the respondents agree that it is necessary to improve the accuracy of GPS. This leads to another objective of this paper, which is to examine and evaluate existing methods as well as to identify the most effective method that could improve the accuracy of GPS. © 2016, Academy and Industry Research Collaboration Center (AIRCC).","Accuracy factors; Global positioning system; GPS; Improve accuracy","","","","","","","","Lin J.Y., Yang B.K., Tuan A.D., Chen H.C., The Accuracy Enhancement of GPS Track in Google Map, 2013 Eighth International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, pp. 524-527, (2013); Iqbal A., Mahmood H., Farooq U., Kabir M.A., Asad M.U., An Overview of the Factors Responsible for GPS Signal Error: Origin and Solution, pp. 294-299, (2009); Bajaj R., Ranaweera S.L., Agrawal D.P., GPS: Location-tracking Technology, Computer, 35, 4, pp. 92-94; Huang J.Y., Tsai C.H., Improve GPS Positioning Accuracy with Context Awareness, pp. 94-99, (2008); Wubbena G., Andreas B., Seeber G., Boder V., Hankemeier P., Reducing Distance Dependant Errors for Real-Time Precise DGPS Applications by Establishing Reference Station Networks, Proceedings of the 9th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation (ION GPS-96), (1996); Enge P., Walter T., Pullen S., Kee C., Chao Y., Tsai Y., Wide area augmentation of the global positioning system, Proceedings of the IEEE, pp. 1063-1088, (1996); Qi H., Moore J.B., Direct Kalman Filtering Approach for GPS/INS Integration, IEEE Trans.

A survey instrument was developed from the findings of earlier focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, which were based on the adaptation and adoption of previous studies, especially Kollmuss and Agyeman’s 2002 Model of Pro-Environmental Behaviour and a modified Knowledge-Attitude-Practises Model. Three hundred ninety-three respondent samples from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Universiti Putra Malaysia, and Universiti Sains Malaysia were analysed for their insights regarding their vision of a Zero-Waste Campus using the Structural Equation Modelling approach. The results show positive relationships between the five studied variables and the proposed hypotheses. Knowledge and attitudes serve as moderating variables, enhancing the strength of the causal effects of the related relationships. As the results show good significance, proper planning for integrating the studied variables and the proposed zero-waste campus framework can be used by university management, other institutions, or national-level agencies to develop an environment-specific plan to promote zero-waste, pro-environmental behaviour. © 2023 by the authors.","KAP; pro-environmental behaviour; Structural Equation Modelling; university; zero-waste","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (LRGS MRUN/F2/01/2019/2/2)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for a long-term research project (Project Code: LRGS MRUN/F2/01/2019/2/2).","Abubakar I.R., Maniruzzaman K.M., Dano U.L., AlShihri F.S., AlShammari M.S., Ahmed S.M.S., Al-Gehlani W.A.G., Alrawaf T.I., Environmental Sustainability Impacts of Solid Waste Management Practices in the Global South, Int.

Our research which was conducted among Malaysian children has found that such reliance is quite evident as well. As this need increases, the exposure to issues such as cyberbullying also increases. A survey was conducted among children from 9 to 12 years old in order to identify such reliance. The objective of this study is to identify the existing level of social media usages among Malaysian children. From the initial results, media sharing and social networking has become the most popular sites among the children. This indicates that further exploration into the usage trends among children as social media platforms becomes more utilized by the younger generation. © 2016 IEEE.","Children; Initial perspective; Social media; Web usage","Information science; Children; Cyber bullying; Initial perspective; Social media; Social media platforms; User-generated content; Web usage; Younger generations; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Leiner B., Cerf V., Clark D., Kahn R., Kleinrock L., Lynch D., Postel J., Roberts L., Wolff S., A brief history of the internet, ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 39, 5, pp. 22-31, (2009); O'Reilly T., What is web 2.0: Design patterns and business models for the next generation of software, Communications & Strategies, 1, (2007); Bowe B.J., Wohn D.Y., Are there generational differences?

Through an interpretive content analysis within a media and consulting company, as well as extensive literature review, this paper highlights the role policy plays within organisations and the typical procedures that an organisation goes through when developing an appropriate social media policy. Findings from the research indicate that traditional policy development processes are unsuitable for social media implementation. Some reasons include the blurring of home-work boundaries; the widespread availability of social media tools; and the scope of their use. This is where our new framework is able to shed some light. Our research has uncovered that through increased feedback from various layers of management, new social media policies can be developed to embrace changing situations that are not anticipated with traditional tools, such as email.","Enterprise 2.0; Guidelines; Organisations; Policies; Social media","Industry; Information systems; Public policy; Content analysis; Guidelines; Literature reviews; Organisations; Policy development; Policy development process; Social media; Societies and institutions","","","","","","","Alexander P., Social media 101: A beginner's guide for finance employees, Australian Government Information Management Office, (2010); Allen K., Developing trends and challenges for the information industry examined in the context of the online information conference, Business Information Review, 25, 2, pp. 81-85, (2008); Althaus C., Bridgman P., Davis G., The Australian Policy Handbook, 4, (2008); Arts B., Tatenhove J.V., Policy and power: A conceptual framework between the 'Old' and 'New' policy idioms, Policy Sciences, 37, 3-4, pp. 339-356, (2004); Boulton C., IBM's Social Beehive and Discovery Search, (2008); Brynjolfsson E., McAfee A.P., Beyond enterprise 2.0, Sloan Management Review, 48, 3, pp. 50-55, (2007); Bughin J., The rise of enteprise 2.0, Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice, 9, 3, pp. 251-259, (2008); Burton G., Blogs and wikis 'ten years in the making, Inside Knowledge, (2006); Cook N., Enterprise 2.0: How Social Software Will Change the Future of Work, (2008); Cummings J.N., Butler B., Kraut R., The quality of online social relationships, Commun.

The methodology employs the practices of continuous integration and delivery and places the deployment pipeline as the main requirement to automate, deliver and operate software in a robust way, without compromising on the quality in the software development process. Over time, many systems and tools have been developed to implement the deployment pipeline and support the continuous delivery process. A pipeline splits the process of software delivery into various stages. Each stage is designed to verify the quality of new features from a new perspective to attest to the functionality and prevent either small or big errors from impacting the end users. The pipeline must provide a response and feedback loop to the concerned team and provide a window into the flow of changes that takes place. However, there is no clear rule to define what goes into a pipeline. This paper reviews the challenges of quality assurance of DevOps and provides tentative recommendations to deal with quality issues. Our proposed pipeline with analytic features is expected to provide accurate metrics on a real-time basis. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Continuous delivery; Continuous deployment; Continuous integration; Deployment pipeline; DevOps; Devops analytics; Quality assurance","Application programs; Continuous time systems; DevOps; Quality assurance; Software design; Continuous delivery; Continuous deployment; Continuous integrations; Delivery process; Feed-back loop; Quality issues; Real time; Software development process; Pipelines","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (304.PKOMP.6316282)","The authors would like to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia Bridging Research Grant Scheme (304.PKOMP.6316282) for the financial support.","Chakraborty A., Ramachandran K.K., Yamijala S.S.R.K.C., Pati S.K., Maji T.K., A hexanuclear Cu(i) cluster supported by cuprophilic interaction: Effects of aromatics on luminescence properties, RSC Adv, 4, 66, pp. 35167-35170, (2014); Shahin M., Zahedi M., Ali Babar M., Zhu L., Babar M.A., Zhu L., An Empirical Study of Architecting for Continuous Delivery and Deployment, (2018); Perera P., Silva R., Perera I., Improve software quality through practicing DevOps, 17th International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions, ICTer 2017 - Proceedings, 2018, pp. 13-18, (2018); Qumer Gill A., Loumish A., Riyat I., Han S., Devops for information management, VINE J.

Even though MSMEs have resources limitation, they can utilize the essential advantages of AIS through cloud computing. This paper proposes a conceptual model that influences an intention to adopt cloud accounting (ITAC) among MSMEs by using constructs that had been investigated in a preliminary study and aligned with such literature of the existing technology adoption theory. The theory of TAM-TOE is integrated by involving variables such as the cloud computing characteristic (CA), organizational readiness (OR), mimetic pressure (MP), government intervention (GI), perceived ease of use (PEOU), and perceived usefulness (PU) of MSMEs owner-managers on the cloud accounting. Based on a pre-testing study through a survey of MSMEs in Indonesia, the result shows the validity and reliability of scale measurement and supports its potential for a full-scale study. The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of the cloud accounting adoption among MSMEs in developing countries. © School of Engineering, Taylor's University","Cloud accounting; Indonesian MSMEs;

However, its literature review has not been exhaustive. As a result, the primary objective of this work is to contain a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in PMT in the generic domain, as well as a weighted review of the variables that aid in the theory's expansion. Following that, we independently assessed 138 papers published between 2014 and 2020 in 92 journals and 12 conferences. We discovered an astonishing increase in the number of publications over the last seven years throughout our analysis, indicating that the theory is consuming stability and promise in its application. Additionally, the weight analysis result was attributed to the diagrammatic portrayal of significant and non-significant associations in this study. Weight analysis indicated that coping-appraisal variables had a higher predictive validity than threat-appraisal variables, with self-efficacy being the most effective predictor. Apart from the standard constructs, the most often occurring and heavily weighted factors were Attitude and Subjective norm. Further, the inconsistency of the theory variables has been noted and the inclusion of moderators has been proposed accordingly in this study. © 2022, Success Culture Press.

Most of the current research on mobile organizers highlights that most users rely on the application as an effective tool to manage their daily activities especially among university students. A mobile organizer application is software that acts as a personal assistant for users to help them manage their time and activities. From a Malaysian context, the usage of these applications among university students has not been explored in-depth. The aim of this paper is to initially explore the current usage of mobile organizers within a Malaysian university specifically Universiti Sains Malaysia. There are a number of requirements that a mobile organizer application should fulfil, in order to be effective for users. In order to identify these requirements, an initial survey was conducted in order to identify these requirements, which, would then be incorporated into the development of a mobile organizer suitable for Malaysian university students. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Applications; Mobile organizers; Software","","","","","","","","Cisco Visual Networking Index: Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2013-2018, (2014); Zulkefly S.N., Baharudin R., Mobile phone use amongst students in a university in Malaysia: its correlates and relationship to psychological health, European Journal of Scientific Research, 37, 2, pp. 206-218, (2009); Vavoula G.N., Sharples M., KLeOS: a personal, mobile, knowledge and learning organisation system, Paper presented at the IEEE International Workshop on Wireless and Mobile Technologies in Education, (2002); Balakrishnan V., Raj R.G., Exploring the relationship between urbanized Malaysian youth and their mobile phones: A quantitative approach, Telematics and Informatics, 29, 3, pp. 263-272, (2012); Mirisaee S.H., Zin A.M., A Framework for Context-Aware University Mobile Organizer, (2009); Bolton R.N., Parasuraman A., Hoefnagels A., Migchels N., Kabadayi S., Gruber T., Loureiro Y.K., Solnet D., Understanding Generation Y and their use of social media: a review and research agenda, Journal of Service Management, 24, 3, pp. 245-267, (2013); Al Tunaiji A., Zemerly M.J., MUSO: An Mlearning & University Student Organizer platform, (2010); Population Distribution and Basic Demographic Characteristics, Department of Statistics Malaysia, (2010); Badroddin S., Pakih S., Indikator Pengajian Tinggi Malaysia 2011-2012, (2012); Jumlah Enrolmen Pelajar Antarabangsa Di Institusi Pengajian Tinggi (IPT) Mengikut Negara Asal, Tahun 2003-2009, (2009); Vavoula G.N., Sharples M., Requirements for the design of lifelong learning organisers, pp. 23-26, (2002); Mirisaee S.H., Zin A.M., Determining IT students problems in an university environment and proposing a solution by a wireless organizer, Paper presented at the International Symposium on Information Technology, pp. 26-28, (2008); Mirisaee S.H., Zin A.M., A Context-Aware Mobile Organizer for University Students, Journal of Computer Science, 5, 12, pp. 898-904, (2010); Hanson V.L., Age and web access: the next generation.

However, there are no studies training an unsupervised model to automatically categorize the social networks (SN) messages according to personality traits. Most of the existing literature relied on the Big 5 framework and psychological reports to recognize the personality of users. Furthermore, collecting datasets for other personality themes is an inherent problem that requires unprecedented time and human efforts, and it is bounded with privacy constraints. Alternatively, this study hypothesized that a small set of seed words is enough to decipher the psycholinguistics states encoded in texts, and the auxiliary knowledge could synergize the unsupervised model to categorize the messages according to human traits. Therefore, this study devised a dataless model called Seed-guided Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SLDA) to categorize the SN messages according to the PEN model that comprised Psychoticism, Extraversion, and Neuroticism traits. The intrinsic evaluations were conducted to determine the performance and disclose the nature of texts generated by SLDA, especially in the context of Psychoticism. The extrinsic evaluations were conducted using several machine learning classifiers to posit how well the topic model has identified latent semantic structure that persists over time in the training documents. The findings have shown that SLDA outperformed other models by attaining a coherence score up to 0.78, whereas the machine learning classifiers can achieve precision up to 0.993. We also will be shared the corpus generated by SLDA for further empirical studies. © 2022 by the authors.

Existing researches have shown that new systems require novice users to spend an amount of time to get to know the technology. Near Field Communication (NFC) is an emerging technology, which offers an enhanced interaction for users by simplifying data transfers, secured payment transaction access and many more. In this paper, we looked into a number of widely used acceptance models such as the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theory Planned Behavior (TPB) and, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to identify the theory that is best suited as an assessment tool of the user acceptance to the NFC technology. We have identified UTAUT as the best tool based on literature and utilized the theory to develop a questionnaire for the user acceptance survey. Our results indicates, factors such as social influence and facilitating condition affected the users' technology acceptance for NFC where most respondents are willing to use the technology if they had the chance to do so. © 2015 IEEE.","Near Field Communication; Technology Acceptance Model; Unified Theory of Acceptance and Usage of Technology","Data transfer; Economic and social effects; Electronic money; Industrial management; Mobile telecommunication systems; Surveys; Emerging technologies; Facilitating conditions; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; The near field communication (NFC); The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Theory of reasoned action; Unified theory; Near field communication","","","","","","","Steffen R., Preiinger J., Schollermann T., Muller A., Near Field Communication (NFC) in an automative environent, Second International Workshop on Near Field Communication, pp. 15-20, (2010); Dillon A., Morris M., User acceptance of information and technology: Theories and models, Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 31, pp. 3-32, (1996); Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly, 13, pp. 319-340, (1989); Venkatesh V., Davis F.D., A theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model: Four longitudinal field studies, Management Science, 2, pp. 186-204, (2000); Venkatesh V., Creation of favorable user perceptions: Exploring the role of intrinsic motivation, MIS Quarterly, 2, pp. 239-260, (1999); Venkatesh V., User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view, MIS Quarterly, 27, 3, pp. 425-478, (2003); Fishbein M., Ajzen I., Believe, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior:An Introduction to Theory and Research, (1975); Au S., Parameswaran N., Problem solving with attitude and the theory of reasoned action, IEEE/WIC International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology IEEE, pp. 1-4, (2003); Teh P., Ahmed P.K., MOA and TRA in social Commerce: An intergrated model, Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management Singapore IEEE, pp. 1375-1378, (2011); Sogani S., Muduganti R., Hexmoor H., Davis F., Introducing agent based implementation of the theory of reasoned action: A case study in user acceptance of computer technology, KIMAS International Conference IEEE, pp. 507-510, (2005); Ajzen I., Constructing A Theory of Planned Behavior Questionnaire, pp. 1-12, (2006); Lin T.C., Hsu M.H., Kuo F.Y., Sun P.C., An intention Model-based study of software piracy, 32nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences IEEE, (1999); Lu Y., Zhou T., Wang B., Exploring Chinese user' acceptance of instant messaging using the theory of planned behavior, the technology acceptance model, and the flow theory, Computer in Human Behavior, 25, pp. 29-39, (2009); Lin J., Chan H.C., Wei K.K., Understanding competing web application platforms : An extended theory of planned behavior and its relative model, Engineering Management, 58, (2011); Wu Y., Tao Y., Yang P., Using UTAUT to explore the behavior of3G mobile communication users, Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM) Singapore IEEE, pp. 209-212, (2007); Gao T., Deng Y., A study on users' acceptance behavior to mobile E-books application based on UTAUT model, ICSESS3rd International Conference Beijing IEEE, (2012)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2nd International Symposium on Technology Management and Emerging Technologies, ISTMET 2015","25 August 2015 through 27 August 2015","Langkawi","118506","","978-147991723-5","","","English","Int.

Internet of things (IoT), in contrast, is commonly recognized as among the most advanced home security systems. However, the factors that attract young people to use IoT for household security have yet to be examined. Consequently, the purpose of this article is to validate the attitude-social influence-self-efficacy (ASE) model with personal innovativeness and perceived trust. We collected data from Dhaka citizens aged 15 to 24 using a purposive sample technique and 370 valid responses were chosen for the study. According to the analysis, all of our proposed hypotheses were found significant with a 73.6% variance. Furthermore, the effects of attitude and social influence were shown to be the highest and lowest, respectively, and trust and innovativeness were both nearly strong main predictors of ASE. Significantly, since this is one of the few studies in the technology adoption domain using this model, a solid foundation for IoT adoption for security purposes is established. © 2022,Asia Pacific Journal of Information Systems.

The organisations should be aware of a number of issues when implementing Web 2.0 internally. This paper introduces a theoretical model that highlights the importance of management, technology and people issues influencing the level of Web 2.0 usage from an internal perspective. The purpose of this paper was to identify and explore these issues in a government context. Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses a mixed-method (qualitative and quantitative) analysis to identify the issues that should be focused on for achieving effective usage of Web 2.0 among government employees. A combination of interviews, surveys and usage data collected from two government organisations was used to gather the data. Findings – The main finding is that, a policy will act as an initial catalyst for culture change and effective usage of Web 2.0 technologies in a government environment. It was also found that it is important to develop an understanding among senior management about the motivation for their employees to utilise Web 2.0 internally. As a result, the proposed theoretical model could assist government organisations in developing effective adoption approaches through identifying their employees’ motivation to adopt Web 2.0 technologies and developing a suitable organisational social media policy. Research limitations/implications – There is the issue of the small number of both qualitative and quantitative respondents within the research. Such limitation is because the research relies solely on the voluntary participation of the employees. This limitation was coupled with the fact that both organisations had different security requirements that had affected the amount and level of feasible information that was accessible to the researchers. Practical implications – This paper extends the understanding of issues applicable to the adoption of Web 2.0 tools from a government organisations’ perspective. The developed theoretical model acts as an adoption guide for organisations to achieve effective Web2.0 tools usage. At the same time, this paper also examines related motivation aspects which higher management should consider while using a new social media or Web 2.0 platform internally. Originality/value – This paper highlights suitable overview approaches for organisations to consider in increasing adoption of Web 2.0 among their employees. This paper also provides an initial foray into identifying other complex issues that may exist within different government organisations in relation to internal technology usage. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Employee motivation; Government 2.0; Internal usage; Policy development; Risk mitigation","","","","","","","","Alvesson M., Understanding Organizational Culture, (2012); Arasanmi C., Wang W.Y.C., Singh H., Ekundayo S., What motivates end-users to transfer gained knowledge from enterprise systems training?, (2011); Auerbach C.F., Silverstein L.B., Qualitative Data: An Introduction to Coding and Analysis, (2003); Bertot J.C., Jaeger P.T., Grimes J.M., Using ICTs to create a culture of transparency: e-government and social media as openness and anti-corruption tools for societies, Government Information Quarterly, 27, 3-7, pp. 264-271, (2010); Bertot J.C., Jaeger P.T., Grimes J.M., Promoting transparency and accountability through ICTs, social media, and collaborative e-government, Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, 6, 1, pp. 78-91, (2012); Bertot J.C., Jaeger P.T., Hansen D., The impact of policies on government social media usage: issues, challenges, and recommendations, Government Information Quarterly, 29, 1, pp. 30-40, (2012); Carter L., Belanger F., The utilization of e-government services: citizen trust, innovation and acceptance factors*, Information Systems Journal, 15, 1, pp. 5-25, (2005); Creswell J.W., Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches, (2009); Dadashzadeh M., Social media in government: from egovernment to egovernance, Journal of Business & Economic Research, 8, 11, pp. 81-86, (2010); Dasgupta S., Gupta B., Dwivedi Y.K., Henriksen H.Z., Wastell D., De R., Organization culture dimensions as antecedents of internet technology adoption, Grand Successes and Failures in IT.

Age society often suffers from common problems such as Alzheimer's disease that disrupts their daily life. Moreover, it restricted their activity area, safety and freedom in their daily life. Hence, a tracking system is good for their relatives or guardian to track their location and path. When the population of aged society increases and the number of elders being lost increases, current tracking and monitoring systems are unable to satisfy the needs of the community. Hence, a smart tracking and monitoring system that automatically tracks and monitor these elderly person is required. INdoor-OuTdoor Elderly CAring SystEm (NOTECASE) is a real-time tracking and monitoring system that utilizes the RFID, Wi-Fi, and Global Location Positioning System (GPS) aim to track and monitor the aged society, both within indoors and outdoors environment.

The existing literature emphasizes that big data applications and analytics can empower those who apply Big Data Analytics during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper reviews the existing literature specializing in big data applications pre and peri-COVID-19. A comparison between Pre and Peri of the pandemic for using Big Data applications is presented. The comparison is expanded to four highly recognized industry fields: Healthcare, Education, Transportation, and Banking. A discussion on the effectiveness of the four major types of data analytics across the mentioned industries is highlighted. Hence, this paper provides an illustrative description of the importance of big data applications in the era of COVID-19, as well as aligning the applications to their relevant big data analytics models. This review paper concludes that applying the ultimate big data applications and their associated data analytics models can harness the significant limitations faced by organizations during one of the most fateful pandemics worldwide.

The associated heavier workloads together with tension and pressure often lead to stress-related health problems. People do really deserve a good rest when they come home from their office. As a result, the proposed solution-The Eye 2H is an intelligent system that will use the technique of image processing and face recognition to detect and analyze the human emotion to control the electronic equipment in their house through an intelligent control box. There are several studies highlighted that by controlling the brightness of light, we could affect the emotion or behavior of humans. Thus, we believe that The Eye 2H is capable to fulfill the main objective of the project which is to provide a better living environment for people in order to provide them a harmony and happy (2H) living life. The Eye 2H is capable of boosting the mood and emotion of the residents by controlling the electronic equipment in their house. The feature of turning on light automatically as well as fine-tune the brightness of light according to human emotion mood will give a 'welcoming home' effect to the house owner. Besides that, The Eye 2H is also a green technology project as it will support the Go Green concept by reducing the energy usage. © 2014 IEEE.","automated light control; lighting effects; smart lights; stress","Automation; Electronic equipment; Energy utilization; Houses; Image processing; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent systems; Luminance; Man machine systems; Oscillators (electronic); Stresses; Energy usage; Green technology; Human emotion; Increasing costs; Light control; Lighting effects; Living environment; Smart homes; Face recognition","","","","","","","Ramos H., Mustafa M., Chin M., The moderating effects of personality on work-family conflicts and stress among Malaysian working parents, International Journal of Management Practice, 5, 3, pp. 225-244, (2012); Allen T.D., Kiburz K.M., Trait mindfulness and work-family balance among working parents: The mediating effects of vitality and sleep quality, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 80, 2, pp. 372-379, (2012); Harris Interactive: 'Stress in the Workplace, (2011); Miller G.E., Chen E., Parker K.J., Psychological stress in childhood and susceptibility to the chronic diseases of aging: Moving toward a model of behavioral and biological mechanisms, Psychological Bulletin, 137, 6, pp. 959-997, (2011); Sanders M.R., Stallman H.M.M., Workplace Triple P: A controlled evaluation of a parenting intervention for working parents., Journal of Family Psychology, 25, 4, pp. 581-590, (2011); Chebat J.C., Michon R., Impact of ambient odors on mall shoppers' emotions, cognition, and spending: A test of competitive causal theories, Journal of Business Research, 56, 7, pp. 529-539, (2003); Laganier V., Pol Der J.Van, Lights and Emotions, (2011); Davis S., Mirick D.K., Stevens R.G., Night shift work, light at night, and risk of breast cancer, Journal of the National Cancel Institute, 93, 20, pp. 1557-1562, (2001); Drake C.L., Roehrs T., Richardson G., Walsh J.K., Roth T., Shift work sleep disorder: Prevalence and consequences beyond that of symptomatic day workers, Sleep, 27, 8, pp. 1453-1462, (2004); Aldrich F., Smart homes: Past, present and future, Inside the Smart Home, pp. 17-39, (2003); Harper R., Inside the Smart Home: Ideas, Possibilities and Methods': 'Inside the Smart Home, pp. 1-13, (2003); Taylor A.S., Harper R., Swan L., Izadi S., Sellen A., Perry M., Homes that make us smart, Personal Ubiquitous Comput, 11, 5, pp. 383-393, (2007); Jahn M., Jentsch M., Prause C.R., Pramudianto F., Al-Akkad A., Reiners R., The energy aware smart home, Proc. 2010 5th International Conference on Future Information Technology (FutureTech), Busan, South Korea, pp. 1-8, (2010); De Carrera P.F., Face Recognition Algorithms, (2010)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2014 5th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology for the Muslim World, ICT4M 2014","17 November 2014 through 18 November 2014","Kuching","110287","","978-147996242-6","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

For almost a century since the white cane was first introduced, the cane has remained as the most reliable tool for those affected by blindness. Methods: By using a combination of the capabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) and existing devices, such as mobile phones, an InWalker system is proposed to expand the functionality of the typical white cane, so as to introduce several new features that enhance the safety and confidence amongst people who are blind. As such, this paper explores the existing works and projects to comprehend the motivation and the standard practices for each proposed feature. Each of the strength and drawback has been assessed thoroughly to refine the scope of this project. Results: The proposed project, InWalker, is an intelligent system that has an embedded board system with various sensors to enhance the usability of white cane. The inputs from the sensor are processed on a microcontroller, which then pass the data to a smartphone via Bluetooth for additional features, such as global positioning system (GPS) tracking and SMS services. Conclusions: Based on the initial user testing, the proposed system has successfully fulfilled most of the users’ need.Implication for Rehabilitation Visual impairment is a disability more commonly caused by diseases that lead to several disadvantages amongst those blind. The white cane has been seen as the most reliable tool for the visual impaired. This tool could be further improved with the integration of additional sensors that works with today’s mobile devices. The proposed system, InWalker, is able to improve the overall quality of life among people who are blind through several features: obstacle detection, GPS tracking and a light illumination in dark environments for increased safety. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","embedded board system; Internet of Things; Smart white cane; visual impairment","Canes; Equipment Design; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Self-Help Devices; Smartphone; Text Messaging; Visually Impaired Persons; cane; devices; equipment design; geographic information system; human; rehabilitation; self help device; smartphone; text messaging; visually impaired person","","","","","","","(2017); Pascolini D., Mariotti S., Global estimates of visual impairment: 2010, Br J Ophthalmol, 96, pp. 614-618, (2012); (2017); (2017); Tunde-Ayinmode M.F., (2017); Bickford T., Care and feeding of the long white cane, (1993); Blasch B, Long R, Griffin-Shirley N.

The inventions of online networks technologies and applications such as social networks rapidly growth the size of digital textual data and indirectly raises the curiosities to mine the juicy information encapsulated in the text data. Researchers have stated that linguistics of the people either in the online or offline having strong correlations with their self-disclosure. The mass creations of digital textual data raised the intentions of scholars to study the hidden abstractions of personality by applying automatic personality detection approaches. Most of the current automatic personality detection studies focused on Big 5 personality model as a framework to study the underlying characteristics of human. As such, this study incorporates the Three Factor Personality (PEN) Model as a personality framework to guide our understanding and revealing the role of words in depicting the characteristics of a user. This preliminary study revealed how the sentiment perceptions of public towards specific words could assist us in detecting the personality of Facebook users by exploiting their status messages. As the first phase of our study, this experiment focuses on gathering the general perceptions of Malaysians towards 52 English words and 17 interjections that was retrieve from the domain stated above. A Likert scale questionnaire executed to find the sentiment valences of 67 words through analyzing responses from participants and statistical significance will assist the categorization of words under PEN traits. The evaluation provides the necessary analysis that could assist our main research that focuses on automatic personality detections specifically on the psychoticism trait. Our initial findings has highlighted that the five words categorized under psychoticism has strong Cronbach's Alpha coefficients and significant effect from multivariate analysis that indirectly affirmed the reliability of the categorization of the words. © 2015 The Authors.","Automatic Personality Perception; Sentiment valence; Three Factor Model","Information systems; Multivariant analysis; Reliability analysis; Social sciences computing; Automatic personality perceptions; Multi variate analysis; On-line social networks; Personality detections; Sentiment valence; Statistical significance; Technologies and applications; Three-factor model; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Tolga Aricak O., Psychiatric Symptomatology as a Predictor of Cyberbullying among University Students, Eurasian Journal of Educational Research, 34, pp. 167-184, (2009); Ellis, The Study of Personality, (2008); Matthews G., Deary I., Martha C., Personality Traits, (2003); Kirwan G., Power A., The Psychology of Cyber Crime: Concepts and Principles, (2011); Rahim Kamaluddin M., Syariani Md Shariff N., Othman A., Hj Ismail K., Ayu Mat Saat G., Linking psychological traits with Criminal behavior: A review, Linking Pychological Traits with Criminal Behaviour: A Review ASEAN Journal of Psychiatry, 16, 2, (2015); Mairesse F., Et al., Using Linguistic Cues for the Automatic Recognition of Personality in Conversation and Text, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 30, 2007, pp. 457-500; Bradley M.M., Lang P.J., Affective norms for English words (ANEW): Instruction manual and affective ratings, Technical Report C-1, the Center for Research in Psychophysiology, (1999); Arup Nielsen F., A new ANEW: Evaluation of a word list for sentiment analysis in microblogs, Proceedings of the ESWC2011 Workshop on 'Making Sense of Microposts': Big Things Come in Small Packages 718 in CEUR Workshop Proceedings, (2011); Vasa R.A., Et al., Valence ratings of emotional and non-emotional words in children, Personality and Individual Differences, 41, pp. 1169-1180, (2004); Oberlander J., Nowson S., Whose thumb is it anyway?

Therefore, this research combines two technology adoption theories of technology-organizational-environmental and diffusion of innovation (TOE-DOI) theories to identify the influencing factors and develop a model for the adoption of cloud computing in academic libraries. A quantitative technique using survey design was adopted and previously used scales were adapted and formulated structured questionnaires. The study population comprises decision-makers from North-Eastern Nigerian academic libraries and purposive sampling was used in selecting 212 sample respondents where 192 were found usable. Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) and Partial Least Square–Structured Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used for analyzing the data. Findings revealed that all the independent variables (relative advantage, compatibility, technophobia, government regulations and competitive pressure) were significant factors in the adoption of cloud computing in academic libraries. In contrast, the moderating variable (perceived trust) was found to be insignificant in all the relationships. Based on this finding, it is recommended that the significant factors should be given serious attention when deciding to adopt cloud computing by academic libraries. The moderating variable should be tested in future studies to ascertain its effect in that context. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Academic libraries; Cloud adoption factors; Cloud computing; Cloud computing adoption; North-Eastern Nigeria","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/SS0/USM/02/4)","Acknowledgment to “ Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme Project with Project Code: FRGS/1/2020/SS0/USM/02/4 ”.

Many studies have offered important insights into this model. Nevertheless, regarding the e-learning body of knowledge, DM research remains to be systematically reviewed comprehensively. E-learning refers to the use of information technology to disseminate knowledge for education and training. With today's e-learning boom necessitated for the most part by COVID-19, its adoption has become increasingly mandatory. Thus, a systematic review should help focus and accelerate future research. This study systematically reviews, compiles, analyzes, and synthesizes the DM model studies in the e-learning context. This review adopts automatic and manual search methods to collect related studies from 2010 to 2020. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 92 primary studies are identified. The findings show that most of reviewed studies were conducted in the education field. The success category was the most highly investigated area from among the selected studies. Most studies developed a hybrid/extended model. Additionally, this study also identified gaps in the literature and recommends seven potential future areas requiring further investigation, such as conducting studies to examine the net benefits at the organizational level of analysis. To that end, the findings of this systematic review study provide an impactful contribution through offering a holistic review of the current state of DM model studies in an e-learning context, providing an essential reference for scholars in this field. © 2013 IEEE.","DeLone & McLean information systems success model; e-Learning systems; learning management systems; Moodle; systematic literature review","E-learning; Information systems; Information use; Body of knowledge; Critical dimension; Education and training; Inclusion and exclusions; Information systems success; Information systems success models; Organizational levels; Systematic Review; Learning systems","","","","","","","Aparicio M., Bacao F., Oliveira T., Trends in the E-learning ecosystem: A bibliometric study, Proc. 20th Americas Conf.

Hardcopy documents has been one of the items that most organizations need to manage in a safe and secure manner due to the high dependency on most of their working procedure especially in government organizations. Hence, we proposed a new framework to improve the weaknesses of the existing document management procedures in government organizations. Our proposed framework integrates the implementation of an NFC system in this research due to its secure short - range communication, and the peer-to-peer communication capability in most mobile devices. Besides that, most existing government organizations within Malaysia could easily implement such technology for their internal usage as this technology is cost effective due to its availability on existing mobile devices on most Android based devices. © 2018, Siti Salbiah Zainal Abidin and Mohd Heikal Husin.","Accessibility; Document management system; Malaysian e-government; NFC; Security","","","","","","","","AlMahafzah H., Zaid AlRwashdeh M., A survey of multibiometric systems, (2012); Baidya J., Design and implementation of a fingerprint based lock system for shared access, Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC), pp. 1-6, (2017); Sustainable Open Innovation in Government: Practical Application in Cities and Beyond, (2018); Bernama, Government is citizens’ true partner, Ali Hamsa says’, (2018); Ashraf Chattha N., NFC—Vulnerabilities and defense, 2014 Conference on Information Assurance and Cyber Security (CIACS), pp. 35-38, (2014); Henry C., Vanhaverbeke W., West J., Open innovation: researching a new paradigm, (2006); Collins, Definition of ‘security’, (2018); Symantec Web and Cloud Security, (2017); Cullen J., Peairs M., Document management system, (1999); Dixon E., Biometric access – enabling patrons to log in and check out with a swipe of the finger’, (2015); Duarte T., Biometric access control systems: a review on technologies to improve their efficiency, Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (PEMC), pp. 795-800, (2016); Economic Planning Unit, Prime Minister’s Department, (2017); Ministry of Higher Education, egBiometric, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; Nick W., Shelton J., Sabol C., Esterline A., Federated protocol for biometric authentication and access control, pp. 854-862, (2017); Eun H., Lee H., Oh H., Conditional privacy preserving security protocol for NFC applications, IEEE Trans.

However, issue arises when cyberbullies are able to reach their victims through these social media platforms. There are different types of cyberbullying and like traditional bullying; it causes victims to feel overly selfconscious, increases their tendency to self-harm and generally affects their mental state negatively. Such situations occur due to security issues such as user anonymity and the lack of content restrictions in some social networks or web forums. In this paper, we highlight the existing solutions, which are Intrusion Prevention System and Intrusion Detection System from a number of researchers. However, even with such solutions, cyberbullying acts still occurs at an alarming rate. As such, we proposed an alternative solution that aims to prevent cyberbullying activities at a younger age, e.g., young children. The application would provide an alternative method to preventing cyberbullying activities among the younger generations in the future. © 2017 KIPS.","Cyberbullying; Digital etiquette; Intrusion detection system;

The study reveals that most of the employees have positive perceptions about the industrial current practice on Industry 4.0 and identified the prospective demands on the professions that will be affected. Five significant areas of required competencies found in this study are adaptability, soft skills, software engineering, data analytics, and technical skills. The findings provide empirical evidence about current and future employment scenarios in Malaysia concerning the possible impact of Industry 4.0 on the companies and issues involved in managing the transition to Industry 4.0. Besides, the emergent skills required by workforces that are previously unaddressed in the literature were identified. Empirical evidence from the analysis contributes to shaping the educational systems of the future and helps to proactively identify specific skills shortages at an early stage. © The Author(s) 2022.","future talents;

It has therefore become essential to develop policies guiding the use of social media within organisations. The need to protect an organisation’s interests by guiding employees’ appropriate use of social media is a key issue for senior managers. This issue has to be balanced against the benefits of empowering employees to make use of social media in flexible, innovative ways. This paper highlights the major components of a social media policy, based on the Social Media and Organisation Policy (SOMEOP) Framework. A method is proposed to enable organisations to effectively evaluate each of the components using a rating system. The framework and rating tool can be used to improve the effectiveness of policy development. A preliminary validation of the instrument indicated that the rating system can assist users with identifying and understanding policy strengths and weaknesses. © 2013 Mohd Heikal Husin, Nina Evans and Gaye Deegan.","Knowledge management; Policy; Policy rating; Social media; Web 2.0","Human resource management; Knowledge management; Public policy; Rating; Social networking (online); Key Issues; Policy development; Public sector; Rating system; Senior managers; Social media; Support knowledge; Web 2.0; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Alexander P., Social Media 101: A beginner's guide for Finance employees, (2010); Bailey J.E., Pearson S.W., Development of a Tool for Measuring and Analyzing Computer User Satisfaction, Management Science, 29, pp. 530-545, (1983); Bertot J.C., Jaeger P.T., Grimes J.M., Promoting transparency and accountability through ICTs, social media, and collaborative e-government, Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, 1, 6, pp. 78-91, (2012); David J., Policy enforcement in the workplace, Computers & Security, 21, pp. 506-513, (2002); Inc D., Dell's Global Social Media Policy, (2011); Deloitte, Deloitte LLP 2009 Ethics and Workplace Survey results: Social networking and reputational risk in the workplace, (2009); De Meyer A., Loh C., Impact of information and communications technologies on government innovation policy: An international comparison, International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management, 1, 2, pp. 1-29, (2004); Doherty N.F., Anastasakis L., Fulford H., Reinforcing the security of corporate information resources: A critical review of the role of the acceptable use policy, International Journal of Information Management, (2010); Fenwick N., Condon C., Leaver S., Spiver Overby C., Worthington B., The CIO's guide to establishing a social media policy, (2010); Flynn N., The e-policy handbook: Rules and best practices to safely manage your company's e-mail, blogs, Social networking, and other electronic communication tools, (2009); Hale D., Just What is a Policy, Anyway?

Making smart data-driven decisions will help the organizations to ride the waves toward invaluable investments. The successful implementation of Big Data projects depends on their alignment with the current organizational, technological, and analytical aspects. Identifying the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for Big Data is fundamental to overcome the challenges surrounding Big Data Analytics (BDA) and implementation. In recent years, the investigations related to identifying the CSFs of Big Data and Big Data Analytics expanded on a large scale trying to address the limitations in existing publications and contribute to the body of knowledge. This paper aims to provide more understanding about the existing CSFs for Big Data Analytics and implementation and contributes to the body of knowledge by answering three research questions: 1) How many studies have investigated on Big Data CSFs for analytics and implementation?, 2) What are the existing CSFs for Big Data Analytics, and 3) What are the categories of Big Data Analytics CSFs?. By conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for the available studies related to Big Data CSFs in the last twelve years (2007-2019), a final list of sixteen (16) related articles was extracted and analyzed to identify the Big Data Analytics CSFs and their categories. Based on the descriptive qualitative content analysis method for the selected literature, this SLR paper identifies 74 CSFs for Big Data and proposes a classification schema and framework in terms of 5 categories, namely Organization, Technology, People, Data Management, and Governance. The findings of this paper could be used as a referential framework for a successful strategy and implementation of Big Data by formulating more effective data-driven decisions. Future work will investigate the priority of the Big Data CSFs and their categories toward developing a conceptual framework for assessing the success of Big Data projects.  © 2013 IEEE.","Big data (BD); big data analytics (BDA); big data challenges; big data implementation; critical success factors (CSFs); information system success; maturity; readiness; systematic literature review (SLR)","Big data; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Information management; Metadata; Conceptual frameworks; Content analysis method; Critical success factor; Data driven decision; Digital transformation; Research questions; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Advanced Analytics","","","","","","","Jin X., Wah B.W., Cheng X., Wang Y., Significance and challenges of big data research, Big Data Res., 2, 2, pp. 59-64, (2015); Tsai C.-W., Lai C.-F., Chao H.-C., Vasilakos A.V., Big data analytics: A survey, J.

Regrettably, most universities and establishments in developing countries and beyond do not have learning contents that are compatible with the mobile devices. This makes the development of mobile learning contents difficult and therefore the practice of reusing online Learning Objects (LO), is generally employed to make the development of the mobile learning contents much easier. The major issues encountered with semantic web at times of processing RLO, are that first, not all online LO are accessible on mobile devices, subsequently the LO metadata are not readily available. The Mobile Learning Objects Compilation Framework (MLOC) which is a mixture framework of random forest and semantic web is proposed by this study to address these problems. The hybrid framework would include a method that will generate RLO metadata from repositories and use those metadata to evaluate the RLO. The assembled related RLO are made available to these learning contents to other systems through the web services so that mobile apps can access the RLO easily. This research therefore examines the methods to enhance semantic web in the reuse of LO for mobile devices. The research will first introduce a method to generate learning metadata from public search results based on learning theories. Thereafter, establish the semantic methods to evaluate the RLO and assemble RLO into complete learning units in a repository that can be accessed by mobile devices without hitches The projected framework would be able to search and extract the RLOs which are much more effectual compared to RLOs retrieved by other related mobile apps which in turn confirms that MLOC can be used to process RLOs for mobile devices. © 2020 SERSC.","Lecturers; MLOC; Mobile Learning; RLO","","","","","","Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education","The authors would like to acknowledge the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education Under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) 2018, with account number 203.PKOMP.6711580.","Allen M.W., Michael Allen's guide to e-learning: Building interactive, fun, And Effective Learning Programs for Any Company: John Wiley & Sons, (2016); Bhalalusesa R.P., Arshad M.R.M., Using Search Results Metadata to Discover Effective Learning Objects for Mobile Devices, (2014); Cardinaels K., A Dynamic Learning Object Life Cycle and Its Implications for Automatic Metadata Generation, (2007); Caruana R., Niculescu-Mizil A., An empirical comparison of supervised learning algorithms, Paper Presented at the Proceedings of the 23Rd International Conference on Machine Learning, (2006); Csete J., Wong Y.-H., Vogel D., Mobile Devices in and out of the Classroom.
