There are five principal variants related to CD: incremental, gradual, recurrent, sudden, and blip. Genetic programming combiner (GPC) classification is an effective core candidate for data stream classification for IDS. However, its basic structure relies on the usage of traditional static machine learning models that receive onetime training, limiting its ability to handle CD. To address this issue, we propose an extended variant of the GPC using three main components. First, we replace existing classifiers with alternatives: online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM), feature adaptive OSELM (FA-OSELM), and knowledge preservation OSELM (KP-OSELM). Second, we add two new components to the GPC, specifically, a data balancing and a classifier update. Third, the coordination between the sub-models produces three novel variants of the GPC: GPC-KOS for KA-OSELM; GPC-FOS for FA-OSELM; and GPC-OS for OSELM. This article presents the first data stream-based classification framework that provides novel strategies for handling CD variants. The experimental results demonstrate that both GPC-KOS and GPC-FOS outperform the traditional GPC and other state-of-the-art methods, and the transfer learning and memory features contribute to the effective handling of most types of CD. Moreover, the application of our incremental variants on real-world datasets (KDD Cup ‘99, CICIDS-2017, CSE-CIC-IDS-2018, and ISCX ‘12) demonstrate improved performance (GPC-FOS in connection with CSE-CIC-IDS-2018 and CICIDS-2017; GPC-KOS in connection with ISCX2012 and KDD Cup ‘99), with maximum accuracy rates of 100% and 98% by GPC-KOS and GPC-FOS, respectively. Additionally, our GPC variants do not show superior performance in handling blip drift. © 2023 by the authors.","concept drift; genetic programming combiner; incremental learning; intrusion detection; stream data classification; transfer learning","Balancing; Classification (of information); Genetic algorithms; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Concept drifts; Data stream classifications; Genetic programming combiner; Incremental learning; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Online sequential extreme learning machine; Performance; Stream data classifications; Transfer learning; article; classifier; data classification; learning; machine learning; memory; transfer of learning; Genetic programming","","","","","","","Yazdi H.S., Bafghi A.G., A drift aware adaptive method based on minimum uncertainty for anomaly detection in social networking, Expert Syst.

The performance of processing structured data through a relational database has become incompatible with big data challenges. Nowadays, there is a need to deal with semi-structured data with a flexible schema for different applications. Not only SQL (NoSQL) has been presented to overcome the limitations of relational databases in terms of scale, performance, data model, and distribution system. Also, NoSQL supports semi-structured data and can handle a huge amount of data and provide flexibility in the data schema. But the data models of NoSQL systems are very complex, as there are no tools available to represent a scheme for NoSQL databases. In addition, there is no standard schema for data modelling of document-oriented databases. This study proposes a semi-structured data model for big data (SS-DMBD) that is compatible with a document-oriented database, and also proposes an algorithm for mapping the entity relationship (ER) model to SS-DMBD. A case study is used to evaluate the SS-DMBD and its features. The results show that this model can address most features of semi-structured data.

It becomes more demanding with limited samples but with a massive number of features (high dimensionality). The high dimensional and imbalanced data set has posed severe challenges in many real-world applications, such as biomedical data sets. Numerous researchers investigated either imbalanced class or high dimensional data sets and came up with various methods. Nonetheless, few approaches reported in the literature have addressed the intersection of the high dimensional and imbalanced class problem due to their complicated interactions. Lately, feature selection has become a well-known technique that has been used to overcome this problem by selecting discriminative features that represent minority and majority class. This paper proposes a new method called Robust Correlation Based Redundancy and Binary Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (rCBR-BGOA); rCBR-BGOA has employed an ensemble of multi-filters coupled with the Correlation-Based Redundancy method to select optimal feature subsets. A binary Grasshopper optimisation algorithm (BGOA) is used to construct the feature selection process as an optimisation problem to select the best (near-optimal) combination of features from the majority and minority class. The obtained results, supported by the proper statistical analysis, indicate that rCBR-BGOA can improve the classification performance for high dimensional and imbalanced datasets in terms of G-mean and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) performance metrics.","class-imbalanced dataset; Grasshopper optimisation algorithm; high dimensionality; multi-filter","Animals; Data Accuracy; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Databases, Genetic; Genomics; Humans; Machine Learning; animal; genetic database; genomics; human; machine learning; measurement accuracy; procedures; statistical analysis","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","20734425","","","32605144","English","Genes (Basel)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087396158"

This paper aims to develop a predictive model for suicide attempts among patients with depression using machine learning algorithms as well as presents a comparative study on single predictive models with ensemble predictive models for differentiating depressed patients with suicide attempts from non-suicide attempters. We applied and trained eight different machine learning algorithms using a dataset that consists of 75 patients diagnosed with a depressive disorder. A recursive feature elimination was used to reduce the features via three-fold cross validation. An ensemble predictive models outperformed the single predictive models. Voting and bagging revealed the highest accuracy of 92% compared to other machine learning algorithms. Our findings indicate that history of suicide attempt, religion, race, suicide ideation and severity of clinical depression are useful factors for prediction of suicide attempts. © The Author(s) 2021.","data mining;

This study proposed a new hybrid string matching algorithm called AbdulRazzaq. This algorithm consisted of a combination between the new searching technique and selecting the good features from two original algorithms, namely, Smith and Karp–Rabin. The proposed algorithm showed lower number of attempts and character comparisons than those of the original algorithms and common algorithms in the string matching field. Abdul Razzaq algorithm used six types of databases, namely, DNA, Protein, XML, Pitch, English, and Source. The best database regarding the number of attempts of AbdulRazzaq algorithm was Pitch, whereas DNA was the worst.

Watermarking techniques are used for many applications such as ownership protection, which is a popular area of research as compared to others such as authentication and local temper localization. There are many image watermarking schemes that have been recently published based on the frequency domain as it can fulfill watermarking requirements such as high robustness and imperceptibility. Singular-value decomposition (SVD) is one of them and is used in many frequency transform-based image watermarking schemes due to its stability and mathematical simplicity. However, there are many schemes that lack robustness against malicious cyberattacks, whereby the watermarks are easy to detect and destroy. Consequently, the proposed watermarking schemes became more complicated and cannot resist various geometric and non-geometric attacks. Thus, there are many existing hybrid SVD-based image watermarking schemes found be insecure. As there is also a lack of in-depth reviews in this domain, the focus of this paper is the analysis of the state-of-the-art in hybrid SVD-based image watermarking. We perform efficiency comparisons to highlight various security problems, open issues, and research gaps. Based on our findings, we additionally provide some recommendations for the development of more robust schemes in the future. This paper provides essential information for researchers and practitioners alike to advance the field of image watermarking.  © 2013 IEEE.","Embedding; extraction; frequency domain; image watermarking; singular-value decomposition (SVD)","Frequency domain analysis; Mathematical transformations; Security of data; Singular value decomposition; Watermarking; Efficiency comparisons; Frequency domains; Frequency transform; Geometric attacks; Security problems; State of the art; Watermarking algorithms; Watermarking schemes; Image watermarking","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8014074)","This work was supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia, and in part by the Research University Grant under Grant 1001/PKOMP/8014074.","Singh A.K., Some New Techniques of Improved Wavelet Domain Watermarking OFR Medical Images, (2015); Singh P., Chadha R.S., A survey of digital watermarking techniques, applications and attacks, Int.

This requires a personalized information delivery, which will effectively fix the problem. The process of personalizing information requires several major steps: (i) determine the attributes which will be used to interpret a person, (ii) selects an algorithm which will accurately and efficiently classify the person according to the retrieved background information, and (iii) recommends the correct information to rectify the particular misunderstanding. This research paper considers the first two steps. First, data regarding the knowledge, attitudes and prevention practices are determined from the established literature where some variables give a significant impact on the predictive model. In the second step, five performed machine learning algorithms were tested for the classification task. The result indicates that the use of support vector machine and decision tree algorithms provide the best performance in classifying the person’s understanding regarding the dengue fever. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This algorithm depended on good features; searching and shifting techniques in the Atheer and Berry-Ravindran algorithms, respectively. The proposed algorithm showed better performance in number of attempts and character comparisons compared to the original and recent and standard algorithms. E-Atheer algorithm used several types of databases, which are DNA, Protein, XML, Pitch, English, and Source. The best performancein the number of attempts is when the algorithm is executed using the pitch dataset. The worst performance is when it is used with DNA dataset. The best and worst databases in the number of character comparisons with the E-Atheer algorithm are the Source and DNA databases, respectively.

Our main research is to develop a tool which can be used to access and manipulate protein information from difference databases. In our approach, we have integrated difference databases such as Swiss-prot, PDB, Interpro, and EMBL and transformed these databases in flat file format into relational form using XML and Bioperl. As a result, we showed this tool can search different sizes of protein information stored in relational database and the result can be retrieved faster compared to flat file database.

Most studies mention that a relational database cannot handle big data. This challenge has led to the presentation of the not only structured query language (NoSQL) database as a new concept of database technology. NoSQL supports large volumes of data by providing a mechanism for data storage, retrieval and more flexible than a relational database. One of the most powerful types of NoSQL database is the document-oriented database. Recently, many software developers are willing to migrate from using relational databases to NoSQL database because of scalability, availability, and performance. The document-oriented database has challenged as to how to obtain an appropriate schema for the document-oriented database. The existing approach to migrate a relational database to a document-oriented database does not consider all the properties of the former, especially on how to handle various types of relationships. This research proposed a flexible schema for a document-oriented database (SDOD). This study evaluated the development of agility based on the schema of a document-oriented database and query execution time. The evaluation verifies the reliability of the proposed schema.

It is possible to see application of large number of RFID readers to perform authentication process with RFID tag at the same time in RFID system. If there is an improper channel access algorithm implemented on RFID reader, it will cause readers-to-tag collision in RFID system. In order to resolve this issue, a proper timing of channel access on RFID tag should be estimated to avoid collision between RFID readers. In our proposed work, flowgraph model is recommended to be used as theoretical method for estimating over the air specific RFID protocol execution time required by different number of RFID readers and RFID tag in same zone. At the same time, we suggest that transmission channel access hold off time of each interfered RFID reader should take into consideration in order to avoid collision between RFID readers and tag. The transmission channel access hold off time of each interfered RFID reader is proportional with specific RFID protocol execution time for single authentication event involving a RFID reader and a RFID tag. With our proposed general function, it helps to provide reliability over the air specific RFID protocol execution time involving different number of RFID readers and tag in same zone. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Flowgraph model; Radio frequency identification(RFID); Readers-to-tag collision; Specific RFID protocol execution time","Authentication; Collision avoidance; Graphic methods; Anti collision; Channel access; Channel access algorithms; General functions; RFID protocols; Tag collision; Theoretical methods; Transmission channels; Radio frequency identification (RFID)","","","","","","","Li T., Chen S., Ling Y., Identifying the missing tags in a large rfid system, Proc.

Studies show that existing works handled only one or two programming languages. They are web-based platform, using marking scheme and strategy, are embedded in the learning management system and provides graphics user interface. This paper presents a proposed framework of an Automatic Assessment System for learning object oriented programming language. We initiate the research by first conducting survey, which investigates the needs of the system in the department. The survey was conducted on two main groups, which are the first year programming students and the lecturers who have experience in teaching programming. The results from the survey show that the Assessment system can help students in learning programming language as well as reduce the lecturers’ workload. We proposed a framework for Automatic Assessment system, which consists of five modules. The modules are teaching module to help students learn and submit program code; real time detector module to show existing error and supply hints to solve problem; marking module to compile, mark, execute, and pre-set evaluation criteria; analysis and reporting module to give instant feedback and social module for interactions between the users. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Automatic assessment; Feedback; One-to-one tutor; Programming; Web application","Computational linguistics; Computer programming languages; Education; Feedback; Graphical user interfaces; Mathematical programming; Students; Surveys; Teaching; User interfaces; Automatic assessment; Evaluation criteria; First year programming; Learning management system; Learning programming; One-to-one tutor; Teaching programming; WEB application; Object oriented programming","","","","","","","Blumenstein M., Green S., Nguyen A., Muthukkumarasamy V., GAME: A Generic automated marking environment for programming assessment, Proceedings of International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing 2004, ITCC 2004, 1, (2004); Douce C., Livingstone D., Orwell J., Automatic test-based assessment of programming: A review, J.

One cannot simply adopt any MBD outbreak prediction system to their study area due to specific issues such as insufficient data and the arduousness of obtaining particular datasets. Manipulating open-source data available from the Internet might be scarce, unstructured, inadequate, irrelevant, and could merely be noise. Hence, the machine learning predictive power will be affected directly.

The traditional way to identify learning styles is through a questionnaire or survey. Despite being reliable these instruments have several shortcomings that hinder the learning style identification such as students are unmotivated to fill out a questionnaire and reluctant to provide information. Thus, to solve these problems, researchers have proposed several approaches to automatically detect learning styles. The automatic detection of learning styles is proven to be beneficial to students as it can supply them with learning materials according to their individual preferences. In this study we propose a hybrid approach that combines fuzzy logic and case-based reasoning method to classify students according to their learning styles and preferences. In the context of modeling the learning styles, a student model will be constructed based on the information of student's performance during the online course, personality and their gender. Within this study, we intend to outline our proposed model following the felder-silverman model of learning styles and the Big Five model of personality. © Medwell Journals, 2018.","Case-based reasoning; Classification; Fuzzy logic; Learning style; Personality; Students","","","","","","","","Abrahamian E., Weinberg J., Grady M., Stanton C.M., The effect of personality-aware computer-human interfaces on learning, J.

However, those proposed models have difficulty interpreting and understanding why an individual has suicidal attempts. To overcome this issue, the identification of features such as risk factors in predicting suicide attempts is important for clinicians to make decisions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to propose an explainable predictive model to predict and analyse the importance of features for suicide attempts. This model can also provide explanations to improve the clinical understanding of suicide attempts. Two complex ensemble learning models, namely Random Forest and Gradient Boosting with an explanatory model (SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)) have been constructed. The models are used for predictive interpretation and understanding of the importance of the features. The experiment shows that both models with SHAP are able to interpret and understand the nature of an individual's predictions with suicide attempts. However, compared with Random Forest, the results show that Gradient Boosting with SHAP achieves higher accuracy and the analyses found that history of suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and ethnicity as the main predictors for suicide attempts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Ensemble learning; Explainable AI; Predictive model; SHAP; Suicide attempt risk","Ethnicity; Humans; Machine Learning; Risk Factors; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; adult; aged; alcoholism; anxiety; anxiety disorder; area under the curve; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; clinician; controlled study; cross validation; decision making; depression; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; drug dependence; DSM-IV; female; hospitalization; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mental disease assessment; prediction; predictive model; probability; random forest; recall; risk factor; Scale for Suicidal Ideation; sensitivity and specificity; shapley additive explanations approach; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; ethnicity; machine learning","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/ICT02/USM/02/5)","This work has been supported by Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) with Project Code: FRGS/1/2020/ICT02/USM/02/5 .

Currently, the number of active cases in Malaysia is less than 50% of the accumulated points. This paper will present the most accurate machine learning model to predict the number of new possibilities for 01/04-15/04/2020 (15 days). Notably, four machine learning models and one traditional statistical prediction analysis ARIMA have been trained, tested and evaluated. The results are compared to the actual data. We found that the multilayer perceptron neural network has outperformed all models in estimating the number of new positive cases in a specific time range. However, the ARIMA model performs better in predicting recovered and death cases than the machine learning models. We have applied the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute predictive error (MAPE) evaluation metrics to assess the model performance. The proposed approach can be viewed as a feasible alternative to forecast the new COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, where there is no constant seasonal trend and no past data sources for comparison. The proposed methodology is easily tractable and computationally efficient to demonstrate the number of new cases that are useful and beneficial in terms of control management. © 2021 IEEE.","ARIMA; Machine learning; Neural network; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Time-series prediction","Autoregressive moving average model; Forecasting; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Predictive analytics; Computationally efficient; Control management; Evaluation metrics; Feasible alternatives; Machine learning models; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Root mean square errors; Statistical prediction; Machine learning","","","","","University of Southern Maine, USM","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors appreciate all emergency services personnel, nurses, doctors, and other hospital staff for their efforts in combating the COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia.

A clinical decision support system (CDSS) helps medical experts in their daily work and supports them in effective decision-making. The huge amount of medical information and the complex correlation between the risk factors and the level of risk for suicidal behavior makes the representation of data is challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes an ontology-based modeling to classify an individual with at-risk of suicidal behavior for effective clinical decision support system. The case study is conducted to evaluate the ontology model and provides a general approach to knowledge sharing and reusing knowledge for suicide risk prevention and management. The finding shows that the ontology model can be used as a knowledge base for classification, and it is suitable to capture medical knowledge, detailed concepts, and relationships in a formal way using Web Ontology Language (OWL). The results of the proposed ontology model in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity are 83%, 84%, and 82% respectively. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Clinical Decision Support System; Data Mining; Knowledge Base; Ontological Model; Suicidal Behavior","Decision making; Decision support systems; Knowledge based systems; Ontology; Clinical decision support systems; Complex problems; Decisions makings; Knowledge base; Medical experts; Medical information; Ontological modeling; Ontology based modeling; Ontology model; Suicidal behavior; Data mining","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/ICT02/USM/02/5); Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","The authors would like to thank all parties that support and involve directly or indirectly into this research, especially Universiti Sains Malaysia, Pulau Pinang and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur.

In this paper, we focus on high-dimensional multi-class imbalanced problems. The high dimensional and multi-class imbalanced problem has posed acute challenges for the conventional classifiers to effectively perform classification tasks on both the minority and majority classes. Numerous efforts have been devoted to addressing either high dimensionality dataset or class imbalance problems. Nonetheless, few methods have been proposed to address the intersection of multi-class imbalanced and high-dimensional problems concurrently due to their intricate interactions. This paper presents novel hybrid algorithms for feature selection with the high dimensional multi-class imbalanced problem using multiple filter-based rankers (MFR) and hybrid Grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA). The Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is incorporated into GOA. SA is used to enhance the best solution found by the GOA algorithm. The aim of using the SA here is to tackle the slow convergence and improve the exploitation by searching the high-quality regions found by the GOA. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving the classification performance in terms of area under the curve (AUC) compared to other well-known methods, which guarantees the ability of the proposed methods in searching the feature space and identifying very robust and discriminative features that best predict the minority class.  © 2013 IEEE.","feature selection; Grasshopper optimization algorithm; high-dimensionality; hybrid filter-wrapper; imbalanced class distribution; multiple filter-based rankers; simulated annealing; tournament selection","Simulated annealing; Area under the curves; Class imbalance problems; Classification performance; Conventional classifier; Discriminative features; High-dimensional problems; Optimization algorithms; Simulated annealing algorithms; Feature extraction","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/8014084)","This work was supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia under Grant 1001/PKOMP/8014084.","Sharifai A.G., Zainol Z., The correlation-based redundancy multiple-filter approach for gene selection, Int.

Various methods have been proposed for gene selection; however, most existing methods predominantly focused on selecting relevant gene subsets. However, the selected genes often comprised redundant genes in the training data, which may reduce the performance and increase the complexity of the learning algorithm. This paper proposes a Correlation-Based Redundancy Multiple Filter Approach (CBRMFA). Three filter methods are employed to select the relevant genes with diverse classification ability. The top N ranking genes with the highest-ranking scores are combined to form a new ranking list. The Correlation-Based Redundancy is utilised to eliminate redundant genes. A wrapper approach, sequential forward search approach is used to select the optimal gene subsets. Experimental results show that our proposed CBRMFA had achieved outstanding results in terms of three performance measures compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Correlation-based redundancy;

For the millions of people who suffer from hearing loss around the world, interaction with people who have the ability to hear and do not suffer from hearing impairment or loss is considered as complicated. In line with this issue, technology is perceived as a crucial factor in being an enabler of providing solutions to enhance the quality of life of the hearing impairment by increasing accessibility. This research aims to review and analyze articles related to sign language recognition based on the sensor-based glove system, in order to identify academic motivations, challenges, and recommendations related to this field. The search for the relevant review materials and articles was performed on four major databases ranging from 2017 to 2022: Science Direct, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus. The articles were chosen based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The literature findings of this paper indicate the dataset size to be open issues and challenges for hand gesture recognition. Furthermore, the majority of research on sign language recognition based on data glove was performed on static, single hand, and isolated gestures. Moreover, recognition accuracy typically achieved results higher than 90%. However, most experiments were carried out with a limited number of gestures. Overall, it is hoped that this study will serve as a roadmap for future research and raise awareness among researchers in the field of sign language recognition.  © 2013 IEEE.","Gesture recognition; glove; man-machine interface; pattern recognition; sensor; sign language","Audition; Human computer interaction; Palmprint recognition; Assistive technology; Auditory systems; Gestures recognition; Glove; Man-machine interface; Manual; Sign language; Sign Language recognition; Systematic; Gesture recognition","","","","","","","Cheok M.J., Omar Z., Jaward M.H., A review of hand gesture and sign language recognition techniques, Int.

Learning styles are identified to help educators understand how students learn and to help students become more self-Aware of their learning strengths and weaknesses. Students, on the other hand, are unaware of their learning patterns and preferences. The traditional method of determining learning styles has been characterized as a questionnaire-based approach. However, it has various flaws that prohibit learning style identification, such as students' lack of motivation to complete a questionnaire, their reluctance to offer information, and the questionnaire's measurement of learning styles is limited to a single point in time. As a result, an automated approach for automatically detecting students' learning styles has been proposed to overcome these restrictions. The goal of this research is to give a review of existing research in the field of learning styles detection. A total of 36 papers were considered in the study, which was published between 2010 and 2020. Thus, this research highlights the review's findings, which are likely to assist researchers and practitioners in better understanding the theoretical and technical challenges surrounding automatic detection of learning styles. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Data Science; Students; Surveys; Automated approach; Automatic Detection; Data-driven approach; Learning patterns; Learning Style; Self-aware; Single point; Technical challenges; Intelligent computing","","","","","","","Litzinger T A, Lee S H, Wise J C, A study of the reliability and validity of the Felder-Soloman Index of Learning Styles Proceedings of the 2005 American Society for Education Annual Conference & Exposition, pp. 1-16, (2005); Felder R M, Silverman L, Learning and teaching styles in engineering education, Engineering Education, 78, pp. 674-681, (1988); Feldman J, Monteserin A, Amandi A, Automatic detection of learning styles : state of the art, Artificial Intelligence Review, 44, pp. 157-186, (2015); Felder R M, Soloman B A, Index of Learning Styles Questionnaire, (2005); Kolb A Y, Kolb D A, The Kolb Learning Style Inventory-Version 3.1, Technical Specification, (2005); Honey P, Mumford A, The Learning Styles Questionnaire: 80-item version, (2006); Fleming N D, Mills C, Not another inventory, rather a catalyst for reflection, To Improve the Academy, 11, (1992); Mokhtar R, Nor Azan M Z, Siti Norul Huda S A, Rule-based knowledge representation for modality learning style in aiwbes, Knowledge Management International Conference, 1, pp. 614-617, (2010); Stieger S, Reips U-D, What are participants doing while filling in an online questionnaire: A paradata collection tool and an empirical study, Computers in Human Behavior, 26, pp. 1488-1495, (2010); Akbulut Y, Cardak C S, Computers & Education Adaptive educational hypermedia accommodating learning styles: A content analysis of publications from 2000 to 2011, Computers & Education, 58, pp. 835-842, (2012); Conati C, Bayesian Student Modeling, Studies in Computational Intelligence Advances in Intelligent Tutoring Systems, 308, pp. 281-299, (2010); Chrysafiadi K, Maria V, Student modeling approaches: A literature review for the last decade, Expert Systems with Applications, 40, pp. 4715-4729, (2013); Schiaffino S, Garcia P, Amandi A, eTeacher: Providing personalized assistance to elearning students, Computers and Education, 51, pp. 1744-1754, (2008); Ahmad N B, Shamsuddin S, Abraham A, Computational Intelligence for Tech, pp. 99-124, (2010); Alkhuraiji S, Cheetham B, Bamasak O, Dynamic Adaptive Mechanism in Learning Management System Based on Learning Styles, 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, pp. 215-217, (2011); El Bachari E, El Hassan Abelwahed M E A, E-Learning Personalization Based On Dynamic Learners, Preference International Journal of Computer Science & Information Technology Citeseer, 3, pp. 200-216, (2011); Saberi N, Montazer G, A New Approach for Learners' Modeling in E-Learning Environment Using LMS logs Analysis, 2012 Third International Conference on E-Learning and E-Teaching (Icelet), pp. 25-33, (2012); Permanasari A E, Hidayah I, Nugraha S, A student modeling based on bayesian network framework for characterizing student learning style, Advanced Science Letters, 20, pp. 1936-1940, (2014); Rajper S, Shaikh N, Shaikh Z, Mallah G A, Automatic detection of learning styles on learning management systems using data mining technique, Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 9, pp. 1-5, (2016); Sahid D S S, Nugroho L E, Santosa P I, Integrated Stochastic and Literate Based Driven Approaches in Learning Style Identification for Personalized E-Learning Purpose, International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology, 7, pp. 1708-1715, (2017); Li L X, Abdul Rahman S S, Students' learning style detection using tree augmented naive Bayes, Royal Society open science, 5, pp. 1-13, (2018); Hidayat N, Wardoyo R, Azhari S, Surjono H D, Enhanced Performance of the Automatic Learning Style Detection Model using a Combination of Modified K-Means Algorithm and Naive Bayesian, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 11, pp. 638-648, (2020); Chandra B, Varghese P P, Moving towards efficient decision tree construction, Inf.

SCA is an enhancement of work in [1] where they used Apriori algorithm to generate the rule. In our approach we used matrix structure to represent data in a database. We implement SCA using Java programming language on 1.4 GHz Pentium 4 PC machine.

The existence of many Arabic language centers provides the help needed for this Muslims. However for fulltime working adults, these facilities did not cater for their unpredictable free time. This paper describes a framework for Collaborative Online Arabic Learning software towards understanding Quran (COAL-UQ). The objectives of COAL-UQ are to provide users an online tools for learning Arabic anytime and anywhere, to ease the non-Arabic speakers in understanding the messages and meanings of the Quran and to exploit existing learning tools for learning a new language. We implement the Think-Pair-Share method introduced by Lyman in 1981 in the collaborative software. The software also integrates other online learning tools and utilizes the tools to realize the Think-Pair-Share method.

Several machine learning models are being developed to generate accurate predictions in a suicide attempt. However, there is a lack of interpretability, explainability and transparency with these predictive models. Therefore, the aim of this study is to improve explanations of machine learning models for predicting suicidal behavior based on clinical data using the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach. The experiment shows that machine learning models with SHAP are able to interpret and understand the nature of an individual's predictions of suicidal behavior.  © 2022 ACM.","Data Mining; Explainable AI; Machine Learning; Prediction Model; Suicidal Behavior","Data mining; Decision making; Forecasting; Accurate prediction; Behavior prediction; Clinical decision making; Explainable AI; Interpretability; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Shapley; Suicidal behavior; Machine learning","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/ICT02/USM/02/5)","The authors would like to thank all parties that support and involve directly or indirectly into this research, especially Universiti Sains Malaysia, Pulau Pinang and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur.

In conjunction with recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence, there is increasing research into how machine learning can assist in the detection, prediction and treatment of suicidal behaviour. Therefore, this study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the literature exploring machine learning techniques in the study of suicidal behaviour prediction. Methods: A search of four databases was conducted: Web of Science, PubMed, Dimensions, and Scopus for research papers dated between January 2016 and September 2021. The search keywords are ‘data mining’, ‘machine learning’ in combination with ‘suicidal behaviour’, ‘suicide’, ‘suicide attempt’, ‘suicidal ideation’, ‘suicide plan’ and ‘self-harm’. The studies that used machine learning techniques were synthesized according to the countries of the articles, sample description, sample size, classification tasks, number of features used to develop the models, types of machine learning techniques, and evaluation of performance metrics. Results: Thirty-five empirical articles met the criteria to be included in the current review. We provide a general overview of machine learning techniques, examine the feature categories, describe methodological challenges, and suggest areas for improvement and research directions. Ensemble prediction models have been shown to be more accurate and useful than single prediction models. Conclusions: Machine learning has great potential for improving estimates of future suicidal behaviour and monitoring changes in risk over time. Further research can address important challenges and potential opportunities that may contribute to significant advances in suicide prediction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Data mining; Machine learning; Prediction model; Suicidal behaviour","Artificial Intelligence; Data Mining; Humans; Machine Learning; Suicidal Ideation; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; neuroleptic agent; Behavior prediction; Key factors; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Research papers; Search keyword; Suicidal behavior; Systematic Review; Web of Science; alcoholism; artificial neural network; automutilation; Bayes theorem; Bayesian learning; Bayesian network; bootstrapping; computer prediction; data mining; decision tree; deep neural network; educational status; employment status; externalizing disorder; family history; female; groups by age; human; internalizing disorder; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; leave one out cross validation; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; male; physical disease; postnatal depression; predictive model; probability theory; random forest; relevance vector machine; Review; ridge regression; risk factor; schizophrenia; sex difference; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide; suicide attempt; support vector machine; systematic review; artificial intelligence; machine learning; suicidal ideation; Data mining","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/ICT02/USM/02/5); Universiti Sains Malaysia","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank all parties that support and involve directly or indirectly into this research, especially Universiti Sains Malaysia, Pulau Pinang and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur.

However, SVD-based image watermarking schemes suffer from some drawbacks such as the false positive problem (FPP), and an undesirable trade-off between vital properties such as imperceptibility, embedding capacity, and robustness. To address these drawbacks, we improve upon the SVD-based color image watermarking by incorporating integer wavelet transform (IWT) and chaotic maps. A grayscale image watermark is decomposed into eight gray levels (bit-planes) before being encrypted and re-ordered by a chaotic sequence. Each encrypted bit-plane is inserted into singular values of the sub-bands of a host image. The embedding process is controlled by chaos-based multiple scaling factors (MSF) which are updated in each embedded bit-plane. The resulting values are involved in generating a hash value at the end of the embedding processes. The hash value is used to overcome FPP issues and improves security. Our findings illustrate the proposed scheme's robustness, security, imperceptibility, and capacity. It also exhibits excellent robustness against attacks and its performance surpasses a variety of existing schemes. In addition, the proposed scheme is hypersensitive to even the slightest secret key variations. © 2021 THE AUTHORS","Chaotic map; Image watermark; Integer wavelet transform; IWT; Singular value decomposition SVD","Chaotic systems; Cryptography; Economic and social effects; Image enhancement; Image watermarking; Process control; Watermarking; Wavelet decomposition; Bit planes; Chaotic map; Embedding process; False positive; Hash value; Image watermark; Integer wavelet transforms; Singular value decomposition singular value decomposition; Watermarking schemes; Singular value decomposition","","","","","","","Kumar C., Singh A.K., Kumar P., A recent survey on image watermarking techniques and its application in e-governance, Multimedia Tools Appl., 77, 3, pp. 3597-3622, (2018); Pan J.-S., Huang H.-C., Jain L.C., Intelligent Watermarking Techniques, 7, (2004); Huang H.-C., Information Hiding and Applications, 227, (2009); Bal S.N., Nayak M.R., Sarkar S.K., On the implementation of a secured watermarking mechanism based on cryptography and bit pairs matching, J.

In our proposed work, flowgraph model is recommended to use with saddlepoint approximation to estimate total time required by a RFID reader to complete its authentication task. In real world applications of RFID system, server is required to handle multiple RFID readers at the same time in order to have better coverage area of receiving data. Thus, each RFID reader accessed time to server should be limited to certain of time else it will cause network congestion on server. By knowing actual total time required by a single RFID reader to complete its authentication task with specific number of existence RFID tags, administrator can configure on server when it should terminate verification process and start new authentication event with other RFID readers. This will help server to automatically establish a new communication event with other RFID readers when there is no response from existing RFID reader after certain of time. The data analysis model which we have used to represent each task of authentication process in RFID system is known as semi-Markov model. Based on the flowgraph models presented on our paper, information such as moment generating function for each authentication process in RFID system and probability of transition to next authentication task in RFID system are available. © 2013 The Franklin Institute.

However, most people with depression are not aware, untreated, and misdiagnosed. The presence of semantic inconsistencies in the knowledge-based system and limited symptoms in representing the depression domain knowledge due to varying from one person to one person lead to a major challenge in diagnosing depression. This paper proposes an ontology-based approach for depression diagnosis by collecting and studying depression knowledge of subjects for further diagnosis. All concepts and relationships detailed are applied using Web Ontology Language (OWL). The findings show that the proposed model can identify an individual with depression with 80% accuracy, 70% specificity, and 90% sensitivity. The proposed model can be used as a reference diagnosis model and the classification of an individual with depression will be improved by adding the information on risk factors that affect depression for further analysis. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

This study proposes a data-driven approach that allows for rock mass classification. Two machine learning (ML) classification models, namely random forest (RF) and extremely randomized tree (ERT), are employed to classify the rock mass conditions encountered in the Pahang-Selangor Raw Water Tunnel in Malaysia using tunnel boring machine (TBM) operating parameters. Due to imbalance of rock classes distribution, an oversampling technique was used to obtain a balanced training dataset for unbiased learning of the ML models. A five-fold cross-validation approach was used to tune the model hyperparameters and validation-set approach was used for the model evalua-tion. ERT achieved an overall accuracy of 95%, while RF achieved 94% accuracy, in rightly classifying rock mass conditions. The result shows that the proposed approach has the potential to identify and correctly classify ground conditions of a TBM, which allows for early problem detection and on-the-fly support system selection based on the identified ground condition. This study, which is part of an ongoing effort towards developing reliable models that could be incorporated into TBMs, shows the potential of data-driven approaches for on-the-fly classification of ground conditions ahead of a TBM and could allow for the early detection of potential construction problems. © 2021 by the authors.

The management of a semi-structured data format for big data is an important concern that must be addressed. Most relational database management systems fail to handle the scalability and flexibility of big data. NoSQL, which is a new concept in database technology, offers support a large volume of data, thereby providing a good data storage and retrieval mechanism. However, NoSQL has no standard data modeling method. The important properties in handling the database relationships need to be considered in NoSQL data modeling. This study proposes a document-oriented data model for big data and then applies this model to migrate relational database applications to NoSQL on the basis of the properties of the ER model. © 2017 IEEE.","data model;

However, the false positive problem (FPP) is the main drawback of SVD-based watermarking schemes. The singular value is the main cause of FPP issues because it a fixed value that does not hold structural information of an image. In this paper, a new SVD-based image watermarking scheme that uses a chaotic map is proposed to overcome this issue. The secret key is first extracted from both the host and watermark image. This key is used to generate a new chaotic matrix and chaotic multiple scaling factors (CMSF) to increase the sensitivity of the proposed scheme. The watermark image is then transformed based on the chaotic matrix before being directly embedded into the singular value of the host image by using the CMSF. The extracted secret key is unique to the host and the watermark images, which improves security and overcomes FPP issues. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme fulfils all watermarking requirements in terms of robustness, imperceptibility, security, and payload. Furthermore, it achieves high robustness with different scaling factors, and outperforms several existing schemes. © 2013 IEEE.","Chaotic map; Image watermark; Integer wavelet transform; IWT; Singular value decomposition; SVD","Chaotic systems; Economic and social effects; Image enhancement; Singular value decomposition; Watermarking; Wavelet decomposition; Chaotic map; High robustness; Integer wavelet transforms; Scaling factors; Singular values; Structural information; Watermark images; Watermarking schemes; Image watermarking","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1)","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Education Malaysia through the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) under Project FRGS/1/2019/ICT05/USM/02/1.","Kumar C., Singh A.K., Kumar P., A recent survey on image water-marking techniques and its application in e-governance, Multimedia Tools Appl., 77, 3, pp. 3597-3622, (2017); Pan J.-S., Huang H.-C., Jain L.C., Intelligent Watermarking Tech-niques, 7, (2004); Huang H.-C., Information Hiding Application, 227, (2009); Bal S.N., Nayak M.R., Sarkar S.K., On the implementation of a secured watermarking mechanism based on cryptography and bit pairs matching, J.

Personality has been shown to be relevant to many types of interactions such as in predicting movie preferences, social relationships, personality and music, and correlation between personality and job performance. Predicting personality from social media become the current trend as the information extracted can be utilized to improve the users' experiences with various computerized interfaces. Thus, many algorithms have been performed to predict personality from social media. In this paper, we compared the performance of several classifiers provided in WEKA namely Bayes, Functions, Rules, Trees, and Meta in predicting student's personality. Based on adopted framework, the profile data of undergraduate students were extracted from Twitter, analyzed, and then classified in the automatic personality prediction. Four features with significant correlation from the profile data have been selected to map into Big Five personality model. Only extraversion dimension of the Big Five was considered in this study. A 10-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the classifiers. Several parameters that were observed in the performance of the classifiers are classification accuracy, F-measure, time taken to build the model, Kappa statistic, and training errors. Experimental evaluation demonstrated that OneR algorithm is the best classifier in terms of the accuracy, F-measure, and Kappa statistic. © 2016 IEEE.","Big Five; Classification; Personality; Social media mining","Classification (of information); Control systems; Social networking (online); Students; 10-fold cross-validation; Big five; Classification accuracy; Experimental evaluation; Personality; Personality predictions; Social media minings; Undergraduate students; Forecasting","","","","","","","Mairesse F., Walker M.A., Mehl M.R., Moore R.K., Using linguistic cues for the automation recognition of personality in conversation and text, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 30, pp. 457-500, (2007); Goldberg L.R., The structure of phenotypic personality traits, American Psychologist, 48, pp. 26-34, (1993); The Myers & Briggs Foundation, (2016); Jung C.G., Psychological Types, (1921); Golbeck J., Robles C., Turner K., Predicting personality with social media, Proc. of 2011 Annual Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing System, pp. 253-262, (2011); McCrae R.R., John P.O., An Introduction to the five-factor model and its applications, Journal of Personality, 60, pp. 175-215, (1992); Zafarani R., Abbasi M.A., Liu H., Social Media Mining: An Introduction (Draft Version, (2014); Allport G.W., Odbert H.S., Trait-names: A psycho-lexical study, Psychological Monographs, 47, (1936); Cattell R.B., The description of personality: Basic traits resolved into clusters, Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 38, pp. 476-506, (1943); Fiske D.W., Consistency of the factorial structures of personality ratings from different sources, Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 44, pp. 329-344, (1949); Tupes E.C., Christal R.C., Recurrent Personality Factors Based on Trait Ratings, (1961); John O.P., Srivastava S., The big-five trait taxonomy: History, measurement, and theoretical perspectives, Handbook of Personality: Theory and Research, (1999); John O.P., Srivastava S., The big-five trait taxonomy: History, measurement, and theoretical perspectives, Handbook of Personality: Theory and Research, 2, pp. 102-138, (2008); Golbeck J., Robles C., Edmondson M., Turner K., Predicting personality from twitter, Proc.

Traditionally, self-assessment method via questionnaire is the most common means to identify personality. Since recommender systems and advertisement campaigns have evolved rapidly, personality computing has become a popular research field to provide personalisation to users. Currently, researchers have utilised social media data for automatically predicting personality. However, it is complex to mine the social media data as they are noisy, free-format, and of varying length and multimedia. This paper proposes a decision tree C4.5 algorithm to automatically predict personality based on Big Five model.

It becomes more demanding with limited samples but with a massive number of features (high dimensionality). The high dimensional and imbalanced data set has posed severe challenges in many real-world applications, such as biomedical data sets. Numerous researchers investigated either imbalanced class or high dimensional data sets and came up with various methods. Nonetheless, few approaches reported in the literature have addressed the intersection of the high dimensional and imbalanced class problem due to their complicated interactions. Lately, feature selection has become a well-known technique that has been used to overcome this problem by selecting discriminative features that represent minority and majority class. This paper proposes a new method called Robust Correlation Based Redundancy and Binary Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (rCBR-BGOA); rCBR-BGOA has employed an ensemble of multi-filters coupled with the Correlation-Based Redundancy method to select optimal feature subsets. A binary Grasshopper optimisation algorithm (BGOA) is used to construct the feature selection process as an optimisation problem to select the best (near-optimal) combination of features from the majority and minority class. The obtained results, supported by the proper statistical analysis, indicate that rCBR-BGOA can improve the classification performance for high dimensional and imbalanced datasets in terms of G-mean and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) performance metrics. © 2020 by the authors.
