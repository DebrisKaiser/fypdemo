Designing an accurate and effective pre-crash system to avoid front and back crashes or mitigating crash severity is the priority goal of any vehicle safety system. To improve crash prediction, vehicle context is collected to analyze the severity of a crash based on safe avoidance time between two vehicles. This work proposes a real time crash prediction based on TGFD Crash Severity Factor model for Periodic Safety Message dissemination protocol in VANET. Simulation results show promising improvements for dissemination of PSMs to the vehicles for prevention of road accidents in highway scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.","Collision avoidance; Crash prediction; Safety message dissemination; Vanet","Collision avoidance; Forecasting; Highway accidents; Information dissemination; Roads and streets; Safety factor; Vehicles; Crash avoidance; Crash prediction; Crash severity; Prevention of road accidents; Safety message disseminations; Vanet; Vehicle safety; Vehicle safety systems; Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","","MAXIS-USM, (304/PKOMP/650804/M151)","This research work is fully funded by a MAXIS-USM research grant (304/PKOMP/650804/M151)","Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015, (2015); McDonald M., Keller H., Klijnhout J., Mauro V., Hall R., Spence A., Fakler O., Intelligent Transport Systems in Europe: Opportunities for Future Research, (2006); Leondes C.T., Intelligent knowledge-based systems: Business and technology in the new millennium, Springer Science & Business Media, (2010); Hartenstein H., Laberteaux K., VANET: Vehicular Applications and Inter-networking Technologies, 1, (2009); Fadilah S.I., Shariff A.R.M., A time gap interval for safe following distance (TGFD) in avoiding car collision in wireless vehicular networks (VANET) envi-ronment, Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation (ISMS), 2014 5th International Conference on, pp. 683-689, (2014); Sperling D., Pike S., Chase R., Will the transportation revolutions improve our lives-or make them worse, Three Revolutions, pp. 1-20, (2018); Liu Z., Ge H., Cheng R., KdV-Burgers equation in the modified continuum model considering the effect of friction and radius on a curved road, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, (2018); Dargay J., Gately D., Income's effect on car and vehicle ownership, worldwide: 1960-2015, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 33, 2, pp. 101-138, (1999); Schafer A., Victor D.G., The future mobility of the world population, Transpor-tation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 34, 3, pp. 171-205, (2000); Gerla M., Kleinrock L., Vehicular networks and the future of the mobile internet, Computer Networks, 55, 2, pp. 457-469, (2011); Peden M., World Report on Road Traffic Injury Preventio Motorola Semiconductor Data Manual, Motorola Semiconductor Products Inc, (2004); Minderhoud M.M., Bovy P.H., Extended time-tocollision measures for road traffic safety assessment, Accident Analysis & Prevention, 33, 1, pp. 89-97, (2001); (2009); Godbole D., Sengupta R., Misener J., Kourjanskaia N., Michael J., Benefit evaluation of crash avoidance systems, Transportation Research, 1621, 1, pp. 1-9, (1998)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","89th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, VTC Spring 2019","28 April 2019 through 1 May 2019","Kuala Lumpur","149083","15502252","978-172811217-6","IVTCD","","English","IEEE Veh Technol Conf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068986443"

However, several issues due to the dynamic nature of VANETs disrupt the efficiency of safety message dissemination. Clustering is a common solution applied to overcome VANET challenges. If a Cluster Head is exposed to accidents, it would lose its role and disband the cluster. When re-clustering happens frequently, a greater amount of overhead is produced. This work presents a modified version of the original Safe Clustering Algorithm (M-SCA) whereby safety distance is applied in the cluster maintenance stage to extend the cluster phase. NS2 simulation is conducted to measure the performance of the proposed scheme under QoS parameters, emergency message inter-arrival time, and overhead. © 2017 IEEE.","cluster; safety distance; VANET","Alarm systems; Highway accidents; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Cluster; Cluster-heads; Clusterings; Collision warning system; Cooperative collision warning; Dynamic nature; Safety distances; Safety message disseminations; VANET; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Clustering algorithms","","","","","","","Almalag M.S., Olariu S., Weigle M.C., Tdma cluster-based mac for vanets (tc-mac), World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM), 2012 IEEE International Symposiumon A, pp. 1-6, (2012); AlMheiri S.M., AlQamzi H.S., MANETs andVANETs clustering algorithms: A survey, GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCCCE), 2015 IEEE 8th, pp. 1-6, (2015); Aissa M., Arafah B., Henchiri M., Safe Clustering Algorithm in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks; Balon N., Introduction to Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks and the BroadcastStorm Problem; Basu P., Khan N., Little T.D., A mobility basedmetric for clustering in mobile ad hoc networks, Distributedcomputing Systems Workshop, 2001 International Conference on, pp. 413-418, (2001); Cha S.H., A survey of broadcast protocols for vehicular ad-hocnetworks, SmartCR, 4, 4, pp. 246-255, (2014); Fadilah S.I., Rahman A., A Novel Adaptive Time Gap BasedCongestion Control for Vehicular Ad Hoc Network, (2006); Fadilah S.I., Shariff A.R.M., A time gap intervalfor safe following distance (tgfd) in avoiding car collision in wireless vehicular networks (vanet) environment, IntelligentSystems, Modelling and Simulation (ISMS), 2014 5th InternationalConference on, pp. 683-689, (2014); Goonewardene R.T., Ali F.H., Stipidis E.L.I.A.S., Robust mobility adaptive clustering scheme with support for geographicrouting for vehicular ad hoc networks, IET Intelligent TransportSystems, 3, 2, pp. 148-158, (2009); Gupta N., Prakash A., Tripathi R., Adaptive beaconing in mobility aware clustering based mac protocol for safety messagedissemination in vanet, Wireless Communications and MobileComputing, 2017, (2017); Jiang D., Taliwal V., Meier A., Holfelder W., Herrtwich R., Design of 5.9 GHz DSRC-based vehicular safety communication, IEEEWireless Communications, 13, 5, (2006); Khan A.A., An Evolutionary Game Theoretic Approach for Stableclustering in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) (Doctoraldissertation), (2015); Kuklinski S., Wolny G., Density based clustering algorithm for VANETs, Testbeds and Research Infrastructures for the Development of Networks &Communities and Workshops, 2009.TridentCom 2009. 5th International Conference on, pp. 1-6, (2009); Kumar V., Mishra S., Chand N., Applications of VANETs: Present &future, Communications and Network, 5, 1, (2013); Moustafa H., Senouci S.M., Jerbi M., Introduction tovehicular networks, Vehicular Networks, 1, (2009); Najafzadeh S., Ithnin N.B., Abd Razak S., Broadcasting in connected and fragmented vehicular ad hoc networks, InternationalJournal of Vehicular Technology, 2014, (2014); Nguyen V., Kim O.T.T., Dang D.N.M., Kim S.S., Hong C.S., Application of the lowest-ID algorithm in cluster-basedTDMA system for VANETs, Information Networking (ICOIN), 2015International Conference on, pp. 25-30, (2015); Rawashdeh Z.Y., Mahmud S.M., Media accesstechnique for cluster-based vehicular ad hoc networks, VehicularTechnology Conference, 2008.

The standards from European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) for Intelligent Transport System (ITS) provide necessary upper-layer specifications for safety message dissemination between vehicles using Cooperative Aware Messages (CAM) and Decentralized Event Notification Message (DENM). Besides, mobile radio technology of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) in Release-14 comes with two modes of communication, which is mode 3 and mode 4 to support vehicle to vehicle communications. The relationship between vehicle time gap, speed, and UE transmit power significantly impacts the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and throughput. With higher vehicle moving speeds, longer safe distances must be kept in ensuring safety. However, at longer safe distances, we have proven that communication may be lost because CAM messages cannot be exchanged successfully. As a result, no vehicle safety can be guaranteed using V2V communication. This may get worse in urban or cities environment where interference is dominant. Simulation results provide evidence that variable distance between vehicles cannot be ignored to ensure vehicle safety with successful message communication among them © 2022.

It is very common to download and install desired mobile applications from application store to aid in completing particular tasks with ease. However, this behavior exposes user towards privacy risk as it has become a concern in smartphone usage. In this research, we propose a mathematical model named Privacy Risk Model (PRiMo) that measures the risk score of a user in smartphone usage. We are approaching the privacy issues in mobile applications from the individual's perspective. We conduct studies on different categories of mobile applications to determine the risk posed by the mobile applications. There is no standardization for residual risk. Therefore, by using the proposed model, we are exploring and creating a standardization for residual risk that becomes a benchmark for user to accept and live with that risk. © 2019 The Authors.","Mobile application; Privacy risk score; Residual risk; Sensitive data risk; Sensor","Behavioral research; Data privacy; Information systems; Information use; Mobile computing; Quality of service; Sensors; Smartphones; Standardization; Application stores; Data exposure; Mobile applications; Privacy preservation; Privacy risks; Quality of service model; Residual risk; Sensitive datas; Risk assessment","","","","","Ambient Intelligence Smart Home Automation using, (1001/PKOMP/8014003); University Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work is funded by a Research Grant provided by University Sains Malaysia.

Drivers control the vehicle directly or supervise the situation according to information displayed on the instrument panel. Different from the time-headway and traditional braking models, this paper aims to propose a new safety indicator called time gap interval for safe following distance (TGFD) which incorporates vehicle dynamics and driver behavior factors that includes the time component to broadcast and propagate suitable safety messages in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) environment. This simulation-based safety indicator could analyze the capability of a vehicle in a car-following situation to safely stop without hitting the vehicle in front when an emergency brake is applied by considering the proper reaction time of the driver of the following. Results from this simulation study indicate that the TGFD is more comprehensive safety indicator for safety analysis. © 2014 IEEE.","Collision Avoidance; Safe Distance; Time Gap; VANET","Collision avoidance; Intelligent systems; Traffic control; Vehicles; Dynamic cooperation; Safe distance; Safety indicator; Simulation studies; Time gap; VANET; Vehicle dynamics; Wireless vehicular networks; Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Brackstone M., McDonald M., Car-following: A historical review, Transportation Research Part F, 2, 4, pp. 181-196, (1999); Gipps P.G., A behavioural car-following model for computer simulation, Transportation Research Part B, 15, 2, pp. 105-111, (1981); Werling M., Kaempchen N., Wollherr D., Buss M., Lanebased safety assessment of road scenes using Inevitable Collision States, Proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV '12), pp. 31-36, (2012); Adell E., Varhelyi A., Fontana M.D., The effects of adriver assistance system for safe speed and safe distance- A real-life field study, Transportation Research Part C, 19, 1, pp. 145-155, (2011); Kannan S., Thangavelu A., Kalivaradhan R.B., An intelligent driver assistance system (I-DAS) for vehicle safety modelling using ontology approach, International Journal of UbiComp, 1, 3, pp. 15-29, (2010); Biral F., Da Lio M., Saroldi A., Tango F., Bertolazzi E., Supporting drivers in keeping safe speed and safe distance: The SASPENCE subproject within the European framework programme 6 integrating project PReVENT, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 11, 3, pp. 525-538, (2010); Wu Y., Xie J., Du L., Hou Z., Analysis on trafficsafety distance of considering the deceleration of the current vehicle, InProceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Computing Technology and Automation (ICICTA '09), pp. 491-494, (2009); Luo Q., Xun L., Cao Z., Huang Y., Simulation analysis and study on car-following safety distance model based on braking process of leading vehicle, InProceedings of the of 9th World Congress OnIntelligent Control and Automation (WCICA'11), pp. 740-743, (2011); Ayres T.J., Li L., Schleuning D., Young D., Preferred timeheadway of highway drivers, Proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Proceedings, pp. 826-829, (2001); Touran A., Brackstone M.A., McDonald M., A collision model for safety evaluation of autonomous intelligent cruise control, Accident Analysis and Prevention, 31, 5, pp. 567-578, (1999); Tordeux A., Lassarre S., Roussignol A.N.D.M., An adaptive t ime-g a p car-following model, Transportation Research Part B : Methodological, 44, 8-9, pp. 1115-1131, (2010); Lin T., Hwang S., Green P., Effects of time-gap settings of adaptive cruise control (acc) on driving performance and subjective acceptance in a bus driving simulator, Safety Science, 47, 5, pp. 620-625, (2009); Karim M.R., Et al., Minimum safe time gap (MSTG) as a new safety indicator incorporating vehicle and driver factors, Proceedings of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 9, (2013); McGee, Et al., Highway Design and Operation Standards Affected by Driver Characteristics, 2, (1983)","","Al-Dabass D.; Sauli Z.; Zakaria Z.","IEEE Computer Society","","5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation, ISMS 2014","27 January 2014 through 29 January 2014","Langkawi","117206","21660662","978-147993857-5","","","English","Proc. - Int.

Parameters such as system load, service characteristics and user mobility are the main criteria in network selection strategy. In this paper, we devise a mobility estimation method for a Mobile Node (MN) during initial network selection and Vertical Handover (VHO). The method relies on a new prediction dwelling time and the Call Holding Time (CHT) of a user. By comparing the predicted dwelling time with the CHT, a MN is able to make decision which network is suitable to be used in order to minimize the VHO. The proposed theoretical model has been validated by the Monte-Carlo experiments. The simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.","Dwelling time; Network selection; Wireless","","","","","","","","Piamrat K., Ksentini A., Bonnin J.-M., Viho C., Radio resource management in emerging heterogeneous wireless networks, Computer Communications, 34, 9, pp. 1066-1076, (2011); Hasib A., Fapojuwo A.O., Analysis of common radio resource management scheme for end-to-end qos support in multiservice hetero-geneous wireless networks, Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on, 57, 4, pp. 2426-2439, (2008); Hasib A., Fapojuwo A.O., Cross-layer radio resource management in integrated wwan and wlan networks, Computer Networks, 54, 3, pp. 341-356, (2010); Shi Z., Zhu Q., Zhu X., Performance analysis of an improved common radio resource management algorithm based on load balance and service characteristics, Wireless Personal Communications, pp. 1-22, (2012); Wu Q., Du Z., Yang P., Yao Y.D., Wang J., Traffic-aware online network selection in heterogeneous wireless networks, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 65, 1, pp. 381-397, (2016); Kirsal Y., Ever E., Kocyigit A., Gemikonakli O., Mapp G., Modelling and analysis of vertical handover in highly mobile environments, The Journal of Supercomputing, 71, 12, pp. 4352-4380, (2015); Mahmood A., Zen H., Othman A.-K., An optimized travelling time estimation mechanism for minimizing handover failures and unnecessary handovers from cellular networks to wlans, International Journal of Pervasive Computing and Communications, 11, 1, pp. 2-16, (2015); Hussain R., Malik S.A., Abrar S., Riaz R.A., Ahmed H., Khan S.A., Vertical handover necessity estimation based on a new dwell time prediction model for minimizing unnecessary handovers to a wlan cell, Wireless Personal Communications, 71, 2, pp. 1217-1230, (2013); Shi Z., Zhu Q., A calculation method for handoff rate based on angle mobility model, Systems and Informatics (ICSAI), 2012 International Conference on, pp. 1389-1392, (2012); Gubner J.A., Probability and Random Processes for Electrical and Computer Engineers, (2006)","","","Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka","","","","","","21801843","","","","English","J.

Through these functionalities, Smartphone owner can exchange information to each other by sharing links or even files. However, an attacker see these as an advantage to perform an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack. APT is an attack which incorporates both social engineering attack and malware. In this paper, the authors will shed light on how APT attack through spear phishing can occur in Smartphone and how to detect it. First, the authors will examine the tactics that can be used by the attacker to perform a successful social engineering attack. Then, based on the discussion that has been made, the authors have used a machine learning algorithm to classify whether a certain URL is a phish or not. Lastly, the authors have evaluated the propose technique using machine learning and obtained more than 90% accuracy. This proves, that the proposed technique would able to help mitigating APT attack through spear phishing in the Smartphone. © 2018 The Authors.","Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Cyber Crime; Decision Tree; Smart Phone; Typosquat","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Crime; Decision trees; Information systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Smartphones; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); Attack detection; Cyber-crimes; Multi-purpose; Social engineering; Spear phishing; Typosquat; Malware","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) No : 203/PKOMP/6711424 of under the Universiti Sains Malaysia and Government of Malaysia.","Baumgartner K., Raiu C., Maslennikov D., Android Trojan Found in Targeted Attack, (2013); Zulkefli Z., Mahinderjit-Singh M., Malim N., Advanced Persistent Threat Mitigation Using Multi Level Security Access Control Framework, Vol. 9158 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 90-105; Myonlinesecurity, Spoofed Wupos Agent Portal Upgrade for All Agents Delivers Java Adwind/Jacksbot, (2017); SonicWall, Sonicwall Security Center, (2014); Sood A.K., Enbody R.J., Targeted cyberattacks: A superset of advanced persistent threats, Security & Privacy, IEEE, 11, 1, pp. 54-61, (2013); Lau L.B., Singh M.M., Samsudin A., Trusted System Modules for Tackling Apt Via Spear-phishing Attack in Byod Environment, (2015); Zhao G., Xu K., Xu L., Wu B., Detecting apt malware infections based on malicious dns and trac analysis, IEEE Access, 3, pp. 1132-1142, (2015); Harbison C., New Url Malware Will Punish You for Sloppy Typing: Mac, Windows Computers Vulnerable to Latest '.om 'Url Hijacks, (2016); Fusco M.A.M., The Cybersquatting Countdown Has Begun: The Moncler Case, (2016); Roth C., Dunham M., Watson J., Cybersquatting; Typosquatting Facebook's $2.8 Million in Damages and Domain Names, (2013); Agten P., Joosen W., Piessens F., Nikiforakis N., Seven months' worth of mistakes: A longitudinal study of typosquatting abuse, Proceedings of the 22nd Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2015), Internet Society, (2015); Wang Y.-M., Beck D., Wang J., Verbowski C., Daniels B., Strider typo-patrol: Discovery and analysis of systematic typo-squatting, Proceedings of the 2nd Conference on Steps to Reducing Unwanted Trac on the Internet-Volume 2, (2006); Mozilla, Learn Web Development: What Is A Url?, (2016); Mozilla, Learn Web Development: What Is A Domain Name?, (2016); Maurer M.-E., Hofer L., Sophisticated Phishers Make More Spelling Mistakes: Using URL Similarity Against Phishing, pp. 414-426, (2012); Kang J., Lee D., Advanced white list approach for preventing access to phishing sites, Convergence Information Technology, 2007.

In this paper, we conduct a study to investigate eleven (11) adoptions factors of U-Learning with NFC and ranking them using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. We also utilized Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Technology Readiness (TR), and combination of TAM and TR (TRAM) as theoretical framework. We have identified TRAM as the best tool based on literature review and utilized the theory to propose an NFC-Enabled Ubiquitous Technology model. The model was utilized to design a questionnaire for survey about user acceptance. Results from the online survey were analyzed using AHP in an absolute measurement approach method. Results from AHP show that optimism is the most influencing factor in adoption of U-Learning using NFC technology followed by innovativeness and accessibility.

The evolution of 5G V2X enhances the physical layer of LTE V2X in terms of resource allocation, frame structure, and many more. The amendments in the physical layer are to enable the exchange of safety and advanced driving services within a geographical area. The introduction of 25 use cases in the 3GPP Release 15 standard with different quality of service (QoS) requirements and high demand for data rates makes it possible for the enhancements. Delivering the services of the established use cases becomes a challenge in 5G-V2V communication. Release 14 and release 15 mark the evolution of LTE V2X, while Release 16 highlights 3GPP advancements for 5G V2X NR services, and Release 17 focuses on future enhancements with the applications of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study examines sidelink communication, resource allocation for LTE V2V and 5G-V2V, and NR V2X enablers such as Network Slicing (NS) and Machine Learning (ML) with recent capacity studies on V2V employing the two 5G enablers. In 5G-V2V Sidelink communication, Physical Sidelink Shared Channel (PSSCH) is responsible for broadcasting various messages using release 14 and release 16 waveforms. The capacity of PSSCH to broadcast the 5G services, such as Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM), Decentralized Environmental Messages (DENM), Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) contents for environmental perception, and sensor DATA applications for driving intention, becomes a challenge. This study considered this challenge by providing a mathematical model of the capacity of V2V and V2I links in the 5G V2X network for mode selection using the Poisson point process and Poisson line process within a circular region. © 2022 Lavoisier.

The hop-count is derived by identifying the next-hop node that has the minimum distance to the sink node. Meanwhile, the node-degree is obtained through the vehicle ID of each neighbouring nodes in its radius. All the nodes or vehicles in VANETs context were assumed to be equipped with an OnBoard Unit (OBU) that will periodically send beacon messages to other nodes around the transmission range area. From the simulation results, it is found that the HDbR protocol is suitable to be used in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) as it produces high network throughput and minimum end-to-end delay. Thus it is comparable to existing protocol such as AODV when it was evaluated in various speeds scenario. © 2013 IEEE.","hop-count; node-degree; routing protocol; VANETs","Routing protocols; Vehicle transmissions; End to end delay; High network throughput; Hopcount; Neighbouring nodes; node-degree; Transmission ranges; VANETs; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Spaho E., Barolli L., Mino G., Xhafa F., Kolici V., Vanet simulators: A survey on mobility and routing protocols, Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications (BWCCA), International Conference, pp. 1-10, (2011); Shariff A.R.M., A Novel Topology Dependent Model for Hop-by-Hop Routing Using Static Metrics, (2007); Perkins C., Royer E., Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector rout-ing, Mobile Computing Systems and Applications.

WLAN has been widely used as a complementary service for cellular network operator to offload their traffic. Based on traffic characteristics, user mobility and load balance we propose a new CRRM scheme that include traffic offloading functionality. When a user arrives in out of hot-spot area and no resource is available, the algorithm will identify some of the traffic to be offloaded in the overlap area from cellular network to WLAN and release the resource for the new user to use. The proposed approach also attempts to minimize unnecessary vertical handover (VHO) between cellular and WLAN. The effectiveness of the scheme is assessed analytically using the theory of 3D-Markov Chain. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CRRM scheme increase the overall system throughput, reduce the new call blocking probability and provide less service costs to the users. © 2014 IEEE.","","Blocking probability; Heterogeneous networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Radio systems; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Common Radio Resource Management; Complementary services; Heterogeneous wireless network; New call-blocking probability; Numerical results; Resource efficiencies; Traffic characteristics; Vertical handovers; Markov chains","","","","","","","Index C.V.N., Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2010-2015, (2011); Mueck M., Piipponen A., Kalliojarvi K., Dimitrakopoulos G., Tsagkaris K., Demestichas P., Casadevall F., Perez-Romero J., Sallent O., Baldini G., Et al., Etsi reconfigurable radio systems: Status and future directions on software defined radio and cognitive radio standards, Communications Magazine, IEEE, 48, 9, pp. 78-86, (2010); Study into Network Selection Requirement for non-3gpp, (2009); Yu F., Krishnamurthy V., Optimal joint session admission control in integrated wlan and cdma cellular networks with vertical handoff, Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on, 6, 1, pp. 126-139, (2007); Piamrat K., Ksentini A., Bonnin J.-M., Viho C., Radio resource management in emerging heterogeneous wireless networks, Computer Communications, 34, 9, pp. 1066-1076, (2011); Gelabert X., Perez-Romero J., Sallent O., Agusti R., A marko-vian approach to radio access technology selection in heterogeneous multiaccess/multiservice wireless networks, Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on, 7, 10, pp. 1257-1270, (2008); Gelabert X., Sallent O., Perez-Romero J., Agusti R., Performance evaluation of radio access selection strategies in constrained multiaccess/multi-service wireless networks, Computer Networks, 55, 1, pp. 173-192, (2011); Hasib A., Fapojuwo A.O., Analysis of common radio resource management scheme for end-to-end qos support in multiservice heterogeneous wireless networks, Vehicular Technology, IEEE Transactions on, 57, 4, pp. 2426-2439, (2008); Shi Z., Zhu Q., Zhu X., Performance analysis of an improved common radio resource management algorithm based on load balance and service characteristics, Wireless Personal Communications, pp. 1-22, (2012); Mehmeti F., Spyropoulos T., Khalife H., Vania C., Leguay J., Sermpezis P., Khalife H., Conan V., Leguay J., Performance analysis of' on-the-spot"" mobile data offioading, IEEE Globecom, (2013); Shi Z., Zhu Q., Zhao S., A vertical handoff rate analysis based on angle mobility model in heterogeneous networks, Signal Processing (Xinhao Chuli), 28, 7, pp. 1029-1036, (2012); Gross D., Harris C.M., Fundamentals of Queueing Theory, (1985); Golub G.H., Van Loan C.F., Matrix Computation, (1996)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Communications Society Indonesia Chapter","2014 International Conference on IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Wireless and Mobile, APWiMob 2014","28 August 2014 through 30 August 2014","Bali","108507","","978-147993711-0","","","English","Proc., APWiMob: IEEE Asia Pac.

The behaviour of granting permissions requested by apps might expose the Android smartphone user to privacy risks. The existing works lack a formalized mathematical model that can quantify user and system applications risks. No multifaceted data collector tool can also be used to monitor the collection of user data and the risk posed by each application. A benchmark of the risk level that alerts the user and distinguishes between acceptable and unacceptable risk levels in Android smartphone user does not exist. Hence, to address privacy risk, a formalized privacy model called PRiMo that uses a tree structure and calculus knowledge is proposed. An App-sensor Mobile Data Collector (AMoDaC) is developed and implemented in real life to analyse user data accessed by mobile applications through the permissions granted and the risks involved. A benchmark is proposed by comparing the proposed PRiMo outcome with the existing available testing metrics. The results show that Tools & Utility/Productivity applications posed the highest risk as compared to other categories of applications. Furthermore, 29 users faced low and acceptable risk, while two users faced medium risk. According to the benchmark proposed, users who faced risks below 25% are considered as safe. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed work is 96.8%. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, seamless connection between these technologies play important role as the performance indicator. In this paper, we consider the user's velocity and channel holding time to predict the user's dwelling time in the WLAN area to assist in the initial network selection. Based on the mobility prediction, network load and type of services, the proposed algorithm will select the most suitable radio access network for the user. In addition, we also incorporate the traffic offloading method in order to accept as many users to the system while maintaining the quality of service of the users. Through extensive discrete-event simulation, the results show that the proposed solution has better performance as compared to the location-based (WLAN First) and mobility threshold proposals. © 2015 IEEE.","Common Radio Resource management (CRRM); Heterogeneous Wireless network; Network Selection; Traffic Offloading","Discrete event simulation; Heterogeneous networks; Quality of service; Channel holding time; Common Radio Resource Management; Heterogeneous wireless network; Heterogenous wireless network; Mobility predictions; Network selection; Performance indicators; Radio access networks; Wireless networks","","","","","","","Aijaz A., Aghvami H., Amani M., A survey on mobile data offloading: Technical and business perspectives, Wireless Communications, IEEE, 20, pp. 104-112, (2013); Piamrat K., Ksentini A., Bonnin J.-M., Viho C., Radio resource management in emerging heterogeneous wireless networks, Computer Communications, 34, pp. 1066-1076, (2011); Gelabert X., Perez-Romero J., Salient O., Agusti R., A Markovian approach to radio access technology selection in heterogeneous multiaccess/multiservice wireless networks, Mobile Computing, IEEE Transactions on, 7, pp. 1257-1270, (2008); Gelabert X., Salient O., Perez-Romero J., Agusti R., Performance evaluation of radio access selection strategies in constrained multiaccess/multi-service wireless networks, Computer Networks, 55, pp. 173-192, (2011); Kim D.K., Griffith D., Golmie N., A new call admission control scheme for heterogeneous wireless networks, Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on, 9, pp. 3000-3005, (2010); Khloussy E., Gelabert X., Jiang Y., A revenue-maximizing scheme for radio access technology selection in heterogeneous wireless networks with user profile differentiation, Advances in Communication Networking, pp. 66-77, (2013); Shi Z., Zhu Q., Zhu X., Performance analysis of an improved common radio resource management algorithm based on load balance and service characteristics, Wireless Personal Communications, 71, pp. 317-338, (2013); Yilmaz O., Furuskar A., Pettersson J., Simonsson A., Access selection in WCDMA and WLAN multi-access networks/, Vehicular Technology Conference, 2005, pp. 2220-2224, (2005); Ma D., Ma M., Proactive load balancing with admission control for heterogeneous overlay networks, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 13, pp. 1671-1680, (2013)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","35th IEEE Region 10 Conference, TENCON 2015","1 November 2015 through 4 November 2015","Macau","118952","21593442","978-147998641-5","85QXA","","English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962179671"

The behaviour of granting permissions requested by apps might expose the Android smartphone user to privacy risks. The existing works lack a formalized mathematical model that can quantify user and system applications risks. No multifaceted data collector tool can also be used to monitor the collection of user data and the risk posed by each application. A benchmark of the risk level that alerts the user and distinguishes between acceptable and unacceptable risk levels in Android smartphone user does not exist. Hence, to address privacy risk, a formalized privacy model called PRiMo that uses a tree structure and calculus knowledge is proposed. An App-sensor Mobile Data Collector (AMoDaC) is developed and implemented in real life to analyse user data accessed by mobile applications through the permissions granted and the risks involved. A benchmark is proposed by comparing the proposed PRiMo outcome with the existing available testing metrics. The results show that Tools & Utility/Productivity applications posed the highest risk as compared to other categories of applications. Furthermore, 29 users faced low and acceptable risk, while two users faced medium risk. According to the benchmark proposed, users who faced risks below 25% are considered as safe.

Service providers constantly looking for suitable technologies and mechanisms to reduce the network congestion by offloading the data traffic, where Wi-Fi is an excellent option. In the traffic steering process, network selection is the most vital process, as it affects the user’s network experience. This paper focuses on enhancing the procedure of Call Admission Control (CAC). Two key functions were introduced into the call admission procedure, namely Channel Reserve Engine (CRE) and Traffic Steering Policy (TSP). Based on the simulation results, it is found the proposed CAC reduces the call blocking probability as compared with conventional CAC. Thus, it is suitable to be implemented in WLAN/Cellular integration. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Behavioral research; Blocking probability; Wi-Fi; Call admission; Call blocking probabilities; Cellular network; Network congestions; Network selection; Service provider; User behaviors; WLAN/Cellular; Traffic congestion","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This research is supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS).","Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, (2014); Hotspot 2.0 Making Wi-Fi as Easy to Use and Secure as Cellular, (2013); Song W., Jiang H., Zhuang W., Shen X., Resource management for QoS support in cellular/Wi-Fi inter working, network, IEEE, 19, 5, (2005); Wang X., Mellor J., Al-Begain K., Towards Providing Qos for Integrated Cellular and Wi-Fi Networks, (2003); Abaye A., Lo W., Sun M., (2007); Seth A., International journal of advanced research in IT and engineering.

Many of these devices rely on personal identification numbers (PIN) as a form of user authentication. One of the main concerns in the use of mobile devices is the possibility of a breach in security and privacy if the device is seized by an outside party. Threats can possibly come from friends as well as strangers. Smart devices can be easily lost due to their small size, thereby exposing details of users’ private lives. User behavior authentication is designed to overcome this problem by utilizing user behavioral techniques to continuously assess user identity. This study proposed a behavioral data profiling technique that utilizes data collected from the user behavior application to verify the identity of the user in a continuous manner. By utilizing a combination of analytical hierarchy process and correlation coefficient method, the best experimental results were obtained by verifying the identity of six types of user behaviors to determine the different behaviors. Based on the results, this study proposes a new authentication technique that enables verification of a user’s identity through their application usage in a transparent manner. Behavioral data profiling is designed in a modular manner that will not reject user access based on a single application activity but on several consecutive abnormal application usages to balance the trade-off between security and usability. The proposed framework is evaluated using a PIN-based technique and achieved an overall 95% confidence level. Behavioral data profiling provides a significant improvement in the security afforded to the device and user convenience. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Correlation coefficient; Decision-making; Security of smartphone; User behavior","Authentication; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Smartphones; Abnormal applications; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Authentication techniques; Correlation coefficient; Correlation coefficient method; Personal identification number; Security and usabilities; User behaviors; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Guo C., Wang H.J., Zhu W., Et al., Smart-phone attacks and defenses, Hotnets, (2004); Leavitt N., Malicious code moves to mobile devices, IEEE Comput, 33, 12, pp. 16-19, (2000); Dagon D., Martin T., Starner T., Mobile phones as computing devices: The viruses are coming!, IEEE Pervasive Comput, 3, 4, pp. 11-15, (2004); Li Q., Clark G., Mobile security: A look ahead, IEEE Secur.

Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative awareness communication is an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technology in enabling safe, reliable, and efficient transportation management. However, there are many limitations to the implementation of the V2V communication system in the real world. The requirements for applying the V2V communication system to an urban area will be different when implemented within other areas. Therefore, the objectives of this research are focused on analyzing the implementation of the ITS V2V cooperative awareness communication based on local traffic motion constraints in the non-US and non-EU country. This research is accomplished by utilizing the survey-based and simulation-based method. As a case study, this research considers to utilized local traffic motion constraints based on a geographical map, road characteristics, and urban mobility at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) neighborhood in Penang, Malaysia. The simulation results show that the deployment of V2V cooperative awareness communication by considering several local motion constraints has several impacts on the quality of urban travel mobility. The efficiency of travel time could be increased by approximately 19.40 %, and the average of vehicles speed is possible improved until 1.10 m/s. The existence of local traffic motion constraints is very fundamental to create a realistic vehicular mobility model for the deployment of ITS V2V cooperative awareness communication in future development. © 2019 IEEE.","Cooperative Awareness Communication; ITS; Motion Constraints; Traffic Mobility; V2V","Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Roads and streets; Travel time; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Intelligent transportation systems; Motion constraints; Simulation-based method; Traffic mobility; Transportation management; Transportation safety; Vehicle to vehicles; Vehicular mobility models; Cooperative communication","","","","","","","IEEE Std 1609.0-2019 (Revision of IEEE Std 1609.0-2013), Vol., No., pp. 1-106, (2019); Harding J., Powell G., Yoon R., Fikentscher J., Doyle C., Vehicleto-vehicle Communications: Readiness of V2V Technology for Application, (2014); Hartenstein H., Laberteaux L.P., A tutorial survey on vehicular ad hoc networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 46, 6, pp. 164-171, (2008); Afdhal A., Elizar E., Enhanced route guidance and navigation for emergency vehicle using V2I-based cooperative communication, 2015 International Electronics Symposium (IES), Surabaya, pp. 145-150, (2015); Harri J., Filali F., Bonnet C., Mobility models for vehicular ad hoc networks: A survey and taxonomy, IEEE Communications Surveys &Tutorials, 11, 4, pp. 19-41, (2009); Afdhal A., Ahmadiar A., Nasaruddin N., V2V mobility modeling and simulation using pbc messages for traffic congestion mitigation, 2018 IEEE International Conference on Communication, Networks and Satellite (Comnetsat), Indonesia, pp. 28-33, (2018); Lyamin N., Vinel A., Jonsson M., Bellalta B., Cooperative awareness in vanets: On etsi en 302 637-2 performance, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 67, 1, pp. 17-28, (2018); Kim B., Et al., Nearest-first: Efficient relaying scheme in heterogeneous v2v communication environments, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 23615-23627, (2019); Afdhal A., Performance modelling of v2v application based on local traffic mobility pattern, Dissertation, School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Penang, Malaysia, (2013)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2019 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Computational Intelligence, CYBERNETICSCOM 2019","22 August 2019 through 24 August 2019","Banda Aceh","153041","","978-172810867-4","","","English","Proc.: CYBERNETICSCOM - IEEE Int.

Vehicle to vehicle communications (V2V) is the pivotal enabler in 5G-V2X by allowing the exchange of Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) over the Physical Sidelink Shared Channel (PSSCH). In this paper, we modeled the performance of the 5G V2V PSSCH capacity limits based on different CAM payload sizes and vehicle densities using M/G/1 queuing theory and Newton Raphson (N-R) method. Results proved that 5G V2V cell capacity demands is in the order of multiple Gbps. PSSCH message should be kept below 1500 bytes to ensure moderate capacity demands below 1 Gbps limit. For any given practical 5G V2V system vehicle densities, size of CAM data payload and generation times will influence capacity limits. System capacity increase with increasing PSSCH message sizes and number of vehicles arriving into the system, with PSSCH message sizes being the more dominant contributor. Average capacity growth is larger in the 1000 to 1500 bytes region of about 130% as compared to higher PSSCH message size regions. The results ultimately presents important understanding on the relation between different CAM payload sizes and the resultant PSSCH message sizes, and their impact on total system capacities. © 2023 THE AUTHORS","5G V2V Sidelink; CAM packet size; Capacity limit; M/G/1; Newton Raphson; PSSCH","5G mobile communication systems; Cams; Cooperative communication; Numerical methods; Vehicle safety; Vehicle to Everything; 5g V2V sidelink; Capacity limit; Channel's capacity; Cooperative awareness message packet size; M/G/1; Newton raphson; Newton-Raphson's method; Packet size; Physical sidelink shared channel; Shared channel; Vehicle to vehicle communications","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2014/ICT03/USM/02/1)","Acknowledgment to “ Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with Project Code: FRGS/1/2014/ICT03/USM/02/1 ”.","Scarlet D., The 5G Evolution, J.

Many simulations in VANET develop only message dissemination protocol without considering the safe time needed between moving vehicles and these are rather inaccurate for safety preventions because communications without an effective time gap between vehicles could still lead to collisions. Passenger vehicles avoidance time can be associated with L0-L2 and L3-L5 levels of autonomy, dependent on either human-induced deceleration braking or full automated system braking. Two passenger vehicle avoidance time models have been proposed. The results obtained shows marked differences in the needed avoidance time for safe vehicle braking to avoid a crash. A delay of 4s is suggested to maintain a suitable avoidance time between leading and following vehicles for CAVs in urban and highway roads. © 2019 IEEE.","Autonomous; Avoidance time; CAV; TGFD; VANET","Accidents; Automation; Autonomous vehicles; Automated systems; Autonomous; Autonomous vehicle technologies; Avoidance time; Message dissemination; Passenger vehicles; TGFD; VANET; Vehicle to vehicle communications","","","","","University of Southern Maine, USM, (304/PKOMP/650804/M151)","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research work is fully funded by a USM research grant (304/PKOMP/650804/M151).","Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018, (2018); Violence W.H.O.D.O., Prevention I., Violence W.H.O., Prevention I., Global Status Report on Road Safety: Time for Action, (2009); Singh H., Dhattarwal S., Pattern and distribution of injuries in fatal road traffic accidents in Rohtak (haryana), JIAFM, 26, pp. 20-23, (2004); Suriyapaiboonwattana K., Pornavalai C., Chakraborty G., An adaptive alert message dissemination protocol for vanet to improve road safety, 2009 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, pp. 1639-1644, (2009); Cheng H.T., Shan H., Zhuang W., Infotainment and road safety service support in vehicular networking: From a communication perspective, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 25, pp. 2020-2038, (2011); Bishop R., Intelligent vehicle applications worldwide, IEEE Intelligent Systems and Their Applications, 15, pp. 78-81, (2000); Kumar S.S., Vehicular ad hoc network, World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, International Journal of Computer, Electrical, Automation, Control and Information Engineering, 8, pp. 627-630, (2014); Hartenstein H., Laberteaux L., A tutorial survey on vehicular ad hoc networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 46, (2008); ElBatt T., Goel S.K., Holland G., Krishnan H., Parikh J., Cooperative collision warning using dedicated short range wireless communications, Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks, pp. 1-9, (2006); Li W., Wu J., Ma X., Zhang Z., On reliability requirement for bsm broadcast for safety applications in dsrc system, 2014 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium Proceedings, pp. 946-950, (2014); Mejri M.N., Ben-Othman J., Hamdi M., Survey on vanet security challenges and possible cryptographic solutions, Vehicular Communications, 1, pp. 53-66, (2014); Eze E.C., Zhang S., Liu E., Vehicular ad hoc networks (vanets): Current state, challenges, potentials and way forward, 2014 20th International Conference on Automation and Computing, pp. 176-181, (2014); Reuse F.-B., Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, (2018); Society of Automative Engineers; Abe M., Vehicle Handling Dynamics: Theory and Application, (2015); Cervero R., Linking urban transport and land use in developing countries, Journal of Transport and Land Use, 6, pp. 7-24, (2013); Delpiano R., Herrera J.M., Coeymans J.A., Characteristics of lateral vehicle interaction, Transportmetrica A: Transport Science, 11, pp. 636-647, (2015); Ranney T.A., Psychological factors that influence car-following and car-following model development, Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 2, pp. 213-219, (1999); Rothery R.W., Car following Models, (1992); May A.D., Traffic Flow Fundamentals, 7632, (1990); Gipps P.G., A behavioural car-following model for computer simulation, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 15, pp. 105-111, (1981); Braskstone M., McDonald M., Car Following: A Historical Review, Transportation Research Part F. 2, (2000); Fadilah S.I., Shariff A.R.M., A time gap interval for safe following distance (tgfd) in avoiding car collision in wireless vehicular networks (vanet) environment, Intelligent Systems, Modelling and Simulation (ISMS), 2014 5th International Conference on, pp. 683-689, (2014); Green M., How long does it take to stop?

In this proposed work, a Pre-Stored Cloudlet is introduced. Pre-stored Cloudlet is where the Cloudlet is pre-stored with encoded game videos in it transmitted from the Main Cloud. The main drawbacks of the existing Mobile Cloud Gaming (MCG) are long distances between the Cloud and mobile users, strongly dependent on network, it consumes high bandwidth and causes latency. We proposed a system architecture to overcome the existing problem in MCG by introducing Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc mobile network into the architecture of MCG. Ad Hoc mobile network is formed within the range of Pre-Stored Cloudlets to enable the users to get the pre-rendered game videos from the nearby users. The proposed system has THREE main layers; Cloud, Cloudlet and mobile users and the video transmission is expected to happen between these layers aided with WiMax and WiFi connection. The architecture is implemented through simulation and it is simulated to find the Response Delay which consist of Network Delay, Processing Delay, and Playout Delay. Based on the simulation results obtained, it shows that the introduction of Pre-Stored Cloudlet and Ad Hoc environment has helped to decrease the latency in game video transmission. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ad Hoc; Cloudlet; Mobile Cloud Gaming; Network Delay; Playout Delay; Processing Delay; Response Delay","Computer architecture; Image communication systems; Intelligent computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Ad Hoc; Cloudlet; Mobile clouds; Network delays; Playout delay; Processing delay; Response delays; Mobile ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Srivastava P., Khan R., A review paper on cloud computing, Int.

If the expected completion time is lower than the predictive travelling time within the coverage area, together with the load and service characteristics, the algorithm will select WLAN instead of cellular network.

The mobile device flexibility has encouraged users to turn their mobile devices into primary hubs for storing information. This paper adopts the classical CW-Lite security models as the framework and the human behavioral patterns as the context. The selected behavioral aspects refer to mobile application and mobility, deployed as major characteristics that determine security control decisions. This proposed paper requires the application of human behavioral context on mobile phones. The solution involves the novel use of behavioral aspects to improve the security of mobile phones. Two important scenarios are incorporated: analytic hierarchy process (AHP) mobile application and AHP mobility. The proposed methodology is superior because it can detect the change in the user behavior in comparison with an intruder. The applied intelligent human behavioral context on the CW-Lite model shows the advantages of AHP in detecting the changes in the user behavior and in authenticating the identity of the main user. These advantages ensure reliability and security of the phone. © 2015 The Authors.","Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for decision making; CW-Lite security model; User authentication","Analytic hierarchy process; Authentication; Cellular telephones; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Information systems; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Social sciences; Telephone sets; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Behavioral patterns; Mobile app; Mobile applications; Security controls; Security model; User authentication; User behaviors; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Liu Z., Hong Y., Pi D., A large-scale study of web password habits of chinese network users, Journal of Software, 9, 2, pp. 293-297, (2014); Liu T., Bahl P., Chlamtac I., Mobility modeling, location tracking, and trajectory prediction in wireless atm networks, Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on, 16, 6, pp. 922-936, (1998); Bajaj R., Ranaweera S.L., Agrawal D.P., Gps: Location-tracking technology, Computer, 35, 4, pp. 92-94, (2002); Song C., Qu Z., Blumm N., Barabasi A.-L., Limits of predictability in human mobility, Science, 327, 5968, pp. 1018-1021, (2010); Phithakkitnukoon S., Horanont T., Di Lorenzo G., Shibasaki R., Ratti C., Activity-aware map: Identifying human daily activity pattern using mobile phone data, Human Behavior Understanding, Springer, pp. 14-25, (2010); Bigun J., Fierrez-Aguilar J., Ortega-Garcia J., Gonzalez-Rodriguez J., Combining biometric evidence for person authentication, Advanced Studies in Biometrics, Springer, pp. 1-18, (2005); Dinh H.T., Lee C., Niyato D., Wang P., A survey of mobile cloud computing: Architecture, applications, and approaches, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 13, 18, pp. 1587-1611, (2013); Brosso I., La Neve A., Adaptive Security Policy Using User Behavior Analysis and Human Elements of Information Security, (2012); Barnes-Holmes D., Barnes-Holmes Y., Cullinan V., Relational frame theory and skinner's verbal behavior: A possible synthesis, The Behavior Analyst, 23, 1, (2000); Shankar U., Jaeger T., Sailer R., Toward automated information-flow integrity verification for security-critical applications, NDSS, (2006); Muthukumaran D., Schiffman J., Hassan M., Sawani A., Rao V., Jaeger T., Protecting the integrity of trusted applications in mobile phone systems, Security and Communication Networks, 4, 6, pp. 633-650, (2011); Saaty T., The Analytic Hierarchy Process (Ahp) for Decision Making, (1980); Jusoh Y.Y., Chamili K., Pa N.C., Yahaya J.H., Open source software selection using an analytical hierarchy process (ahp), American Journal of Software Engineering and Applications, 3, 6, pp. 83-89, (2014); Sharma M.J., Moon I., Bae H., Analytic hierarchy process to assess and optimize distribution network, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 202, 1, pp. 256-265, (2008)","","Bordea G.","Elsevier","Intelligent Control Technology Association; Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science (SIAT-CAS); The Society of Digital Information and Wireless Communications (SDIWC)","3rd Information Systems International Conference, 2015","16 April 2015 through 18 April 2015","Shenzhen","123178","18770509","","","","English","Procedia Comput.
