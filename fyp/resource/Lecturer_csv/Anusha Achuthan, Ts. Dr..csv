This study aims to evaluate the performance of Laplace interpolation (LI) method for metal artifacts reduction (MAR) in CT images in comparison with cubic spline (CS) interpolation. Methods: In this study, the proposed MAR algorithm was developed using MATLAB platform. Firstly, the virtual sinogram was acquired from CT image using Radon transform function. Then, dual-adaptive thresholding detected and segmented the metal part within the CT sinogram. Performance of the two interpolation methods to replace the missing part of segmented sinogram were evaluated. The interpolated sinogram was reconstructed, prior to image fusion to obtain the final corrected image. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations were performed on the corrected CT images (both phantom and clinical images) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MAR technique. Results: From the findings, LI method had successfully replaced the missing data on both simple and complex thresholded sinogram as compared to CS method (p-value = 0.17). The artifact index was significantly reduced by LI method (p-value = 0.02). For qualitative analysis, the mean scores by radiologists for LI-corrected images were higher than original image and CS-corrected images. Conclusion: In conclusion, LI method for MAR produced better results as compared to CS interpolation method, as it worked more effective by successfully interpolated all the missing data within sinogram in most of the CT images. © 2022 UPM Press.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile application as an educational tool to enhance donor return and improve hemoglobin levels after deferral. Materials and methods - This was an interventional study involving 382 blood donors who were deferred for low hemoglobin. The donors were divided equally into two groups: a control group and the intervention group. The control group received standard management for low hemoglobin deferral, which includes a short counseling session and a 1-month course of oral iron therapy. The intervention group used a mobile application in addition to standard management. The primary endpoint was the number of blood donors who returned during the 7 months of follow-up. The secondary endpoints were the hemoglobin increment at the first visit after the donors' deferral. Results - The return rate was higher in the intervention group, with 81.2% of the donors returning in the 7 months of follow-up compared to 66% of the control group (p<0.001). Male and female donors had mean hemoglobin increments of 1.0 g/dL and 0.7 g/dL, respectively, in the intervention group, compared to decrements of 0.2 g/dL and 0.4 g/dL, respectively, in the control group (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed a significant association between intervention method, education level and donation status on donor return (p=0.015, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively). Discussion - Higher return rate and greater hemoglobin increase in the interventional group could be attributed to features in the mobile application. Repeat donors had the highest odds of returning to donate, followed by those with a tertiary level of education, and those given the mobile application. This study showed that a mobile application was effective in enhancing donor return and increasing hemoglobin level among deferred blood donors on their first return. © 2022 Edizioni SIMTI.

If not timely and properly diagnosed, the probability of it becoming malignant is high. Therefore, accurate segmentation of brain tumors at an initial stage is essential for quantifying the brain tumor structures. Many automatic and semi-automatic approaches such as machine learning and deep learning have been explored for brain structure segmentation. However, these approaches suffer mainly from high dependency on the large training datasets and computation burden. To resolve these issues, we proposed an unsupervised brain tumor sub-regions segmentation approach, termed Dominant Grey Level based PSO Clustering. This segmentation approach utilizes dominant grey levels to provide automatic centroids initialization to the Particle Swarm optimization method to perform the segmentation of brain tumor sub-regions. The sensitivity to unwanted artifacts and random cluster initialization is greatly reduced for the proposed approach. Furthermore, using a dominant grey level to enhance the quality of initial candidate solutions of the PSO population improves the convergence speed of particles toward an optimal solution and prevents traping into local optima. The whole approach is evaluated on 30 volumes of MRI images acquired from the BRATS 2019 dataset and attained a Dice score of 0.865, 0.822, and 0.803 for the whole, core, and enhancing tumor regions respectively. The quantitative results are also compared with the standard K-Means and conventional PSO methods and some other recently published studies which report a promising segmentation efficiency in term of Dice score and Jaccard index. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Brain tumor; Clustering; Magnetic resonance imaging; Particle swarm optimization; Segmentation","Brain; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; K-means clustering; Large dataset; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Tumors; Automatic approaches; Brain tumors; Causes of death; Clusterings; Gray-level; Human being; Multi-modal; Segmentation; Semi-automatics; Sub-regions; Magnetic resonance imaging","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/USM/03/1)","Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with Project Code: FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/USM/03/1.","Wadhwa A., Bhardwaj A., Verma V.S., A review on brain tumor segmentation of MRI images, Magn Reson Imaging, 61, pp. 247-259, (2019); Saman S., Jamjala S., Survey on brain tumor segmentation and feature extraction of MR images, Int J Multimed Inf Retr, (2018); Bakas S., Et al., Advancing the cancer genome atlas glioma MRI collections with expert segmentation labels and radiomic features, Sci Data, 4, pp. 1-13, (2017); Dubey Y.K., Mushrif M.M., FCM clustering algorithms for segmentation of brain MR images, Adv Fuzzy Syst, (2016); Valverde S., Et al., Automated tissue segmentation of MR brain images in the presence of white matter lesions, Med Image Anal, 35, pp. 446-457, (2017); Zhan T., Et al., A glioma segmentation method using cotraining and superpixel-based spatial and clinical constraints, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 57113-57122, (2018); Sun J., Peng Y., Guo Y., Li D., Segmentation of the multimodal brain tumor image used the multi-pathway architecture method based on 3D FCN, Neurocomputing, 423, (2020); Zhang J., Jiang Z., Dong J., Hou Y., Liu B., Attention gate ResU-Net for automatic MRI brain tumor segmentation, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 58533-58545, (2020); Zhou Z., He Z., Shi M., Du J., Chen D., 3D dense connectivity network with atrous convolutional feature pyramid for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging of human heads, Comput Biol Med, 121, (2020); Silva C.A., Pinto A., Pereira S., Lopes A., Multi-Stage Deep Layer Aggregation for Brain Tumor Segmentation.

Cerebrovascular disease develops when blood arteries in the brain are compromised, resulting in severe brain injuries such as ischemic stroke, brain hemorrhages, and many more. Early detection enables patients to obtain more effective treatment before becoming critically unwell. Due to the superior efficiency and accuracy compared to manual segmentation and other computer-assisted diagnosis procedures, deep learning algorithms have been extensively deployed in brain vascular segmentation. This study examined current articles on deep learning-based brain vascular segmentation, which examined the proposed methodologies, particularly the network architectures, and determined the model trend. We evaluated challenges and crucial factors associated with the application of deep learning to brain vascular segmentation, as well as future research prospects. This paper will assist researchers in developing more sophisticated and robust models in the future to develop deep learning solutions.  © 2013 IEEE.","Brain vessel segmentation; convolutional neural network; deep learning; magnetic resonance angiogram","Blood vessels; Computer aided diagnosis; Deep neural networks; Learning algorithms; Network architecture; Patient treatment; Blood-vessel segmentations; Brain injury; Brain vessel segmentation; Brain vessels; Cerebrovascular disease; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Magnetic resonance angiogram; Vascular segmentations; Vessel segmentation; Magnetic resonance","","","","","","","Fang M.C., Perraillon M.C., Ghosh K., Cutler D.M., Rosen A.B., Trends in stroke rates, risk, and outcomes in the United States, 1988 to 2008, Amer.

In brain MR images, the hippocampus is observed as a gray matter structure that often exhibits very weak or unclear boundary definitions at some fragments of its’ boundary. The unclear boundaries even cause the medical experts to misjudge the hippocampus boundary, especially at the head and tail. In this research, an automated segmentation approach, termed as Assembled and Weighted Coherent Point Drift is investigated to delineate the hippocampus accurately. Evaluations on public datasets produced an average Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.8050, which appears better, in comparison to several other hippocampus segmentation approaches, especially against the well-known software program called Freesurfer. The study also revealed that the accuracy of the proposed segmentation approach seems on par with other various state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019","Brain structures; Level set; Registration; Segmentation","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/CIPPT/6315060)","This work was supported by a Short Term Grant awarded by Universiti Sains Malaysia (304/CIPPT/6315060).

This feature is integrated to formulate a new level set based active contour model that addresses the segmentation of regions with highly similar intensities in medical images, which do not have clear boundaries between them. In the first phase of this research, the strength of wavelet transform is adapted to formulate a statistical feature, named as wavelet energy. The second phase of this work is dedicated to formulate a new level set based active contour model that is suitable for segmenting regions without clear boundaries and exhibits intensity inhomogeneity within the region. The proposed segmentation method is named wavelet energy guided level set based active contour. Experiments are conducted using medical images focusing on the neck and bladder regions to validate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able to segment the region of interest in close correspondence with the manual delineation by the radiologists. ©2009 IEEE.","Level set; Medical image segmentation; Wavelet","Biomedical engineering; Digital image storage; Level measurement; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Active contour model; Active contours; Intensity inhomogeneity; Level Set; Medical image segmentation; Medical images; Region of interest; Second phase; Segmentation methods; Statistical features; Wavelet energy; Wavelet-based Feature; Image segmentation","","","","","","","Aujol J.F., Aubert G., Blanc-Feraud L., Wavelet-based Level Set Evolution for Classification of Textured Images, IEEE Transactions in Image Processing, 12, 12, pp. 1634-1641, (2003); Brieva J., Gonzalez E., Gonzalez F., Bousse A., Bellanger J., A Level Set Method for Vessel Segmentation in Coronary Angiography, Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology 27th Annual Conference, pp. 6348-6351, (2005); Caselles V., Kimmel R., Sapiro G., Geodesic Active Contours, International Journal of Computer Vision, 22, 1, pp. 61-79, (1997); Chan T.F., Sandberg B.Y., Vese L.A., Active Contours Without Edges for Vector-Valued Images, Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, 11, pp. 130-141, (2000); Chan T.F., Vese L.A., Active Contours Without Edges, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 10, 2, pp. 266-277, (2001); Duda R.O., Hart P.E., Stork D.G., Pattern Classification; Malladi R., Sethian J.A., Vemuri B.C., Shape Modeling With Front Propagation: A Level Set Approach, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 17, 2, pp. 158-175, (1995); Mallat S.G., A Theory for Multiresolution Signal Decomposition: The Wavelet Representation, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 11, 7, pp. 674-693, (1989); Osher S., Sethian J.A., Fronts Propagating With Curvature Dependent Speed: Algorithms based on Hamilton-Jacobi Formulation, Journal of Computational Physics, 79, pp. 12-49, (1988); Paragios N., Geodesic Active Regions and Level Set Methods: Contributions and Applications in Artificial Vision, (2000); Randen T., Husoy J.H., Filtering for Texture Classification: A Comparative Study, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 21, 4, pp. 291-310, (1999); Sandberg B.Y., Chan T.F., Vese L.A., A Level-Set and Gabor based Active Contour Algorithm for Segmenting Textured Images, (2002); Unser M., Texture Classification and Segmentation using Wavelet Frames, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 4, pp. 1549-1560","A.

A comparative study of two different sinogram interpolation methods for metal artefact reduction in CT images is presented. The metal part of the sinogram was determined and removed by thresholding technique. The missing part of the metal trace on the sinogram was interpolated by two interpolation methods which were cubic spline and Laplace interpolation. Both methods were applied to the selected CT images of different metal geometry and complexity. The effectiveness of both interpolation methods was compared. The results showed Laplace interpolation method produced the better results of gap filling as compared to cubic spline interpolation. But, it produces lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. © 2018 IEEE","Computed tomography; Metal artefact reduction; Sinogram interpolation","Biomedical engineering; Computerized tomography; Laplace transforms; Metals; Signal to noise ratio; Splines; Trace elements; Comparative studies; Cubic-spline interpolation; Interpolation method; Laplace interpolation; Metal artefacts; Metal geometry; Sinograms; Thresholding techniques; Interpolation","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/CIPPT/ 811344)","This research was supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) under the Research University (RUI) Grant (1001/CIPPT/ 811344).","Barret J.F., Keat N., Artefacts in CT: Recognition and Avoidance, RadioGraphics, 24, pp. 1679-1691, (2004); Boas F.E., Fleischmann D., Evaluation of Two Iterative Techniques for Reducing Metal Artifacts in Computed Tomography, Radiology, 259, 3, pp. 894-902, (2011); Gjesteby L., Man B.D., Jin Y., Paganetti H., Verburg J., Giantsoudi D., Wang G., Metal Artifact Reduction in CT: Where Are We After Four Decades?, IEEE Access, 4, pp. 5826-5849, (2016); Meyer E., Raupach R., Lell M., Schmidt B., Kachelriebeta M., Normalized metal artifact reduction (NMAR) in computed tomography, Medical Physics, 37, 10, pp. 5482-5493, (2010); Abdoli M., Ay M.R., Ahmadian A., Zaidi H., A virtual sinogram method to reduce dental metallic implant artefacts in computed tomography-based attenuation correction for PET, Nuclear Medicine Communications, 31, 1, pp. 22-31, (2010); Bruyant P.P., Sau J., Mallet J., Streak Artifact Reduction in Filtered Backprojection Using A Level Line-Based Interpolation Method, J.

This study aims to estimate pediatric dose adapted to specific size. This retrospective study involved pediatric population aged 0-12 y. SSDE was derived from scanner reported volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), based on individual effective diameter (Deff) with corresponding size correction factors. The correlations of Deff with other associated factors such as age, exposure setting, CTDIvol and SSDE were also studied. The average Deff of Malaysian pediatric was smaller than reference phantom size (confidence interval, CI = 0.28, mean = 14.79) and (CI = 0.51, mean = 16.33) for head and abdomen, respectively. These have led to underestimation of pediatric dose as SSDE was higher than displayed CTDIvol. The percentage differences were statistically significant (p <. 001) ranged from 0 to 17% and 37 to 60% for head and abdominal CT, respectively. In conclusion, the clinical implementation of SSDE in pediatric CT imaging is highly relevant to reduce radiation risk. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

Generating a diffusion tractograph from raw MRI data involves multiple layers of processes. Each set of processes that produces a particular analysis is called a pipeline. An extensive collection of software tools have been developed over the years for each layer of tractograph generation, giving researchers the freedom to choose the tools of their preference for different processes. However, this has resulted in the establishment of various pipelines aimed towards the same task, and depending upon an analysis, one pipeline may be more suitable than the other. This creates a hurdle for the clinical application of the DTI tools, as the clinicians and neuroscience researchers are not usually conversant with the technical aspects of the DTI tools. This study proposes an automated decision model for selection of tractography pipelines that will allow researchers and clinicians to select best of the possible DTI pipelines for a particular Analysis. © 2022 IEEE.","Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI); Fuzzy Logic; Pipeline; Tractography; Workflows","Diffusion; Fuzzy logic; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pipelines; Tensors; Conceptual frameworks; Diffusion tensor imaging; Fuzzy-Logic; Imaging tools; In-vivo; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Multiple layers; Tractography; White matter; Work-flows; Diffusion tensor imaging","","","","","Kementerian Pengajian Tinggi, Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/USM/03/1)","This study is sponsored by Kementerian Pengajian Tinggi, Malaysia and Universiti Sains Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), grant# FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/USM/03/1.","Walls H.A., Upthegrove W.R., Theory of liquid diffusion phenomena, Acta Metallurgica, 12, 5, pp. 461-471, (1964); Mukherjee P., Berman J.I., Chung S.W., Hess C.P., Henry R.G., Diffusion Tensor MR Imaging and Fiber Tractography: Theoretic Underpinnings, AJNR, 29, 4, pp. 632-641, (2008); Moseley M.E., Et al., Diffusion-weighted MR imaging of anisotropic water diffusion in cat central nervous system, Radiology, 176, 2, pp. 439-445, (1990); Douek P., Turner R., Pekar J., Patronas N., Bihan D.L., MR Color Mapping of Myelin Fiber Orientation, JCAT, 15, 6, pp. 923-929, (1991); Beaulieu C., The basis of anisotropic water diffusion in the nervous system-A technical review, NMR in Biomed, 15, 78, pp. 435-455, (2002); Pierpaoli C., Jezzard P., Basser P.J., Barnett A., Chiro G.D., Diffusion tensor MR imaging of the human brain, Radiology, 201, 3, pp. 637-648, (1996); Song S.-K., Sun S.-W., Ramsbottom M.J., Chang C., Russell J., Cross A.H., Dysmyelination Revealed through MRI as Increased Radial (but Unchanged Axial) Diffusion of Water, NeuroImage, 17, 3, pp. 1429-1436, (2002); Hagmann P., Jonasson L., Maeder P., Thiran J.-P., Wedeen V.J., Meuli R., Understanding Diffusion MR Imaging Techniques: From Scalar Diffusion-weighted Imaging to Diffusion Tensor Imaging and beyond, RadioGraphics, 26, 1, pp. S205-S223, (2006); Dell'Acqua F., Tournier J., Reconstructing fiber orientations with diffusion MRI, NMR Biomed, (2017); Le Bihan D., Breton E., In vivo diffusion imaging by nuclear magnetic resonance, Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences.

White matter hyperintensity is one of the most commonly reported neuroimaging markers of CSVD and is linked with an increased risk of future stroke and vascular dementia. Recent attention has focused on the search of CSVD biomarkers. The objective of this study is to explore the potential of fractal dimension as a vascular neuroimaging marker in asymptomatic CSVD with low WMH burden. Df is an index that measures the complexity of a self-similar and irregular structure such as circle of Willis and its tributaries. This exploratory cross-sectional study involved 22 neurologically asymptomatic adult subjects (42 ± 12 years old; 68% female) with low to moderate 10-year cardiovascular disease risk prediction score (QRISK2 score) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA) brain scan. Based on the MRI findings, subjects were divided into two groups: subjects with low WMH burden and no WMH burden, (WMH+; n = 8) and (WMH−; n = 14) respectively. Maximum intensity projection image was constructed from the 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MRA. The complexity of the CoW and its tributaries observed in the MIP image was characterised using Df. The Df of the CoW and its tributaries, i.e., Df (w) was significantly lower in the WMH+ group (1.5172 ± 0.0248) as compared to WMH− (1.5653 ± 0.0304, p = 0.001). There was a significant inverse relationship between the QRISK2 risk score and Df (w), (rs = −.656, p = 0.001). Df (w) is a promising, non-invasive vascular neuroimaging marker for asymptomatic CSVD with WMH. Further study with multi-centre and long-term follow-up is warranted to explore its potential as a biomarker in CSVD and correlation with clinical sequalae of CSVD. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Biomarkers; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fractals; Humans; Male; Neuroimaging; biological marker; cerebrovascular disease; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; female; fractal analysis; human; male; neuroimaging","","Biomarkers, ","","","Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, HUSM","The authors would like to acknowledge Dr Muhammad Hakimi Mohd Rashid, Amanina Ahmad Safri and Mazira Mohamad Ghazali for their contributions in this study.

Despite a progress on its key pathophysiological bases and general acceptance of key terms from neuroimaging findings as observed on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), key questions on CSVD remain elusive. Enhanced relationships and reliable lesion studies, such as white matter tractography using diffusion-based MRI (dMRI) are necessary in order to improve the assessment of white matter architecture and connectivity in CSVD. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography is an application of dMRI that provides data that can be used to non-invasively appraise the brain white matter connections via fiber tracking and enable visualization of individual patient-specific white matter fiber tracts to reflect the extent of CSVD-associated white matter damage. However, due to a lack of standardization on various sets of software or image pipeline processing utilized in this technique that driven mostly from research setting, interpreting the findings remain contentious, especially to inform an improved diagnosis and/or prognosis of CSVD for routine clinical use. In this minireview, we highlight the advances in DTI pipeline processing and the prospect of this DTI metrics as potential imaging biomarker for CSVD, even for subclinical CSVD in at-risk individuals. © The Author(s) 2022.

Histogram Equalization (HE) approaches have been commonly deployed to overcome the above-listed problems, apart from improving image contrast. Nevertheless, the resulting images retrieved after undergoing these approaches are often affected by undesired artifacts, unnatural looks, and unpleasant washed-out effects. As such, this study introduces a new approach called Adaptive Clip Limit Tile Size Histogram Equalization (ACLTSHE). The ACLTSHE initially assigns the optimum clip limit (CL) and tile size minimum or maximum values. Then, a new fitness function called DataSignal is deployed to produce a set of non-dominated solutions by adaptively computing the optimum CL value. The performance of the proposed ACLTSHE approach was assessed and compared with conventional Clip Limit HE (CLHE) and several state-of-the-art approaches, such as Dynamic Clipped HE (DCLHE), Iterated Adaptive Entropy Clip Limit HE (IAECHE), Mean and Variance Sub-image HE (MVSIHE), and Adaptive Entropy Index HE (AEIHE). The outcomes were assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively by using six evaluation metrics, Discrete Entropy (DE), Absolute Mean Brightness Error (AMBE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Contrast Improvement Index (CII), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Structure Similarity Index (SSI) and Standard Deviation (SD). The quantitative evaluation of three dataset images (Pasadena-houses 2000, faces 1999, and BraTS 2019) verified that the proposed approach outperformed the compared approaches in terms of improved DE, enhanced contrast, and highlighted local details without losing the original image structures.  © 2013 IEEE.","histogram clip limit; histogram entropy; Histogram equalization-based technique; tile size","Data acquisition; Entropy; Equalizers; Graphic methods; Image enhancement; Luminance; Mean square error; Signal to noise ratio; Discrete entropy; Frequency-domain analysis; Histogram clip limit; Histogram entropy; Histogram equalization-based technique; Histogram equalizations; Image contrasts; Index; Nonhomogeneous medium; Tile size; Frequency domain analysis","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work was supported in part by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under Grant 203.CIPPT.6711724, and in part by University Sains Malaysia.","Suganya P., Gayathri S., Mohanapriya N., Survey on image enhancement techniques, Int.

These three planes are integrated as the input streams for the Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet). The main objective of including the input patches from triplanar views is to enrich the ConvNet with more context information to aid in the classification of liver tumor. The input patches are extracted from liver Computed Tomography (CT) dataset using center pixel of interests from the triplanar views. These patches are fed into the proposed Triplanar ConvNet. Pilot experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of using triplanar views in comparisons with single-view from axial plane. The preliminary results achieved in this study revealed that triplanar approach yield better results than using patches only from single-view. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Convolutional neural network; Liver tumor segmentation; Triplanar","Classification (of information); Computer vision; Computerized tomography; Convolution; Neural networks; Robotics; Context information; Convolutional neural network; Coronal planes; Liver tumor segmentations; Pilot experiment; Pilot studies; Pixel of interests; Triplanar; Tumors","","","","","","","Lecun Y., Bottou L., Bengio Y., Haffner P., Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition, Proc.

The concept of assembled point set is introduced, which is a combination of the available training point sets into a single data space that represents its distribution. Non-rigid Coherent Point Drift is then adapted to register the assembled point set with a randomly chosen base model for hippocampus localization. The primary focus of this work is on the computational intensiveness of the localization approach, in which the proposed localization approach using assembled point set is compared with an existing groupwise non-rigid Coherent Point Drift (GCPD) approach. The computation intensiveness of the proposed approach grows at a quadratic rate as compared with GCPD that grows at a cubic rate. The proposed approach is validated with hippocampus localization task using 40-datasets. The Root Mean Square (RMS) distance between the approximated hippocampus locations and the ground truth is within an acceptable average of 0.6957-mm. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","hippocampus; localization; point set registration","Intelligent systems; Coherent point drifts; Computational intensiveness; hippocampus; localization; Point-set registrations; Quadratic rates; Registration methods; Root Mean Square; Geometry","","","","","","","Dempster A., Laird N., Rubin D., Maximum likelihood estimation from incomplete data via the em algorithm, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 39, pp. 1-38, (1977); Myronenko A., Song X., Point set registration: Coherent point drift, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 32, 12, pp. 2262-2275, (2010); Rasoulian A., Rohling R., Abolmaesumi P., Group-wise registration of point sets for statistical shape models, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 31, 11, pp. 2025-2034, (2012); Shattuck D.W., Mirza M., Adisetiyo V., Hojatkashani C., Salamon G., Narr K.L., Poldrack R.A., Bilder R.M., Toga A.W., Construction of a 3d probabilistic atlas of human cortical structures, NeuroImage, 39, 3, pp. 1064-1080, (2008); Bailleul J., Ruan S., Constans J.M., Statistical shape model-based segmentation of brain mri images, 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, EMBS 2007, pp. 5255-5258, (2007); Canny J., A computational approach to edge detection, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, PAMI-8, 6, pp. 679-698, (1986); Joseph J., Warton C., Jacobson S.W., Jacobson J.L., Molteno C.D., Eicher A., Marais P., Phillips O.R., Narr K.L., Meintjes E.M., Three-dimensional surface deformation-based shape analysis of hippocampus and caudate nucleus in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, Human Brain Mapping, (2012); Lu X., Luo S., The application of watersnakes algorithm in segmentation of the hippocampus from brain MR image, LNCS, 4987, pp. 277-286, (2008); Cabezas M., Oliver A., Llado X., Freixenet J., Cuadra M.B., A review of atlas-based segmentation for magnetic resonance brain images, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 104, 3, pp. 158-177, (2011); Sonka M., Hlavac V., Boyle R., Image Processing, Analysis, and Machine Vision, (1999); Balafar M.A., Ramli A.R., Saripan M.I., Mashohor S., Review of brain mri image segmentation methods, Artificial Intelligence Review, 33, pp. 261-274, (2010); Amenta N., Bern M., Kamvysselis M., A new voronoi-based surface reconstruction algorithm, Proceedings of the 25th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, SIGGRAPH 1998, pp. 415-421, (1998); Duta N., Sonka M., Segmentation and Interpretation of MR Brain Images Using an Improved Knowledge- Based Active Shape Model, LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, 1230, pp. 375-380, (1997); Duta N., Sonka M., Segmentation and interpretation of mr brain images: An improved active shape model, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 17, 6, pp. 1049-1062, (1998); Colliot O., Camara O., Bloch I., Integration of fuzzy spatial relations in deformable models: Application to brain mri segmentation, Pattern Recognition, 39, 8, pp. 1401-1414, (2006); Nempont O., Atif J., Angelini E.D., Bloch I., Combining radiometric and spatial structural information in a new metric for minimal surface segmentation, LNCS, 4584, pp. 283-295, (2007); Coupe P., Manjon J.V., Fonov V., Pruessner J., Robles M., Collins D.L., Patch-based segmentation using expert priors: Application to hippocampus and ventricle segmentation, NeuroImage, 54, 2, pp. 940-954, (2011); Yushkevich P.A., Piven J., Hazlett H.C., Smith R.G., Ho S., Gee J.C., Gerig G., User-guided 3d active contour segmentation of anatomical structures: Significantly improved efficiency and reliability, NeuroImage, 31, 3, pp. 1116-1128, (2006); Besl P.J., McKay H.D., A method for registration of 3d shapes, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 14, 2, pp. 239-256, (1992); Khallaghi S., Et al., Registration of a statistical shape model of the lumbar spine to 3D ultrasound images, LNCS, 6362, pp. 68-75, (2010); Heimann T., Meinzer H., Statistical shape models for 3d medical image segmentation: A review, Medical Image Analysis, 13, 4, pp. 543-563, (2009); Cootes T.F., Taylor C.J., Cooper D.H., Graham J., Training models of shape from sets of examples, Proc.

Lack of a distinct image attributes that separate adjacent structures often hinders the accuracy of the segmentation. Therefore, researches have been directed to infer prior knowledge about the possible shape and spatial location to promote accurate segmentation. Realizing the importance of prior information, this focused review aims to introduce brain structures segmentation from the perspective of how the prior information has been utilized in the segmentation methods. A critical analysis on the methodology of the brain segmentation approaches, its’ advantages and issues pertaining to these methods has been discussed in detail. This review also provides an insight to the current happenings and future directions in brain structure segmentation. © 2018 UPM Press.

Recently, a drastic increase in the number of brain disorders has been noted. This has indirectly led to an increased demand for automated brain segmentation solutions to assist medical experts in early diagnosis and treatment interventions. This paper aims to present a critical review of the recent trend in segmentation and classification methods for brain magnetic resonance images. Various segmentation methods ranging from simple intensity-based to high-level segmentation approaches such as machine learning, metaheuristic, deep learning, and hybridization are included in the present review. Common issues, advantages, and disadvantages of brain image segmentation methods are also discussed to provide a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of existing methods. From this review, it is found that deep learning-based and hybrid-based metaheuristic approaches are more efficient for the reliable segmentation of brain tumors. However, these methods fall behind in terms of computation and memory complexity. © 2021 by the authors.

The intensity similarity has causes the hippocampus to have weak or fuzzy boundaries. With this main challenge being demonstrated by hippocampus, a segmentation method that relies on image information alone may not produce accurate segmentation results. Therefore, it is needed an assimilation of prior information such as shape and spatial information into existing segmentation method to produce the expected segmentation. Previous studies has widely integrated prior information into segmentation methods. However, the prior information has been utilized through a global manner integration, and this does not reflect the real scenario during clinical delineation. Therefore, in this paper, a locally integrated prior information into a level set model is presented. This work utilizes a mean shape model to provide automatic initialization for level set evolution, and has been integrated as prior information into the level set model. The local integration of edge based information and prior information has been implemented through an edge weighting map that decides at voxel level which information need to be observed during a level set evolution. The edge weighting map shows which corresponding voxels having sufficient edge information.

In this work, we adapt a feature computed from wavelet transform called wavelet energy to represent the region information. The wavelet energy is embedded into a level set model to formulate the segmentation model called wavelet energy-guided level set-based active contour (WELSAC). The WELSAC model is evaluated using several synthetic and CT images focusing on tumour cases, which contain regions demonstrating the characteristics of intra-region intensity variations and having high similarity in intensity distributions with the adjacent regions. The obtained results show that the proposed WELSAC model is able to segment regions of interest in close correspondence with the manual delineation provided by the medical experts and to provide a solution for tumour detection. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Level set; Medical image segmentation; Wavelet","Algorithms; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Normal Distribution; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thyroid Neoplasms; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Computerized tomography; Digital image storage; Medical imaging; Tumors; Wavelet transforms; Active contours; Computed Tomography; CT Image; Intensity distribution; Intensity variations; Level Set; Level-set model; Medical experts; Medical image segmentation; Region information; Regions of interest; Segmentation methods; Tumour detection; Wavelet energy; article; bladder tumor; body regions; computer assisted tomography; computer model; controlled study; histogram; human; image analysis; level set based active contour model; priority journal; wavelet energy guided level set based active contour model; algorithm; bladder tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted tomography; normal distribution; pathology; procedures; radiography; sensitivity and specificity; thyroid tumor; Image segmentation","","","","","3D Visualisation of Tumour and Risk Structures, (1001/PKOMP/817001); Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work was supported by the Universiti Sains Malaysia's Research University grant titled “Delineation and 3D Visualisation of Tumour and Risk Structures (Grant no: 1001/PKOMP/817001 )”.

The exergames may provide enjoyable experiences that could motivate people to participate and continue playing the game play, while also exercising at the same time. Methods: This article presents a treasure hunt-based walking exergames on android platform with the implementation of intelligence-based image recognition. The exergame, termed USM ExerHunt uses images of Universiti Sains Malaysia buildings as the hints. The participant of the game supposes to find a building shown in the hint, and once reaching the destination captures the image of the building. Then, the application will calculate the total steps taken and calories burnt by the participant using an implementation of accelerometer from the mobile phone. Results: The developed USM ExerHunt application is able to achieve accurate image recognition of USM building, with the accuracy rate of 92%. Besides that, the application is capable of calculating the number of total steps and calories burnt after an exercise routine is completed. Conclusion: This android application has shown a proof of concept in incorporating machine intelligence into an exergame application, with pilot study within the USM community. © 2019 UPM Press.

In recent years, various methods of medical image segmentation have been employed depending on the type of tissues, anatomy of object of interest and imaging modality being used. In this paper, a novel problem specific segmentation method is proposed to detect secondary structures in medical images incorporating wavelet transform and watershed transformation. The proposed method consists of 5 stages: wavelet transformation, inter scale linking, feature calculation and clustering, morphological processing and watershed transformation. This paper presents the proposed method and preliminary results tested using Computed Tomography (CT) images of human anatomy.
