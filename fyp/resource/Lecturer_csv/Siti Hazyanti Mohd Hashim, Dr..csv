An individual who had suffered a stroke may have problems executing dual cognitive task. Rehabilitation can help to improve the function of dual cognitive tasking. Games have been used for rehabilitation intensely. Virtual reality games have been acknowledged to assist the stroke patient in the rehabilitation process. However, stroke rehabilitations require special virtual reality game design for the patient to perform the dual cognitive task. A study has been conducted to determine the criteria and components that are directed for dual cognitive task for patients with stroke. The information was gathered through literature review and expert opinion from both the game experts, rehabilitation physicians and therapists. This paper will discuss the development of the virtual reality game incorporating dual cognitive task for stroke rehabilitation based on the principles and elements that has been identified. The focus of the study is to develop a virtual reality game on dual cognitive task for stroke patients that combine all the game elements, game type, virtual reality environment and also game theory for dual cognitive task rehabilitation. The adoption of the correct rehabilitation elements and principles in the design and development of a virtual reality game addressing dual cognitive task will be able to assist the stroke patient in the rehabilitation process. © 2019 Association fo rComputing Machinery.","Dual cognitive task; Serious game; Stroke rehabilitation; Virtual reality","Augmented reality; Game theory; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Serious games; Virtual reality; Cognitive skill; Cognitive task; Design and Development; Expert opinion; Literature reviews; Stroke patients; Stroke rehabilitation; Virtual-reality environment; Electronic medical equipment","","","","","","","Tieri G., Morone G., Paolucci S., Iosa M., Virtual reality in cognitive and motor rehabilitation: Facts, fiction and fallacies, Expert Rev.

Due to the brain pathology, a stroke patient may have difficulties in performing dual cognitive task. In the field of serious games for rehabilitation one of the technique is the use of virtual reality. However, through our literature search, we found no virtual reality games designed specifically for dual cognitive task. Dual cognitive task rehabilitation requires a game design that is suitable for problems that are related to dual cognitive task and must also be suitable for stroke patient. Therefore, this paper will discuss the proposed framework design of a virtual reality game for dual cognitive task challenge for stroke rehabilitation. In order to design the framework, some known literature has been summarized. The focus of the study are performing dual cognitive task in stroke patients, virtual reality game and its challenges, game design element, game genre, virtual reality environment and also game theory for dual cognitive task rehabilitation. The expected result is the framework of virtual reality game on dual cognitive task for stroke rehabilitation. © 2018 IEEE.","dual cognitive task; framework; serious game; stroke rehabilitation; virtual reality","Electronic medical equipment; Game theory; Industrial electronics; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Virtual reality; Brain pathologies; Cognitive skill; Cognitive task; framework; Framework designs; Literature search; Stroke rehabilitation; Virtual-reality environment; Serious games","","","","","Research Management Centre; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (057/2017, 600-IRMI/DANA 5/3 BESTARI); Universiti Teknologi MARA, UiTM","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors are grateful for the support given from the Research Management Centre (RMC), Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) and the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for funding the research project through the BESTARI grant [Ref no: 600-IRMI/DANA 5/3 BESTARI (057/2017)]","Lohse K., Shirzad N., Verster A., Hodges N., Van Der Loos M.H.F., Video games and rehabilitation: Using design principles to enhance engagement in physical therapy, J.
