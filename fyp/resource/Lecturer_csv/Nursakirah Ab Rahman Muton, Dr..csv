Saving images of receipts is a method of digitizing receipts, but managing (sorting, searching, editing, deleting, adding annotations) them is rather tedious. This paper analyzes current receipt managing applications in the market, and their approach in digitizing receipts. Other researchers' methods were also analyzed, and a pipeline to achieve receipt digitization is deduced. With a pipeline of various methods in each step, the strengths and flaws of each method were addressed. Improvements to those methods and to the overall usability of a receipt management system were proposed. The proposed methods were then developed into a usable product application. © 2023 University of Bahrain.

We will introduce a cross-cultural code-switching framework in a virtual setting and develop propositions to explain how GVT members attempt to switch their communicative behaviour based on two theoretical lenses: Giles communication accommodation theory (1973) and Hall high-context and low-context theory (1976). This paper offers several propositions to illuminate the process of code-switching behaviours among GVT members during the socialisation process and explores how these behaviours help develop swift trust. It considers whether developing swift trust is possible and, if so, how.

We propose using the ARCS motivational model as the theoretical model because motivation is one of the most important aspects of the mentoring process. We review the historical perspective of ARCS, discuss the previous works that used ARCS, and propose the design of our e-mentoring system. The ARCS model was developed by John M.

This factor creates many challenges, in particular with a group of people who are strangers to one another and has no historical background of working together. The main purpose of this exploratory study is to highlight the challenges of swift trust formation within GVTs and to present the teamwork-related issues involved in globally distributed collaboration. We conducted two focus group interviews to develop a preliminary understanding of the phenomenon based on the Tuckman and Jensen (1997) teamwork model. This data yielded important insights into the initial process of teamwork and swift trust formation. Based on our findings, team members experienced key challenges such as delayed communication due to time differences, misunderstanding of tasks assigned, technical problems with the use of varied collaborative tools, work attitude, lack of responsibility and motivation among teams and difficulty to establish relationships. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

This paper discusses the system design of an e-mentoring system for Malaysian orphans, called MyMentorMentee.com. The design of MyMentorMentee.com is an adaptation of Keller's ARCS Motivational model and uses its motivational elements to provide an effective mentoring experience for each session. A (attention), R (relevance), C (confidence) and S (satisfaction) are the four components of the ARCS motivational model. Keller's model provides techniques for solving the motivational problems faced by a learner during the learning process. The purpose of MyMentorMentee.com is to study how an e-mentoring system can overcome the motivational challenges faced by orphans which were identified during the preliminary study. Among these are personal issues and learning issues. The system was developed to help mentor and mentee to carry out the mentoring session using alternative (web-based) way at anytime and anywhere. The system that we have designed has 4 modules: personal profile, text messaging, mentoring schedule, and personal video chat. All modules were evaluated using quantitative and qualitative techniques.","ARCS Motivational Model; E-mentoring system; System design","E-Mentoring; Learning process; Malaysians; On-line tools; Personal profile; System development; Time-differences; Systems analysis","","","","","","","Direnzo M.S., Linnehana F., Shaoa P., Rosenberga W.L., Journal of Vocational Behavior, 2, 76, (2010); Eby L.T., Lockwood A., Journal of Vocational Behavior, 67, (2005); Jones K.W., Hardcastle V., Agnich L., A guide to Mentoring, (2007); Fellows S., The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, (2005); Bierema L.L., Merriam S.B., Innovative Higher Education, 3, 26; Ellen E.A., Heun C., Blanchard A., Journal of Vocational Behavior, 63, (2003); Keller J.M., Journal of Instructional Development, 3, 10, (1987); Keller J.M., Strategies for stimulating the motivation to learn, 8, 26, (1987); Shellnut B., Savage T., Knowlton A., Using the ARCS Model to Design Multimedia College Engineering Courses, Proceedings of Selected Research and Development Presentation at the National Convention of the Association for Educational Communications and Technology, (1998); Lai C.-H., Yang J.-C., Jheng B.-L., Chan T.-W., Ho C.-W., Liang J.-S., A Web-Based Information-Learning-Passport System Using the ARCS Model, Proceedings of the International Conference on Computers in Education, (2002); Mills R.J., Sorensen N., Kids College TM 2004: An Implementation of the ARCS Model of Motivational Design, (2004); Bae Y.-K., Lim J.-S., Lee T.-W., Mobile Learning System Using the ARCS Strategies, Proceedings of the Advanced Learning, (2005); Kocaman-Karoglu A.K.E., Ozden M.Y., ARCS Motivation Model in the Design and Development of a Blended Course, Proceedings of World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications, (2008); Ismail N., Ismail Z., Journal of Edupres, 1, (2011)","F.

However, few studies have highlighted what exact behaviors enable GVTs to share knowledge effectively. Based on a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 22 respondents from various multinational corporations (MNCs) in Malaysia, we answer the following overarching research question: Why do high context members switch their communicative behaviors amongst foreign team members within global virtual teams? Our study provides detailed narratives of high-context team members becoming the behavioral “switchers” to collaborate and share knowledge with their foreign team members effectively. Our study defines and clarifies the concept of cross-cultural code-switching as a key behavior reflecting effective cross-cultural performance when accommodating foreign team members’ communicative behaviours by adopting (1) directness in speech, (2) openness during knowledge sharing, and (3) task-oriented aims. This study addresses several gaps in the field of cross-cultural management by extending Hall’s (1976) theoretical lens on high-context and low-context cultures, Molinsky’s (2007) cross-cultural code-switching concept in the context of the virtual work structure, and the criterion space surrounding cross cultural performance. © The Author(s) 2022.","code-switching; global virtual teams; high-context; knowledge sharing; Malaysia; qualitative","","","","","","","","Adair W.L., Brett J.M., The negotiation dance: time, culture, and behavioral sequences in negotiation, Organization Science, 16, 1, pp. 33-51, (2005); Ahmad F., Barner-Rasmussen W., False foe?

For multinational corporations (MNCs), it is deemed timely for organizations to capitalize on the IoT environment since it is grounded by the ""Global Village"" phenomenon. The main research question is: How do GVTs capitalize on IoT to achieve high performing teams, and what is the cultural effect of IoT on swift trust formation in a GVT? In this paper, we develop propositions to explain the different types of tools and services potentially used by GVTs and how these tools can impact the way quick trust is formulated among GVT members when they collaborate at a distance.
