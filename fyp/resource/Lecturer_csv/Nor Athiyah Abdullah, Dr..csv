A survey instrument was developed from the findings of earlier focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, which were based on the adaptation and adoption of previous studies, especially Kollmuss and Agyeman’s 2002 Model of Pro-Environmental Behaviour and a modified Knowledge-Attitude-Practises Model. Three hundred ninety-three respondent samples from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Universiti Putra Malaysia, and Universiti Sains Malaysia were analysed for their insights regarding their vision of a Zero-Waste Campus using the Structural Equation Modelling approach. The results show positive relationships between the five studied variables and the proposed hypotheses. Knowledge and attitudes serve as moderating variables, enhancing the strength of the causal effects of the related relationships. As the results show good significance, proper planning for integrating the studied variables and the proposed zero-waste campus framework can be used by university management, other institutions, or national-level agencies to develop an environment-specific plan to promote zero-waste, pro-environmental behaviour. © 2023 by the authors.","KAP; pro-environmental behaviour; Structural Equation Modelling; university; zero-waste","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (LRGS MRUN/F2/01/2019/2/2)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for a long-term research project (Project Code: LRGS MRUN/F2/01/2019/2/2).","Abubakar I.R., Maniruzzaman K.M., Dano U.L., AlShihri F.S., AlShammari M.S., Ahmed S.M.S., Al-Gehlani W.A.G., Alrawaf T.I., Environmental Sustainability Impacts of Solid Waste Management Practices in the Global South, Int.

Despite its widespread use, the high percentage of students who do not use it raises concerns among institutions in developed countries who have spent considerable time and money developing it. As a result, it is critical to comprehend the variables that affect students' decisions to take MOOCs. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for assessing MOOC acceptance among students in Nigerian higher education institution, and it expands on the technology acceptance model (TAM). Five constructs and two moderators are identified and hypothesized and synthesis of related prior literature: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, reputation, subjective norm, facilitating condition, and technology awareness.

It includes the entire assessment process from the examinees, teachers, institutions, examination agencies, and the public. E-assessment systems have been used extensively in educational and non-educational settings worldwide because of their significant impact on assessment to both the institutions and students. Electronic assessment systems have many significant advantages over conventional paper-pencil-based approaches, like reducing production cost, automatic marking, and fair grading. Other benefits include the ability to conduct adaptive testing, an increase in the frequency of assessment, a large number of people could be examined, low staff requirements during the assessment, and the ability to improve the quality of the evaluation. Text, images, audio, video, and interactive virtual environments in an e-assessment system are all feasible. Nevertheless, given all these advantages, some examinees expressed negative views about electronic assessment in our study due to fear or lack of familiarity with assessment technology and lack of information on e-assessment methods. Despite the increased adoption of e-assessment in higher education and organizations, the examinees' attitudes and opinions need to be studied to implement the system successfully. In an e-assessment environment, several factors account for the evaluation of the system quality. These factors can be categorized into three dimensions: technical, educational, and economical. However, based on literature reviewed, limited studies attempted to map these quality factors to determine user satisfaction with an e-assessment system. This scarcity of e-assessment satisfaction studies is the gap the study intends to fill. Furthermore, this study's findings would help provide practical and theoretical implications for educational institutions and organizations. This study is among the first application of the Delone and McLean information system success model to predict user satisfaction with computer-based assessment in a developing, African country. © 2021, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Hence, this paper proposed a genetic algorithm-based approach to automate group formation based on student demography to assign students to their academic advisors. The genetic algorithm (GA) will optimize the group formation of students with a balanced number of nationalities, races, and genders. Also, this paper examines the user acceptance of the proposed genetic algorithm-based application to automate group formation using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework. The survey aims to study the impact of independent and moderating variables on dependent variables. The result proved that all the independent variables, Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), and Facilitating Condition (FC), have a positive impact on the dependent variable, Behavioral Intention (BI). In contrast, the moderating variable Experience (EX) and Voluntariness of Use (VU) have a negative impact on Behavioral Intention (BI). Thus, this paper concludes that the proposed application can increase the performance and efficiency of group formation and automatically assign students to academic advisors. However, respondents are reluctant and not ready to use the system. Thus, training and workshops can be conducted to introduce and train the users to utilize the system. Future works can be done where the application of the proposed genetic algorithm-based system can be further expanded to different academic purposes such as team formation for group assignment and team member selection for competition. © 2023, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

In Nigeria, the CBT centres are public and private examination centres equipped to conduct the annual matriculation examination computer-based test. The study aims to investigate and empirically test the role of quality factors in predicting CBT satisfaction. The study also intends to test a mediator to explore further how some quality factors influence the examinee's satisfaction. The research framework is based on the updated information system success model (ISSM) and is validated using a survey incorporating system quality, service quality, question content, the cost-effectiveness of CBT services, and CBT centre service satisfaction.

The mediating effect of Facebook adoption between the determinants of Facebook adoption and the performance of the SMEs was examined. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive framework was built using the technology – organisation–environment framework integrated with the resource-based view theory. Data were collected from 165 SME decision-makers using an online survey. The hypothesised relationships were tested using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Findings: Facebook adoption exerted a positive impact on the financial and non-financial performance of the SMEs. The important determinants of Facebook adoption were relative advantage, perceived risks, top management support, organisational readiness and government support. The mediating effect of Facebook adoption between these determinants and financial and non-financial performance was confirmed. Research limitations/implications: The findings contribute to better insight into the determinants of Facebook adoption and its impact on the financial and non-financial performance of SMEs. The findings can inspire and guide SMEs on adopting Facebook as a marketing strategy to improve performance and reduce failure rates. Originality/value: The findings confirm the potential of adopting Facebook for enhancing the performance of SMEs. This is arguably among the first empirical studies to test the mediating effect of Facebook adoption. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Determinants; Developing countries; Facebook adoption; Performance; Service-based SMEs; Services SMEs","Decision making; Failure analysis; Finance; Least squares approximations; Marketing; Social networking (online); Determinant; Facebook; Facebook adoption; Mediating effect; Performance; Service small and medium enterprise; Service-based; Service-based small and medium enterprise; Small-and-medium enterprise; Developing countries","","","","","","","Abdullahi M.S., Jakada B.A., Kabir S., Challenges affecting the performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria, Journal of Human Capital Development (JHCD), 9, 2, pp. 21-46, (2016); Abedin B., Adoption of Facebook for customer relationship management for SMEs: exploring the underlying motivations, Strategic Customer Relationship Management in the Age of Social Media, pp. 60-71, (2015); Abubakar M.K., Patricia M.N., Samuel O.O., Totolo A., Factors affecting adoption of social media by women’s non-governmental organisations (WNGOs), International Journal of Library and Information Science, 9, 9, pp. 96-106, (2017); Adegbuyi O.A., Akinyele F., Akinyele S., Effect of social media marketing on small scale business performance in ota-metropolis, Nigeria, International Journal of Social Sciences and Management, 2, 3, pp. 275-283, (2015); Afolabi A., Ojelabi R.A., Oyeyipo O., An analysis of social media marketing of indigenous construction firms in Nigeria: a tool for sustainable growth, International Journal of Construction Supply Chain Management, 8, 2, pp. 60-72, (2018); Agwu E., An investigative analysis of factors influencing ebusiness adoption and maintenance of commercial websites in Nigeria, (2018); Ahani A., Rahim N.Z.A., Nilashi M., Forecasting social CRM adoption in SMEs: a combined SEM-neural network method, Computers in Human Behavior, 75, pp. 560-578, (2017); Ainin S., Parveen F., Moghavvemi S., Jaafar N.I., Mohd Shuib N.L., Factors influencing the use of social media by SMEs and its performance outcomes, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 115, 3, pp. 570-588, (2015); Akuz M., Isaac O.M., Abdullahi A.I., Effect of electronic marketing on the performance of SMEs in Karu local government area, Nasarawa state of Nigeria, FUO Quarterly Journal of Contemporary Research, 8, 2, (2020); Alalwan A.A., Rana N.P., Dwivedi Y.K., Algharabat R., Social media in marketing: a review and analysis of the existing literature, Telematics and Informatics, 34, 7, pp. 1177-1190, (2017); Ali Qalati S., Li W., Ahmed N., Ali Mirani M., Khan A., Examining the factors affecting SME performance: the mediating role of social media adoption, Sustainability, 13, 1, (2021); Alsaad A., Mohamad R., Ismail N.A., The moderating role of trust in business to business electronic commerce (B2B EC) adoption, Computers in Human Behavior, 68, pp. 157-169, (2017); Alshamaila Y., Social network site usage by small- and medium-sized businesses: understanding the motivations and barriers, Modern Applied Science, 12, 3, (2018); Apulu I., Latham A., Moreton R., Factors affecting the effective utilisation and adoption of sophisticated ICT solutions: case studies of SMEs in Lagos, Nigeria, Journal of Systems and Information Technology, 13, 2, pp. 125-143, (2011); Awa H.O., Ukoha O., Emecheta B.C., Liu S., Using T-O-E theoretical framework to study the adoption of ERP solution, Cogent Business and Management, 3, 1, (2016); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Burton-Jones A., Gallivan M.J., Toward a deeper understanding of system usage in organizations: a multilevel perspective, MIS Quarterly, 31, 4, pp. 657-679, (2007); Buwule R.S., (2019); Cant M.C., Wiid J.A., The use of traditional marketing tools by SMEs in an emerging economy: a South African perspective, Problems and Perspectives in Management, 14, 1, (2016); Cao Y., Ajjan H., Hong P., Le T., Using social media for competitive business outcomes, Journal of Advances in Management Research, 15, 2, pp. 211-235, (2018); Chang S.E., Shen W.-C., Liu A.Y., Why mobile users trust smartphone social networking services?

There are places for support, entertainment, information, knowledge sharing and even a way to interact with millions of people all over the world. An e-health community serves as a medium for patients and survivors to support each other and to improve their lives as patients need more emotional support to struggle with their disease. Technical accuracy alone is not enough to make online communities successful-they must also focus on the social aspects. Previous studies have highlighted the role of sociability in many research areas. This paper will discuss social software narrowing to online communities; summarize the sociability aspects that have been applied in various research areas and particularly in the e-health community. © 2010 IEEE.","E-health; Online community; Sociability","Economic and social effects; Health; Information technology; Social aspects; Ehealth; Knowledge-sharing; Online communities; Online community; Research areas; Sociability; Social interactions; Social software; Online systems","","","","","","","Conner M.L., The value of communities in organizational growth and employee development, The 2000 E-Learning Conference: Accelerating Performance at Internet Speed, (2000); Preece J., Online Communities: Designing Usability, Supporting Sociability, (2000); Maloney-Krichmar D., Preece J., The meaning of an online health community in the lives of its members: Roles, relationships and group dynamics, Technology and Society, 2002 (ISTAS '02) 2002 International Symposium on, pp. 20-27, (2002); Maloney-Krichmar D., Preece J., A multilevel analysis of sociability, usability, and community dynamics in an online health community, ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 12, pp. 201-232, (2005); Weiss J.B., Lorenzi N.M., Synthesizing community wisdom: A model for sharing cancer-related resources through social networking and collaborative partnerships, American Medical Informatics Association 2008 Annual Symposium Proceedings, pp. 793-797, (2008); Preece J., Maloney-Krichmar D., Abras C., History of online communities, Encyclopedia of Community: from Village to Virtual World, pp. 1023-1027, (2003); Demiris G., The diffusion of virtual communities in healthcare : Concepts and challenges, Patient Education and Counselling, pp. 178-188, (2005); Villarica H., Bailey N., The Internet and Cancer: How Online Social Networking Is Revolutionizing Cancer Health Care, (2009); Ambrozek J., Cothrel J., Online communities in business: Past progress, future directions, 7th International Conference on Virtual Communities, (2004); Rutter J., Smith G., Ritual aspects of CMC sociability, Esprit i3 Workshop on Ethnographic Studies in Real and Virtual Communities, pp. 113-122, (1999); Pan Y.C., Kuo L., Lee J.J., Sociability design guidelines for the online gaming community: Role play and reciprocity, Online Communities and Social Comput., HCII 2007, pp. 426-434, (2007); Barab S.A., Makinster J.G., Moore J.A., Cunningham D.J., Designing and building an online community: The struggle to support sociability in the inquiry learning forum, Educational Technology Research and Development, 49, pp. 71-96, (2001); Keenan A., Shiri A., Sociability and Social Interaction on Social Networking Websites, 58, pp. 438-450, (2009); Abedin B., Daneshgar F., Operationalizing off-task sociability of asynchronous computer supported collaborative learning, Communications of the International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA), 1, pp. 152-158, (2008); Lau A.Y.S., Kwok T.M.Y., Social features in online communities for healthcare consumers - A review, Online Communities, pp. 682-689, (2009); Li D.Z.X., Mao W., Wang F.-Y., Online communities : A social computing perspective, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 355-365, (2008); Meier A., Lyons E.J., Frydman G., Forlenza M., Rimer B.K., How cancer survivors provide support on cancer-related internet mailing lists, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 9, (2007); Preece J., Online communities : Researching sociability and usability in hard to reach populations, AJIS Special Issue, pp. 146-151, (2004); EHealth in 2010: Realising A Knowledge-based Approach to Healthcare in the EU Challenges for the Ambient Care System, (2003)","N.

This study explores the underlying behavioral context of disaster information sharing by Twitter users. We conducted a web survey with 999 respondents in Japan to determine what makes people retweet disaster information in disaster situations. As a result of factor analysis, four factors were identified from 36 questions, namely: 1) Willingness to provide relevant and updated information because the information is believable, 2) Want people to know the information they perceive as important, 3) “Retweeter” subjective feelings and interests, and 4) Want to get feedback and alert other people. The results suggest that two of the factors influenced different groups of people in the community differently; however, everybody can play their role to reduce the negative impact of social media used for future disaster. Based on the findings, we discuss practical and design implications of social media use during disasters. © 2017 Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.

A qualitative approach is employed to identify the factors influencing the campus community’s awareness and participation in solid waste management (SWM). Perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, opinions, and ideas of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) campus community members are explored in focus group discussions (FGD) to determine the main factors influencing their zero-waste pro-environmental behaviour (PEB). The in-depth interview (IDI) is used to learn more about the university campus community’s perspectives on the themes defined by the FGD. The instruments were developed based on the adaption and adoption of previous studies, especially in reference to Kollmuss and Agyeman’s 2002 Model of Pro-Environmental Behaviour and a modified Knowledge-Attitude-Practices model. The findings show that environmental goals, environmental education, personal waste-related experience, environmental policy, environmental self-awareness, reinforcement contingencies, community engagement, social responsibilities, exemplary leadership, and social media influence the campus community’s zero-waste PEB. A framework based on an adaptation of Kollmuss and Agyeman’s model of pro-environmental behaviour is proposed to promote sustainable pro-environmental behaviour towards a Zero-Waste Campus. © 2023 by the authors.","persuasive technology; pro-environmental behaviour; social media; waste minimisation; zero-waste campus","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (LRGS MRUN/F2/01/2019/2/2)","This work was supported by Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Long Term Research Project (Project Code: LRGS MRUN/F2/01/2019/2/2).","Kaza S., Yao L., Bhada-Tata P., van Woerden F., What a Waste 2.0: A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050, What a Waste 2.0: A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050, (2018); Yang H., Ma M., Thompson J.R., Flower R.J., Waste management, informal recycling, environmental pollution and public health, J.

This paper aims to investigate the factors determining user satisfaction with a summative e-assessment system in Nigeria from the examinees' point of view, and to address the challenges and problems faced during the e-assessment. Therefore, the research adopts a qualitative approach (by interview) to provide a further understanding of the main factors which affect user satisfaction with eassessment. Secondly, to map those identified issues with a corresponding objective and subjective aspects of satisfaction. As a result, this could set the stage right for future studies on resolving issues and enhancing the e-assessment satisfaction. This study showed that the satisfaction of examinees with e-assessment would be influence by service quality, system quality, and user's computer experience. In contrast, information quality was found to be an insignificant determinant of user satisfaction with summative e-assessment. Past studies mostly address the relationship between these factors and user satisfaction quantitatively. This study reveals that Information System Success Model is the most suited underlying theory that could fit the case of e-assessment satisfaction. © 2005 JATIT and LLS.","Computer Experience; Service Quality; Summative E-Assessment; System Quality; User Satisfaction","","","","","","","","Ayo C.

This is one of the early attempts to explicate and describe the patterns of published articles of PEB in the field of Computer Science. From the first article traced in 1976 until 2019, the total numbers of published documents related to pro-environmental behaviour across all disciplines are 2276. However, only 97 documents were found in the field of Computer Science. It is noted that the integration of PEB in Computer Science has indicated an exponential increase in annual publication rate and this trend appears to be evident in developed countries. Specifically, the analysis of productivity according to country/region, institution and funding sponsor suggested that the research landscapes in particularly in Malaysia are paying attention to the intersection of PEB and Computer Sciences. The exploration in the type of publication, source of publication, keyword and language analysis provided the orientation, status and trends of the topic and potential hints to future studies in this field. Overall, progressive trends in publications suggest that the integration of the topic would be continuously published and studied in Malaysia as well as among the international community. © 2020 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.","Behavioural; Bibliometric; Scopus; Sustainability; Trends","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; European Commission, EC; Australian Research Council, ARC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Stichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der Materie, FOM; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Funding text 1: Focusing on published document in PEB, the leading institutions are the University of Queensland, University of Groningen, Universidad de Sonora, University of Leeds and Sejong University.

As the result of the factor analyses, we extracted 3 factors on user’s action towards spread message which are: 1) Desire to spread the retweet messages as it is considered important, 2) Mark the retweet messages as favorite using Twitter “Favorite” function, and 3) Search for further information about the content of the retweet messages. Then, we further analyze why user decides to perform retweet. The results reveal that user has desire to spread the message which they think is important and the reason why they retweet it is because of the need to retweet, interesting tweet content and the tweet user. The results presented in this paper provide an understanding on user behavior of information diffusion, with the aim to reduce the spread of misinformation using Twitter during emergency situation. © 2015 Information Processing Society of Japan.","Decision making; Emergency; Misinformation; Retweet; Twitter","","","","","","","","Peary B.D.M., Shaw R., Takeuchi Y., Utilization of Social Media in the East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and its Effectiveness, Journal of Natural Disaster Science, 34, 1, pp. 3-18, (2012); Turoff M., Van De Walle B., Hiltz S.R., Emergency Response Information System Past, Present and Future, Information Systems for Emergency Management, 16, pp. 369-387, (2010); UK Government: Using Social Media in Emergencies: Smart Practices; White C., Plotnick L., Kushma J., Hiltz S.R., Turoff M., An online social network for emergency management, Int.

However, there appears to be a paucity of research on students' satisfaction with the facilities and services of computer-based assessment (CBA) centers in higher education institutions, especially when the centers are equipped and staffed by third-party vendors. The CBA centers are public and private examination centers in developing countries that administer computer-based tests for higher education and other external organizations. Although satisfaction with the services and facilities is essential, it has been asserted that having the feeling of trust when using the CBA is even more critical to the students. Trust is essential for the success of any technological advancement, especially in the field of education. Any educational technology that lacks the stakeholders' trust, regardless of how effective it may be, is doomed to fail to be adopted on a large scale. However, limited studies have investigated how students' trust in the CBA affects their satisfaction. Therefore, this study aims to model and analyze the roles of CBA center service satisfaction and perceived trust in the CBA in attaining overall satisfaction by exploring their roles in influencing student satisfaction. A research framework based on the updated information system success model (ISSM) is validated using a survey incorporating system quality, service quality, question content, the cost-effectiveness of CBA services, CBA center service satisfaction, and perceived trust. A total of 459 survey responses collected from three higher education institutions in Nigeria were analyzed using structural equation modelling. As a result, the findings confirmed that students' satisfaction with services at the CBA centers is a mediator between service quality, system quality, and overall satisfaction with CBA. The correlation between CBA centre service satisfaction and overall CBA satisfaction was also found to be the strongest, indicating that student satisfaction with the services and facilities at the CBA centre is crucial. CBA center managers and institutions can utilize the findings from this study to successfully implement the CBA. In enhancing students‘ CBA satisfaction, higher education institutions should consider focusing on the necessary steps towards improving the conditions of the CBA centers in terms of infrastructure and services rendered. Meanwhile, to increase student satisfaction besides enhancing the system and service quality and cost-effectiveness, institutions should seriously consider promoting the CBA to the students by highlighting the personal impact of the CBA in terms of trust by improving the quality and features of the CBA. © The Authors.","CBA center; CBA quality factors; CBA satisfaction; CBA trust; Computer-based assessment","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (301/PKOMP/6315397)","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support received from Universiti Sains Malaysia grant (301/PKOMP/6315397).","Adebayo O.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies should be utilised to advance the tourism sector. This has been proven viable by many researchers globally. However, there is currently a lack of information on the utilisation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies in the Malaysian tourism industry. Crimes such as pickpocketing are also a common occurrence in Kuala Lumpur; hence a way of alerting the tourists of crime hotspots is important, as such events will negatively impact their experience visiting Malaysia. The three main issues that will be focused on in this research are improving the walking navigation of tourists visiting Kuala Lumpur, improving overall tourist safety, and improving the current marketing methods of DBKL (Kuala Lumpur City Hall). This research aims to study the feasibility of integrating the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies into the Malaysian tourism industry to solve the issues mentioned. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group®","Augmented Reality; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Malaysian tourism; Mobile application; Tourism industry","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2020/SS0/USM/02/4)","Acknowledgment to “Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme Project with Project Code: FRGS/1/2020/SS0/USM/02/4”","(2019); Jazdi N., Cyber Physical Systems in the Context of Industry 4.0, pp. 1-4, (2014); Li Guoping, Hou Yun, Wu Aizhi, Fourth Industrial Revolution: Technological Drivers, Impacts and Coping Methods, Chinese Geographical Science, 27, pp. 626-637, (2017); Mohamad E., Et al., Review on Implementation of Industry 4.0 Globally and Preparing Malaysia for Fourth Industrial Revolution, Proceedings of the 28th Design Engineering and Systems Division Conference of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, (2018); Azer Ilyani, Contribution of Economic Sectors to Malaysian GDP, Regional Conference on Science, Technology and Social Sciences (RCSTSS 2014), pp. 183-189, (2016); Raza Syed Ali, Et al., Tourism Development and Environmental Degradation in the United States: Evidence from Wavelet-Based Analysis, Current Issues in Tourism, (2017); Henderson Joan, Making Cities More Walkable for Tourists: A View from Singapore’s Streets, International Journal of Tourism Cities, 4, 3, pp. 285-297, (2018); Marketing Strategy: of Stories Fans and Channels, (2016); Tan Chuie-Hong, Chong Xin-Wei, Ho Sin-Ban, Significance of Safety and Security Issues on Tourism Industry in Malaysia, Science International (Lahore), 29, 2, pp. 471-475, (2017); Tencent, Product and Services, (2019); Williams Meredydd, Yao Kelvin K.

After the Great East Japan Earthquake on 2011, Twitter was flooded with lots of disaster information, including misinformation that have been widely spread by retweet. Accordingly, we developed a questionnaire to investigate factors influenced people decision making to retweet disaster information they read from Twitter in disaster situations. We developed a questionnaire using brainstorming and KJ method and conducted a user survey (n = 57) to test the questionnaire items. Then, we analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and as a result, five factors derived from 38 question items which are: 1) Trustworthy information, 2) Relevance of the information during disasters, 3) Willingness to supply the information, 4) Importance of the information, and 5) Self Interest. However, there are 7 question items that need revision based on the results of the factor analysis. In this paper, we discuss the method we used to design the questionnaire and the result of the factor analyses of the questionnaire testing. © 2016 Information Processing Society of Japan.","Disaster; Information sharing; Questionnaire testing; Twitter","","","","","","","","White C., Plotnick L., Kushma J., Hiltz S.R., Turoff M., Anonline social network for emergency management, Int.

Industry 4.0 calls for transformation and effective talent development is vital in ensuring national aspirations are achieved while eliminating redundancy and ensuring consistency. As such, this study aims to understand the impact of Industry 4.0 on computer engineering-related workforce and skills development within Multinational Companies (MNCs) to Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. In this study, online questionnaires were distributed to evaluate the current and future hiring trends. The study reveals that most of the employees have positive perceptions about the industrial current practice on Industry 4.0 and identified the prospective demands on the professions that will be affected. Five significant areas of required competencies found in this study are adaptability, soft skills, software engineering, data analytics, and technical skills. The findings provide empirical evidence about current and future employment scenarios in Malaysia concerning the possible impact of Industry 4.0 on the companies and issues involved in managing the transition to Industry 4.0. Besides, the emergent skills required by workforces that are previously unaddressed in the literature were identified. Empirical evidence from the analysis contributes to shaping the educational systems of the future and helps to proactively identify specific skills shortages at an early stage. © The Author(s) 2022.","future talents;

The problem occurs nowadays is overloaded of information from social media that is spread by people and confused the other people. Current function in Twitter allows people to ‘favorite’ tweets, perform re-tweet instantly, or added their own opinion on the tweet by quote and re-tweet. It is allowed the user to report tweets, sensitive or harmful tweets, and non-interested tweet, but there are no features to identify the credibility and accuracy of those tweets. Therefore, we proposed a technical solution where a prototype was developed in a Twitter-like environment by adding crowdsource rating features. The purpose of this research is to investigate the influence of crowd-sourced rating on tweets for decision making for the credibility of information spreading. A pilot study was conducted to a small real sample group of 31 respondents to know the respondent’s feedback on the prototype. The pilot study shows that most of the respondents were agree with the capabilities of crowdsourcing rating feature in identifying the accuracy and credibility of that information. The prototype design and the questionnaires have to be modified again, but the rating features was still the same. This prototype then redistributed to 139 respondents, and the respondents need to answer the control scenario part, prototype part, and the questionnaires. Control scenario design was similar like a prototype but without adding the crowdsource rating features. The questionnaires have divided into four parts, which is demographic information, social media usage, evaluation of the prototype, and evaluation on the usability of the prototype. Overall, the result from the questionnaires answer was a positive result where most of the respondents were agreed that crowdsourced rating feature was useful and helped them to identify and determine the accuracy and credibility of the information and help to prevent from spreading the misinformation in social media. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Crowdsourcing; Information overload; Information spreading; Social media; Twitter","Behavioral research; Decision making; Intelligent computing; Social networking (online); Surveys; Current function; Demographic information; Information overloads; Information spreading; Prototype designs; Social media; Technical solutions; Twitter; Crowdsourcing","","","","","","","Abdullah N.A., Nishioka D., Murayama Y., Questionnaire testing: Identifying Twitter user’s information sharing behaviour during disaster, J.

The Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11th, 2011 caused severe damage to the northern coast of the main island in Japan. We report our support activities in Iwate prefecture as well as our findings and experiences. We call disaster communications in this chapter. disaster communications. Following the requests from many organizations and groups of people, we started our support for the disaster area with a few of us in the department of Software and Information Science, Iwate Prefectural University ten days after the disaster. Through our support activities we came across an interesting issue concerning collaboration with people from heterogeneous backgrounds. Disagreements and distrust happened quite easily. We found that trust plays an important role in such communications. In our chapter, we introduce disaster communications as an area for research and practice as well as our trials on the recovery phase after the emergency response. © 2016 by IGI Global.

This research seeks to give an extended model investigating the intention to use MOOCs based on students at public universities in northwestern Nigeria. The extended TAM model was tested via PLS structural equation modelling using data collected from 451 students at public universities in northwestern Nigeria. The research findings indicated that the proposed extended model delivers a 72.0% descriptive effect. The creative technology acceptance TAM model establishes a strong signal for the effects of PU, PR, PEOU, SN, and TA on intentions to practice MOOCs technology among students in Nigerian public universities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The outcomes present practical and theoretical implications that MOOC developers can use to justify why MOOCs are not high within public universities in Northern-western Nigeria. The findings also indicated that PU, PEOU, PR SN, and TA significantly impact students' intention to use MOOCs. The research has provided insight into extended TAM in Nigerian learning environments to discover the issues influencing students' intention to use MOOCs. Dissimilar to preceding empirical reviews, this research broadly investigated the intention to participate in MOOCs of public University students in northwestern Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic, delivering crucial discoveries and commendations for impending research openings.
