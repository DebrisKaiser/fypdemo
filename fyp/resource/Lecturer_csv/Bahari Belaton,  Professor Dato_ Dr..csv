Because of all points in ICP-based method are processed at each iteration to find their correspondences, the method's performance is bounded by this constraint. This paper introduces an alternative ICP-based method by considering only subset of points whose boundaries are determined by the context of the inputs. These subsets can be used to sufficiently derive spatial mapping of point's correspondences between the source and target set even if points have been missing or modified slightly in the target set. A brief description of this method is followed by a comparative analysis of its performance against two ICP-based methods, followed by some experiments on its subset's sensitivity and robustness against noise. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.","Correspondences; Expectation Maximization (EM); Iterative Closest Point (ICP); Registration error; Subset; Transformation","Geometry; Image registration; Information science; Set theory; Correspondences; Expectation Maximization; Iterative closest point; Registration error; Subset; Transformation; Iterative methods","","","","","","","Myronenko A., Song X., Point Set Registration: Coherent Point Drift, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 32, 12, pp. 2262-2275, (2010); Besl P.J., McKay N.D., A Method for Registration of 3-D Shapes, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 14, 2, pp. 239-256, (1992); Chen Y., Medioni G., Object Modeling by Registration of Multiple Range Images, Image and Vision Computing, 10, 3, pp. 145-155, (1992); Ezra E., Sharir M., Efrat A., On the performance of the ICP algorithm, Computational Geometry, 41, pp. 77-93, (2008); Jost T., Hugli H., A Multi-Resolution ICP with Heuristic Closest Point Search for Fast and Robust 3D Registration of Range Images, Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling, pp. 427-433, (2003); Zinsser T., Schmidt J., Niemann H., A Refined ICP Algorithm for Robust 3-D Correspondence Estimation, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, pp. 695-698, (2003); Santamaria J., Cordon O., Damas S., A comparative study of state-of-the-art evolutionary image registration methods for 3D Modeling, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 115, 9, pp. 1340-1354, (2011); Granger S., Pennec X., Multi-scale EM-ICP: A Fast and Robust Approach for Surface Registration, LNCS, 2353, pp. 418-432, (2002); Liu Y., Automatic registration of overlapping 3D point clouds using closest points, Image and Vision Computing, 24, 7, pp. 762-781, (2006); Chen J., Liao I.Y., Belaton B., Zaman M., A Neural Network-Based Registration Method for 3D Rigid Face Image, World Wide Web, (2013); Du S., Zheng N., Ying S., Liu J., Affine iterative closest point algorithm for point set registration, Pattern Recognition Letters, 31, pp. 791-799, (2010); Rusinkiewicz S., Levoy M., Efficient variants of the ICP Algorithm, Proceedings of the 3th International Conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling, pp. 1-8, (2001); Rasoulian A., Rohling R., Abolmaesumi P., Group-Wise Registration of Point Sets for Statistical Shape Models, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 31, 11, pp. 2025-2034, (2012); Gold S., Rangarajan A., Lu C.-P., Mjolsness E., New Algorithms for 2D and 3D Point Matching: Pose Estimation and Correspondence, Pattern Recognition, 31, pp. 957-964, (1997); Chui H., Rangarajan A., A new point matching algorithm for non-rigid registration, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 89, pp. 114-141, (2003); Chen J., Belaton B., An Improved Iterative Closest Point Algorithm for Rigid Point Registration, Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC), TianJin, pp. 481-485, (2013); Latecki L.J., Lakamper R., Eckhardt U., Shape descriptors for non rigid shapes with a single closed contour, Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 424-429, (2000)","","","","Malaysian Information Technology Society (MITS); Multimedia Development Corporation (MDeC); Malaysian Research Education Network (MyREN); Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic Systems (MIMOS); ICT Cluster of the National Professor's Council of Malaysia (MPN)","3rd International Visual Informatics Conference, IVIC 2013","13 November 2013 through 15 November 2013","Selangor","100560","16113349","978-331902957-3","","","English","Lect.

This has exacerbated existing network attacks including ICMPv6-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and its variant form Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) aimed at tackling security issues raised by ICMPv6-based DoS and DDoS attacks have been reviewed by researchers and a general classification of existing IDSs was proposed as anomaly-based and signature-based. However, it is incredibly hard to see the overall picture of IDSs based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques with such a classification, as there is a lack of a more detailed view of the ML approach, classifiers, feature selection techniques, datasets, and different evaluation metrics. Nevertheless, recent developments in this relatively new field have not been covered such as ML-based IDSs using flow-based traffic representation. Therefore, this article specifically reviews and classifies IDSs based on ML techniques to detect ICMPv6-based DoS and DDoS attacks as single and hybrid classifiers. In addition, blockchain applicability in Collaborative IDS (CIDS) architecture based on the ensemble framework has been proposed as a solution to one of the open challenges for ICMPv6-based DoS and DDoS attacks detection problem. Moreover, this review also provides a classification of ICMPv6 vulnerabilities to DoS and DDoS attacks which would provide a reference resource for future researchers in this domain. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first review paper specifically focusing on IDSs based on ML techniques in this domain, as well as blockchain applicability as a possible research direction has been proposed to attract researcher's focus on building ensemble learning-based IDS models.

Data analytics paved the way for a significant number of research and development in various fields including medicine and vaccine development, DNA analysis, artificial intelligence and many more. Data plays a very important role in providing the required results and helps in making critical decisions and predictions. However, ethical and legislative restrictions sometimes make it difficult for scientists to acquire data. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, data was very limited due to privacy and regulatory issues. To address data unavailability, data scientists usually leverage machine learning algorithms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to augment data from existing samples. Today, there are over 450 algorithms that are designed to re-generate or augment data in case of unavailability of the data. With many algorithms in the market, it is practically impossible to predict which algorithm best fits the problem in question, unless many algorithms are tested. In this study, we select the most common types of GAN algorithms available for image augmentation to generate samples capable of representing a whole data distribution. To test the selected models, we used two unique datasets, namely COVID-19 CT images and COVID-19 X-Ray images. Five different GAN algorithms, namely CGAN, DCGAN, f-GAN, WGAN, and CycleGAN, were selected and applied to the samples to see how each algorithm reacts to the samples. To evaluate their performances, Visual Turing Test (VTT) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) were used. The VTT result shows that a human expert can accurately distinguish between different samples that were produced. Hence, CycleGAN scored 80% in CT image dataset and 77% in X-Ray image dataset. In contrast, the FID result revealed that CycleGAN had a high convergence and therefore generated high quality and clearer images on both datasets compared to CGAN, DCGAN, f-GAN, and WGAN. This study concluded that the CycleGAN model is the best when it comes to image augmentation due to its friendliness and high convergence.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

The capability of the model to depict a new 3D face depends on the exemplar faces in the training set. Although a few 3D face databases are available to the research community and they have been used for 3D face modeling, there is little work done on rigorous statistical analysis of the models built from these databases. The common factors that are generally concerned are the size of the training set and the different choice of the examples in the training set. In this paper, a case study on USF Human ID 3D database, one of the most popular databases in the field, has been used to study the effect of these factors on the representational power.We found that: 1) the size of the training set increase, the more accurate the model can represent a new face; 2) the increase of the representational power tends to slow down in an exponential manner and achieves saturity when the number of faces is greater than 250. These findings are under assumptions that the 3D faces in the database are randomly chosen and can represent different races and gender with neutral expressions.

A few detection systems were proposed to detect these attacks based on self-generated datasets. These datasets used an unsuitable representation that depends on packets format as well as they include non-qualified features which lead to false alerts if the systems are applied in real networks. Moreover, most of the existing datasets are unavailable for other researchers’ usage due to their author’s privacy issues. The objective of this paper is benchmarking datasets of ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks to be used for the tuning, evaluations, and comparisons of any detection system of the attacks. The datasets setup is based on a real IPv6-enabled network topology and ensuring attack exposure. The proposed datasets are considered as the first labeled and publically available flow-based datasets represented using a set of flow-based features of the ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks. The requirements of good datasets have been achieved in the proposed datasets to ensure they are worthy be used by other researchers. Moreover, the datasets and their features proved their abilities to represent the attacks traffics by achieving robust and acceptable high detection accuracies as well as low false positive rate. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Dataset generation; Features extraction; Flow-based datasets; ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks; Intrusion detection","Feature extraction; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Dataset generation; DDoS Attack; Detection accuracy; False positive rates; Features extraction; Flow based; Internet control message protocols; Network topology; Denial-of-service attack","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PNAV/6313272)","This research was supported by the Short Term Research Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) No: 304/PNAV/6313272.","Conta A., Gupta M., Internet control message protocol (Icmpv6) for the internet protocol version 6 (ipv6) specification, Request for Comments, (2006); Postel J., Rfc 792: Internet control message protocol, Request for Comments, 792, (1981); Elejla O.E., Anbar M., Belaton B., Icmpv6-based dos and ddos attacks and defense mechanisms: Review, IETE Tech Rev, 34, pp. 1-18, (2016); Ard J.B., Internet protocol version six (ipv6) at uc davis: traffic analysis with a security perspective, (2012); Weber J., Wegener C., Schwenk J., Ipv6 security test laboratory,” master dissertation Department of Network and Data Security, (2013); Elejla O.E., Belaton B., Anbar M., Alnajjar A., A reference dataset for icmpv6 flooding attacks, J Eng Appl Sci, 11, 3, pp. 476-481, (2016); Lakhina A., Crovella M., Diot C., Characterization of network-wide anomalies in traffic flows, Proceedings of the 4Th ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Internet Measurement, pp. 201-206, (2004); Sperotto A., Sadre R., Pras A., Anomaly characterization in flow-based traffic time series, International Workshop on IP Operations and Management, Springer, Berlin, pp. 15-27, (2008); Strayer W.T., Lapsely D., Walsh R., Livadas C., Botnet detection based on network behavior, Botnet Detection.

Intrusion Detection systems (IDS) are a popular software to detect any possible attacks. Among the mechanisms that are used to build accurate IDSs, classification algorithms are extensively used due to their efficiency and auto-learning ability. This paper aims to evaluate classification algorithms for detecting the dangerous and popular IPv6 attacks which are ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks. A comparison between five classification algorithms namely Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Networks (NN) were conducted. The comparison was conducted using a publicly available flow-based dataset. The experimental results showed that classifiers have detected most of the included attacks with a range from 73%-85% for the true positive rate. Moreover, KNN classification algorithm has been the fastest algorithm (0.12 seconds) with the best detection accuracy (85.7%) and less false alarms (0.171). However, SVM achieved the lowest detection accuracy (73%) while NN was the slowest algorithm in training the detection model (323 seconds). © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Attacks detection; Decision tree; ICMPv6; Intrusion detection systems; IPv6; K-Nearest neighbors; Naïve bayes; Neural networks; Support vector machine","Barium compounds; Decision trees; Denial-of-service attack; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Classification algorithm; ICMPv6; Intrusion Detection Systems; IPv6; K nearest neighbor (KNN); K-nearest neighbors; K-NN classifications; True positive rates; Data mining","","","","","University of Southern Maine, USM, (1001/PKOMP/8014018)","The authors would like to thank the School of Computer Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for providing the facilities and support.

Visual Analytics (VA) is a modern visualization supported with automated processing method. The major impulse of the method lies in its ability to integrate the key component of scientific visualization and search based heuristics in the same optimization model. This paper presents a visual analytics process (VAP) adapted for UETP. The adaption involves the human context of visual analytics on timetabling data, which are typically processed computationally with local search algorithm and then visualized and interpreted by the user in order to perform problem solving with direct interactions between the primary data, processing and visualization. The three processing phases are invoked with user-driven and algorithmic-driven steering that analyses the combined effect with automatic tuning of algorithmic parameters based on constraints and the criticality of the application for the simulations is proposed. The optimal solution for the small datasets and best overall results for the medium and large datasets are experimented. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Algorithm driven steering; Examination timetabling; Interactive visualization; User-driven","Data handling; Data visualization; Heuristic methods; Intelligent computing; Optimization; Processing; Scheduling; Visualization; Algorithmic parameters; Automated processing; Direct interactions; Examination timetabling; Interactive visualizations; Local search algorithm; Optimization modeling; User driven; Problem solving","","","","","","","Ranson D., Cheng P.-H., Graphical tools for heuristic visualization, Proceedings of the 2Nd Multidisciplinary International Conference on Scheduling: Theory and Applications (MISTA), pp. 658-667, (2005); Thomas J.J., Khader A.T., Belaton B., Ken C.C., Integrated problem solving steering framework on clash reconciliation strategies for university examination timetabling problem, Neural Information Processing, pp. 297-304, (2012); Thomas J.J., Khader A.T., Belaton B., A parallel coordinates visualization for the uncapaciated examination timetabling problem, Visual Informatics: Sustaining Research and Innovations, pp. 87-98, (2011); Thomas J.J., Khader A.T., Belaton B., The perception of interaction on the university examination timetabling problem, PATAT 2010, (2010); Qu R., Burke E.K., McCollum B., Merlot L.T., Lee S.Y., A survey of search methodologies and automated system development for examination timetabling, J.

DoS and DDoS attacks that are using Internet Control Message Protocol version six (ICMPv6) messages are the most common attacks against the Internet Protocol version six (IPv6). They are common because of the necessary inclusion of the ICMPv6 protocol in any IPv6 network to work properly. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) of the Internet Protocol version four (IPv4) can run in an IPv6 environment, but they are unable to solve its security problems such as ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks due to the new characteristics of IPv6, such as Neighbour Discovery Protocol and auto-configuration addresses. Therefore, a number of IDSs have been either exclusively proposed to detect IPv6 attacks or extended from existing IPv4 IDSs to support IPv6. This paper reviews and classifies the detection mechanisms of the existing IDSs which are either proposed or extended to tackle ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first review paper that explains and clarifies the problems of ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks and that classifies and criticizes the existing detection. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","DDoS; DoS; ICMPv6; IDS; Intrusion Detection System; IPv6 networks","DOS; Internet protocols; Intrusion detection; Network security; Problem solving; Auto-configuration; DDoS; Detection mechanism; Distributed denial of service attack; ICMPv6; Internet control message protocols; Intrusion Detection Systems; IPv6 networks; Denial-of-service attack","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PNAV/6313272)","This research was supported by the Short Term Research Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) No: 304/PNAV/6313272.

Histogram Equalization (HE) approaches have been commonly deployed to overcome the above-listed problems, apart from improving image contrast. Nevertheless, the resulting images retrieved after undergoing these approaches are often affected by undesired artifacts, unnatural looks, and unpleasant washed-out effects. As such, this study introduces a new approach called Adaptive Clip Limit Tile Size Histogram Equalization (ACLTSHE). The ACLTSHE initially assigns the optimum clip limit (CL) and tile size minimum or maximum values. Then, a new fitness function called DataSignal is deployed to produce a set of non-dominated solutions by adaptively computing the optimum CL value. The performance of the proposed ACLTSHE approach was assessed and compared with conventional Clip Limit HE (CLHE) and several state-of-the-art approaches, such as Dynamic Clipped HE (DCLHE), Iterated Adaptive Entropy Clip Limit HE (IAECHE), Mean and Variance Sub-image HE (MVSIHE), and Adaptive Entropy Index HE (AEIHE). The outcomes were assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively by using six evaluation metrics, Discrete Entropy (DE), Absolute Mean Brightness Error (AMBE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Contrast Improvement Index (CII), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Structure Similarity Index (SSI) and Standard Deviation (SD). The quantitative evaluation of three dataset images (Pasadena-houses 2000, faces 1999, and BraTS 2019) verified that the proposed approach outperformed the compared approaches in terms of improved DE, enhanced contrast, and highlighted local details without losing the original image structures.  © 2013 IEEE.","histogram clip limit; histogram entropy; Histogram equalization-based technique; tile size","Data acquisition; Entropy; Equalizers; Graphic methods; Image enhancement; Luminance; Mean square error; Signal to noise ratio; Discrete entropy; Frequency-domain analysis; Histogram clip limit; Histogram entropy; Histogram equalization-based technique; Histogram equalizations; Image contrasts; Index; Nonhomogeneous medium; Tile size; Frequency domain analysis","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Universiti Sains Malaysia","This work was supported in part by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under Grant 203.CIPPT.6711724, and in part by University Sains Malaysia.","Suganya P., Gayathri S., Mohanapriya N., Survey on image enhancement techniques, Int.

Visualization and steering of critical processing phases like examination clashes identification are essential for effective data analysis by examination timetabling research community. The visual analytics combined steering framework with interactive visualization techniques needs to take into account for both the inputs of the researcher (human timetabler) and the critical needs of the application including simulations and continuous visualization of significant events. In this work, we have developed an integrated problem solving environment (PSE) a computational steering mechanism for user-driven and automated steering interactions. The well sophisticated ExamViz user interface is for simulations, and analysis for critical conflict and reconciliation with visual cues. ExamViz provides the user steering control visualization over various parameters of the inputs, including the initial raw data solutions. The user are able to interact with conflicting data while the decision making algorithm in execution with visual cues to reconciliate the clashes and guide the user throughout the improvement of the solution.

The purpose of this study is to model, simulate and visualize crowd dynamics applicable to emergency situations via human-like intelligent agents governed by the rules of fuzzy-logic. At the micro level the crowd is perceived as a group of individual agents (pedestrians). During an emergency situation each agent’s goal is to evacuate through an exit. This study cohesively deploys fuzzy-logic based control mechanisms to determine the degree of emergency level pertaining to each agent in the crowd. Further, Unity based simulation and visualization models are proposed to display critical areas of the crowd during a typical evacuation process. Results justify the fact that the evacuation time taken shows significant increments proportional to the population size of the agents while the percentage of emergency level portrays quite similar trends. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

The registration is an indispensible step before distinguishing the variation among the images. Neural network (NN) has a strong learning ability from a mass unstructured point cloud even containing noisy data. Neural network has been applied to register 3D reconstructed ear data and 3D surface of bunny and to achieve the better results. Motivated by this idea, NN-based registration method for 3D rigid face image is proposed. This paper presented the proof process of obtaining rotation matrix and translation vector according to the training process of neural network. Then the measure index of registration performance was provided. The elaborate experiments were conducted on the 3D USF face database (provided by the University of South Florida) to verify the effectiveness of neural network as a registration method. Next, two comparisons were performed, one group was NN-based and ICP-based registration methods and the other group was our proposed NN-based and other NN-based registration methods. The experimental results showed that neural network is a robust and potential registration method for rigid face image registration. Furthermore, our proposed NN-based registration method is extended easily to do 2D-to-3D registration and non-rigid face registration. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","3D face registration; Alignment; Iterative Closest Point (ICP); Linear transformation; Neural network (NN); Supervised learning","Alignment; Image enhancement; Image registration; Iterative methods; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Supervised learning; 3D face registrations; Intelligent detection; Iterative closest point; Neural network (nn); Real-time video monitoring; Registration methods; Registration performance; Unstructured point clouds; Neural networks","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province, (F2012201023)","","Abche A.B., Yaacoub F., Maalouf A., Karam E., Image registration based on neural network and Fourier transform, The 28th IEEE EMBS Annual International Conference, pp. 4803-4806, (2006); Alyuz N., Gokberk B., Dibeklioglu H., Akarun L., Component-based registration with curvature descriptors for expression insensitive 3d face recognition, The 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition, pp. 1-6, (2008); Besl P.J., McKay N.D., A method for registration of 3-D shapes, IEEE Transaction Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, 14, 2, pp. 239-256, (1992); Blanz V., Vetter T., A morphable model for the synthesis of 3D faces, The 26th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques, pp. 187-194, (1999); Blanz V., Vetter T., Face recognition based on fitting a 3D morphable model, IEEE Transactions Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, 25, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2003); Cui Y., Pei J., Tang G., Luk W.-S., Jiang D., Hua M., Finding email correspondents in online social networks, World Wide Web, 16, 2, pp. 195-218, (2013); Dahm N., Gao Y., A Novel Pose Invariant Face Recognition Approach Using a 2D-3D Searching Strategy, The 20th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, pp. 3967-3970, (2010); Duffner S., Face image analysis with Convolutional neural networks, (2007); Duffner S., Garcia C., Robust Face Alignment Using Convolutional Neural Networks, The 3th International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications, vol. 2, pp. 30-37, (2008); Gokberk B., Irfanoglu M.O., Akarun L., 3D shape-based face representation and feature extraction for face recognition, Image and Vision Computing, 24, 8, pp. 857-869, (2006); Horaud R., Forbes F., Yguel M., Dewaele G., Zhang J., Rigid and articulated point registration with expectation conditional maxinization, IEEE Transactions Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, 33, 3, pp. 587-602, (2011); Jian B., Vemuri B.C., Robust point set registration using Gaussian mixture models, IEEE Transactions Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, 33, 8, pp. 1633-1645, (2011); Kumar S., Neural Networks: A Classroom Approach, Tata McGraw-Hill Education, (2004); Liu L., Tang W., Buttler D., Pu C., Information monitoring on the web: a scalable solution, World Wide Web, 5, 4, pp. 263-304, (2002); Liu H., Yan J., Zhang D., Three-dimensional surface registration: a neural network strategy, Neurocomputing, 70, 1-3, pp. 597-602, (2006); Liu H., Yan J., Zhang D., A neural network strategy for 3d surface registration, The 6th international conference on Computational Science and Its Applications - Volume Part I, pp. 528-536, (2006); Padia C., Pears N., A review and characterization of ICP-based symmetry plane localisation in 3D face data, Technical Report, pp. 1-27, (2011); Pan G., Han S., Wu Z., Wang Y., Super-resolution of 3d face, The 9th European conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 389-401, (2006); Poon B., Amin M.A., Yan H., Performance evaluation and comparison of PCA Based human face recognition methods for distorted images, Int.

In this contribution, a novel approach is proposed to increase the RP of the 3D reconstruction PCA-based model by deforming a set of examples in the training dataset. By adding these deformed samples together with the original training samples we gain more RP. A 3D PCA-based model is adapted for each new input face image by deforming 3D faces in the training data set. This adapted model is used to reconstruct the 3D face shape for the given input 2D near frontal face image. Our experimental results justify that the proposed adaptive model considerably improves the RP of the conventional PCA-based model. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.","3D face reconstruction; PCA; Representational Power; Statistical facial modeling; TPS","Deformation; Face recognition; Information science; 3D face reconstruction; Facial model; PCA; Representational Power; TPS; Three dimensional","","","","","","","Atick J., Griffin P., Redlich A., Statistical approach to shape from shading: Reconstruction of three-dimensional face surfaces from single two-dimensional images, Neural Computation, 8, 6, pp. 1321-1340, (1996); Besl P., McKay H., A method for registration of 3D shapes, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 14, 2, pp. 239-256, (1992); Blanz V., Vetter T., Face recognition based on fitting a 3D morphable model, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 25, 9, pp. 1063-1074, (2003); Blanz V., Vetter T., A morphable model for the synthesis of 3D faces, Proceedings of the 26th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, SIGGRAPH 1999, pp. 187-194, (1999); Bookstein F.L., Principal warps: Thin-plate splines and the decomposition of deformations, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis AndMachine Intelligence, 11, 6, pp. 567-585, (1989); Bottino A., De Simone M., Laurentini A., Sforza C., A new 3D tool for planning plastic surgery, IEEE Transactions on Bio-medical Engineering, (2012); Brown B., Rusinkiewicz S., Non-rigid range-scan alignment using thin-plate splines, Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on 3D Data Processing, Visualization and Transmission, 3DPVT 2004, pp. 759-765, (2004); Elyan E., Ugail H., Reconstruction of 3D human facial images using partial differential equations, JCP, pp. 1-8, (2007); Fanany M.I., Ohno M., Kumazawa I., Face Reconstruction from Shading Using Smooth Projected Polygon Representation NN, Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Vision Interface, Calgary, Canada, pp. 308-313, (2002); Farkas L.G., Anthropometry of the Head and Face, (1994); Hu Y., Jiang D., Yan S., Zhang L., Automatic 3D reconstruction for face recognition, Proceedings of the Sixth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, pp. 843-848, (2004); Jiang D., Hu Y., Yan S., Zhang L., Zhang H., Gao W., Efficient 3D reconstruction for face recognition, Pattern Recogn., 38, pp. 787-798, (2005); Kemelmacher-Shlizerman I., Basri R., 3D face reconstruction from a single image using a single reference face shape, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 33, 2, pp. 394-405, (2011); Knothe R., Romdhani S., Vetter T., Combining PCA and LFA for surface reconstruction from a sparse set of control points, 7th International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, FGR 2006, pp. 637-644, (2006); Levine M.D., Yu Y., State-of-the-art of 3D facial reconstruction methods for face recognition based on a single 2D training image per person, Pattern Recogn.

To detect crimes such as credit card fraud, several single and hybrid machine learning approaches have been used. However, these approaches have significant limitations as no further investigation on different hybrid algorithms for a given dataset were studied. This research proposes and investigates seven hybrid machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities with a real word dataset. The developed hybrid models consisted of two phases, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms were used first to detect credit card fraud, then, hybrid methods were constructed based on the best single algorithm from the first phase. Our findings indicated that the hybrid model Adaboost + LGBM is the champion model as it displayed the highest performance. Future studies should focus on studying different types of hybridization and algorithms in the credit card domain. © 2022 by the authors.

Healthcare professionals present major challenges to the successful implementation of IoT for providing healthcare services. Many studies have offered important insights into IoT adoption in healthcare. Nevertheless, there is still a need to thoroughly review the effective factors of IoT adoption in a systematic manner. The purpose of this study is to accumulate existing knowledge about the factors that influence medical professionals to adopt IoT applications in the healthcare sector. This study reviews, compiles, analyzes, and systematically synthesizes the relevant data. This review employs both automatic and manual search methods to collect relevant studies from 2015 to 2021. A systematic search of the articles was carried out on nine major scientific databases: Google Scholar, Science Direct, Emerald, Wiley, PubMed, Springer, MDPI, IEEE, and Scopus. A total of 22 articles were selected as per the inclusion criteria. The findings show that TAM, TPB, TRA, and UTAUT theories are the most widely used adoption theories in these studies. Furthermore, the main perceived adoption factors of IoT applications in healthcare at the individual level are: social influence, attitude, and personal inattentiveness. The IoT adoption factors at the technology level are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, performance expectancy, and effort expectations. In addition, the main factor at the security level is perceived privacy risk. Furthermore, at the health level, the main factors are perceived severity and perceived health risk, respectively. Moreover, financial cost, and facilitating conditions are considered as the main factors at the environmental level. Physicians, patients, and health workers were among the participants who were involved in the included publications. Various types of IoT applications in existing studies are as follows: a wearable device, monitoring devices, rehabilitation devices, telehealth, behavior modification, smart city, and smart home. Most of the studies about IoT adoption were conducted in France and Pakistan in the year 2020. This systematic review identifies the essential factors that enable an understanding of the barriers and possibilities for healthcare providers to implement IoT applications. Finally, the expected influence of COVID-19 on IoT adoption in healthcare was evaluated in this study. © 2022 by the authors.","adoption factors; adoption theories; deep learning (DL); Internet of Things in healthcare; IoMT; IoT; IoT adoption; machine learning (ML); systematic review","COVID-19; Delivery of Health Care; Health Personnel; Humans; Telemedicine; Wearable Electronic Devices; Automation; Deep learning; Health care; Health risks; Medical computing; Adoption factors; Adoption theory; Deep learning; Internet of thing in healthcare; IoMT; IoT; IoT adoption; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Systematic Review; electronic device; health care delivery; health care personnel; human; procedures; telemedicine; Internet of things","","","","","Division of Research & Innovation, Universiti Sains Malaysia; Office of Research & Sponsored Programs of Abu Dhabi University; School of Computer Sciences","This research is funded by the Office of Research & Sponsored Programs of Abu Dhabi University, United Arab Emirates, and the School of Computer Sciences, and Division of Research & Innovation, Universiti Sains Malaysia.","Chiuchisan I., Costin H.N., Geman O., Adopting the internet of things technologies in health care systems, Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference and Exposition on Electrical and Power Engineering (EPE), pp. 532-535; Mani V., Manickam P., Alotaibi Y., Alghamdi S., Khalaf O.I., Hyperledger Healthchain: Patient-Centric IPFS-Based Storage of Health Records, Electronics, 10, (2021); Keikhosrokiani P., Mustaffa N., Zakaria N., Success factors in developing iHeart as a patient-centric healthcare system: A multi-group analysis, Telemat.

The latest threat Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) was originated by the United States Air Force in 2006 by Colonel Greg Rattray. APT is constantly ravaging industries and governments, which causes severe damages including data loss, espionage, sabotage, leak, or forceful pay of ransom money to the attackers. This study introduces a new model built on Adversarial Tactics Techniques and Common Knowledge (ATTCK) matrix for detecting APT attack. This is to identify the APT on the first potential victim when the attackers use credential dumping technique. Strange Behavior Inspection Model incorporating several models investigates and monitors APT behavioral features in the CPU, RAM, windows registry, and file systems proposed to detect APT Attack at the first potential victim machine. The Strange Behavior Inspection (SBI) Model proposed in this paper is designed to detect the attack before being developed to more advanced phases. The results of this study are presented at four levels:1- random access memory, 2-central processing unit, 3- windows registry, and 4- file systems. This study proposes a unique model as evidence to detect APT attacks before any other techniques are used. The proposed model reduces the detection time from nine-months to 2.7 minutes.  © 2013 IEEE.","APT; ATT&CK; Attacker; dump; exploit; Mimikatz and credential dumping","Data handling; File organization; Behavioral features; Common knowledge; Cybercriminals; Inspection modeling; Processing units; Random access memory; United States Air Force; Windows registry; Random access storage","","","","","","","Ghazi-Tehrani A.K., Regulating cyber space: An examination of US-China relations, Ph.D. Dissertation, Univ.

Our solution requires neither implicit surface definition nor the use of non-simple rays. Points are simply treated as disk primitives. To prevent shading artifacts due to the use of disk representation, each ray is intersected with a few disks, and the intersection results interpolated. Further, to speed up the ray-object search, we adapt the KD-tree with bounding spheres structure applied in the QSplat point splatting system (Rusinkiewicz and Levoy 2000). Our prototype implementation is generally competitive compared to previous point set ray tracers. Further it demonstrates considerable speedup over a point set ray tracer based on a conventional KD-tree, while producing images with acceptable ray-traced quality.","Point primitives; Ray tracing","Computer graphics; Disks (structural components); Elementary particle sources; Geometry; Software prototyping; Disk representation; Fast ray tracing; Implicit surfaces; Kd-tree; Point primitives; Point set; Point-based geometry; Prototype implementations; Speed-ups; Splatting; Ray tracing","","","","","","","Adamson A., Alexa M., Ray Tracing Point Set Surfaces, SMI'03:Proceedings of the Shape Modeling International 2003, (2003); Coconu L., Hege H.-C., Hardware-Accelerated Point-Based Rendering of Complex Scenes,  Eurographics Workshop on Rendering, pp. 43-52, (2002); Havran V., Heuristic Ray Shooting Algorithms, (2001); Levoy M., Pulli K., Curless B., Rusinkiewicz S., Koller D., Pereira L., Ginzton M., Anderson S., Davis J., Ginsberg J., Shade J., Fulk D., The Digital Michelangelo Project: 3D Scanning of Large Statues, Proc.

Lance Spitzner of the Honeynet Project introduced the concept of honeypots. A honeypot is in essence a decoy server, which has no real or strategic value and is only setup to attract crackers towards it. The idea is to trap the crackers and learn cracking techniques from them. Rapid increase in unauthorized intrusions over the Internet provides a great motivation to explore honeypots at a greater depth. We will provide analysis on TCP based denial of service attack carried out on Symantec Decoy Server based honeypot. These results highlight the importance of honeypot as a tool of learning and preventing future intrusions. © 2005 IEEE.","Denial of service attack; Honeypots; Symantec Decoy Server","Computer crime; Internet; Network protocols; Servers; Denial of service attack; Honeypots; Intrusions; Symantec Decoy Server; Packet networks","","","","","","","Lau F., Stuart R.H., Smith M.H., Trajovic L., Distributed Denial of Service Attacks, (2000); Bakhtiar Nizamani A., Network Forensics using Honeynets, Final Year Degree, pp. 15-16, (2003); Spitzner L., Honeypots - Definitions and Value of Honeypots, (2002); Spitzner L., Frequently Asked Questions, (2003); Moore D., Shannon C., Brown J., Code-Red: A case study on the spread and victims of an Internet worm, (2002); Cumulative Patch for IIS, (2001); Steps for Recovering from a UNIX or NT System Compromise, (2000)","A.B.

Tikhonov regularization is a popular method that incorporates prior information towards providing the existence of closed-form solutions which we obtain as a result of applying PCA, in order to solve the ill-posed problem. The common factors that generally affect Tikhonov regularization are the regularization matrix, the number of feature points, regularization parameters and noise. In this study we report our findings on how various factors influence the reconstruction accuracy based on a case study performed on the USF Human ID 3D database. Further, a statistical comparison between two Tikhonov regularization matrices viz., the identity matrix and the diagonal matrix comprising of the eigenvalues (eigenvalue matrix), has been performed. We found that, the reconstruction error can be reduced significantly by using the later one. Finally our study aids to determine the most feasible interval in conjunction with optimal regularization parameters which would lead towards achieving accurate and plausible solutions. © SCRG Publication, 2013.","3D face reconstruction; PCA; Tikhonov regularization","","","","","","","","Kemelmacher-Shlizerman I., Basri R., 3D Face Reconstruction from a Single Image Using a Single Reference Face Shape, Pattern Analysis, and Machine Intelligence, 33, pp. 394-405, (2011); Atick J.J., Griffin P.A., Redlich A.N., Statistical approach to shape from shading: Reconstruction of three-dimensional face surfaces from single two-dimensional images, Neural Computation, 8, pp. 1321-1340, (1996); Zhang R., Tsai P.S., Cryer J.E., Shah M., Shape-from-shading: a survey, Pattern Analysis, and Machine Intelligence, 21, pp. 690-706, (1999); Smith W.A., Hancock E.R., Recovering facial shape using a statistical model of surface normal direction, Pattern Analysis, and Machine Intelligence, 28, pp. 1914-1930, (2006); Nandy D., Ben-Arie J., Shape from recognition: a novel approach for 3- D face shape recovery, Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on, 10, pp. 206-217, (2001); Lin C.T., Cheng W.C., Liang S.F., Neural-network-based adaptive hybrid-reflectance model for 3-D surface reconstruction, Neural Networks, 16, pp. 1601-1615, (2005); Nagai T., Naruse T., Ikehara M., Kurematsu A., HMM-based surface reconstruction from single images, in Image Processing. 2002.

This paper describes a novel way to acquire the reasons and contexts behind the prioritization of criteria or alternatives, through a verification mechanism together with a set of logical rules. Essentially, a respondent is expected to visually verify the online responses against the reasons behind the prioritization of each pair of alternatives or criteria. A rule-based approach is then adopted to validate and display the inconsistent responses. Each respondent is expected to correct all detected inconsistency by recording the appropriate reasons and contexts in some concept maps. The resulting verification mechanism could be further enhanced and used as an intelligent organizational knowledge creation and maintenance framework for personalizing a group decision support setting. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Criteria prioritization; Logical inconsistency detection; Verification mechanism","Decision support systems; Concept maps; Group decision supports; Inconsistency detection; Logical rules; Not given; Organizational knowledge; Prioritization; Rule-based approach; Surveys","","","","","","","Siraj S., Preference elicitation from pairwise comparisons in multi-criteria decision making, Thesis Doctor of Philosophy School of Computer Science University of Manchester, (2011); Saaty T., The Analytic Hierarchy Process, (1980); Mateu A.V., A multiple criteria decision making method for heterogeneous data sets, PhD Thesis Department of Computer Science and Mathematics Universitat Politechnica De Catalunya; Lida Y., The number of circular triads in a pairwise comparison matrix and a consistency test in AHP, Journal of the Operations Research Society of Japan, 52, pp. 174-185, (2009); Acovou C.L., Et al., A comparison of pairs, triads and quads in multi-attribute decision making, International Journal of Strategic Decision Sciences (IJSDS), 1, pp. 1-24, (2010); Keri G., On qualitatively consistent, transitive and contradictory judgment matrices emerging from multi attribute decision procedures, Central European Journal of Operations Research, 19, pp. 215-224, (2010); Yadav R., Khoo V.K.T., Lim C.Y., Automatic inconsistency detection for online responses, International Conference On Software and Information Engineering, pp. 657-664, (2011); Nonaka I., Takeuchi H., The Knowledge-Creating Company, (1995); Szczypinska A., Piotrowski E.W., Inconsistency of the judgment matrix in the AHP method and the decision maker's knowledge, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 388, pp. 907-915, (2009); Asahi T., Ikegami T., Fukuzumi S.I., A Usability evaluation method applying AHP and treemap techniques, Human-Computer Interaction New Trends, 5610, pp. 195-203, (2009); Condon E., Golden B., Wasil E., Visualizing group decisions in the analytic hierarchy process, Computers & Operations Research, 30, pp. 1435-1445, (2003); Enez J.M.M.-J., Salvador M., TurOn A., Group preference structures in AHP - group decision making, 2nd Compositional Data Analysis Workshop Girona, (2005); Survey K., 15, (2012); Kandasamy W.B.V., Smarandache F., Fuzzy Cognitive Maps and Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps, (2003); Smarandache F., Neutrosophy, a new branch of philosophy, An International Journal Multiple-Valued Logic, 8, pp. 297-384, (2002); Lim C.Y., Khoo V.K.T., Belaton B., A methodology for deliberating prediction criteria, Applied Mechanics and Materials, 130-134, pp. 1758-1761, (2011)","C.

Firstly, instead of using uniform parameterization in RSC, a modified inverse chord length method is proposed for Bspline parameterisation. It takes the advantage that inverse chord length has much better controllability (i.e. assigning more control points to densely sampled or high variation areas) over other B-spline parameterization methods, and further improves its fitting accuracy by automatically determining the value of the exponential parameter and taking the squareroot of the measurements in the original method. Secondly, to further improve the registration accuracy, a uniform scaling factor is incorporated in RSC for the transformation. An iterative algorithm facilitated with some heuristic initial values and stopping criteria is proposed to recover all the transformations alternatively with a fast convergence rate. Experiments on real skull showed the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2010 IADIS.","B-spline parameterization; Controllability; Modified inverse chord length; Rigid Super-Curves; Scaling factor","Algorithms; Computer vision; Controllability; Convergence of numerical methods; Imaging systems; Parameterization; Three dimensional; Virtual reality; Visualization; B-spline; B-spline parameterization; Chord lengths; Control point; Fast convergence rate; Fitting accuracy; Initial values; Iterative algorithm; Modified inverse chord length; Parameterisation; Parameterization method; Registration accuracy; Rigid registration; Rigid Super-Curves; Scaling factor; Scaling factors; Square-root; Stopping criteria; Splines","","","","","","","Berar M., Desvignes M., Bailly G., Payan Y., 3D Meshes Registration: Application to Statistical Skull Model, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 3212, pp. 100-107, (2004); Besl P.J., McKay N.D., A method for registration of 3D shapes, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 14, 2, pp. 239-256, (1992); Ding C.S., Belaton B., Estimating extremal planes to extract crest lines from volumetric data, Visual Informatics: Bridging Research and Practice, IVIC 2009, pp. 748-758, (2009); Huang Z., Cohen F.S., Affine-invariant B-spline moments for curve matching, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 5, 10, pp. 1473-1480, (1996); Hutton T.J., Et al., Automated registration of 3D faces using dense surfaces models, British Machine Vision Conference, pp. 439-448, (2003); Liao I.Y., Et al., Skull registration using rigid super-curves, Proceedings of the 6th International on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization (CGIV), pp. 475-479, (2009); Lim C.-G., A universal parametrization in B-spline curve and surface interpolation, Computer Aided Geometric Design, 16, 5, pp. 407-422, (1999); Maintz J.B.A., Van den Elsen P.A., Viergever M.A., Registration of SPECT and MR brain images using a fuzzy surface, Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering, 2710, pp. 821-829, (1996); Park H., Lee J.-H., B-spline curve fitting based on adaptive curve refinement using dominant points, CAD Computer Aided Design, 39, 6, pp. 439-451, (2007); Sukmarg O., Rao K.R., B-spline curve representation of segmented object in MPEG compressed domain, WPMC 2000, pp. 1-4, (2000); Suwardhi D., Et al., Coordinate system integration for craniofacial database from multimodal devices, PROC.

These efforts decrease the volume of the security data, marginally reduce the false positive rate, and improve the attack-detection rate. Although the results of these efforts have been encouraging, there are still weaknesses partly due to data quality problems. This paper works on the premise that a quality input data should in theory help in producing good results. Thus, the aim of this paper is to propose an intrusion alert quality framework that addresses alert preparation stage for high-level reasoning by enriching and enhancing the alerts with quality parameters, and then encoding these enriched alerts in the IDMEF format.

Several Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been built and proposed to detect ICMPv6-based DoS and DDoS attacks. However, these IDSs suffer from several drawbacks, such as the inability to detect novel attacks and a low detection accuracy due to their reliance on packet-based traffic representation. Furthermore, the existing IDSs that rely on flow-based traffic representation use simple heuristics features that do not contribute to detecting ICMPv6-based DoS and DDoS attacks. This paper proposes a flow-based IDS by enriching the existing features with a set of new features to improve the detection accuracy. The flow consists of packets with similar attributes (i.e., packets with the same source and destination IP address) and features that can differentiate between normal and malicious traffic behavior, such as the source IP address’s symmetry and the whole flow’s symmetry. The experimental results reveal that the enriched features significantly improved the IDS’s detection accuracy by 16.02% and that the false positive rate decreased by 19.17% compared with state-of-the-art IDSs. © 2022 by the authors.","DDoS; flow-based representation; ICMPv6; intrusion detection; intrusion detection system; IPv6","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (304/PNAV/650958/U154)","This research is funded by Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) via external grant (number 304/PNAV/650958/U154).","Elejla O.E., Belaton B., Anbar M., Smadi I.M., A New Set of Features for Detecting Router Advertisement Flooding Attacks, Proceedings of the 2017 Palestinian International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (PICICT), pp. 1-5; Bahashwan A.A., Anbar M., Hanshi S.M., Overview of IPv6 Based DDoS and DoS Attacks Detection Mechanisms, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1132 CCIS, pp. 153-167, (2020); Conta A., Deering S., Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification.

Many current methods, become extremely slow as the cardinality of the point set increases; making them impractical for large point sets. In this paper, we propose a bi-stage method called bi-GMMTPS, based on Gaussian Mixture Models and Thin-Plate Splines (GMMTPS). The first stage deals with global deformation. The two point sets are grouped into clusters independently using K-means clustering. The cluster centers of the two sets are then registered using a GMM based method. The point sets are subsequently aligned based on the transformation obtained from cluster center registration. At the second stage, the GMM based registration method is again applied, to fine tune the alignment between the two clusters to address local deformation. Experiments were conducted on eight publicly available datasets, including large point clouds. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, is much faster than state-of-the-art methods GMM-TPS and QPCCP (Quadratic Programming based Cluster Correspondence Projection); especially on large non-rigid point sets, such as the swiss roll, bunny and USF face datasets, and challenging datasets with topological ambiguity such as the banana dataset. Although the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) method has comparable computational speed, it is less robust than bi-GMM-TPS. Especially for large point sets, under conditions where the number of clusters is not extreme, a complexity analysis shows that bi-GMM-TPS is more efficient than GMM-TPS. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","Computer vision; Deformation; Quadratic programming; Coherent point drifts; Computational speed; Gaussian Mixture Model; Point-set registrations; Registration methods; Spatial transformation; State-of-the-art methods; Topological ambiguity; Geometry","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, (61473111)","","Bishop C.M., Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, (2006); Bookstein F.L., Principal warps: Thin-plate splines and the decomposition of deformations, IEEE Trans.

In particular, the emphasis is on visualizing the similarities and differences between pairs of trees. The impetus for the work comes from the field of bioinformatics, where biologists construct complex phylogenetic trees to represent the evolution of species or genes. The two main issues that arise when comparing these data is to know how to efficiently and effectively compare phylogenetic trees, and how to visually present the results of the comparison. The primary approach is to present a new framework for tree structure visualization techniques that will display pairs of trees ""face to face"" with leaf nodes aligned. The results show that a combination of automatic and manual rearrangement is often effective in rapidly generating an arrangement that facilitates tree comparison, even for quite large trees. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Bioinformatics; Phylogenetic tree visualization; Visual comparison","Data visualization; Trees (mathematics); Face to face; Phylogenetic trees; Tree comparison; Tree structures; Tree-structured data; Visual comparison; Visualization technique; Bioinformatics","","","","","","","Hall B.G., Phylogenetic Trees Made Easy: A How-To Manual, (2007); Munzner T., Guimbretiere F., Tasiran S., Zhang L., Zhou Y., TreeJuxtaposer: Scalable tree comparison using focus+context with guaranteed visibility, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 22, 3, pp. 453-462, (2003); Shneiderman B., Tree visualization with tree-maps: A 2-D space-filling approach, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 11, 1, pp. 92-99, (1992); Lamping J., Rao R., The hyperbolic browser: A focus + context technique for visualizing large hierarchies, Journal of Visual Languages and Computing, 7, 1, pp. 33-55, (1995); Schulz H.J., Schumann H., Hadlak S., Pointbased tree representation-a new approach for large hierarchies, Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium, pp. 81-88, (2009); Stover B., Muller K., TreeGraph 2: Combining and visualizing evidence from different phylogenetic analyses, BMC Bioinformatics, 11, 7, pp. 7-16, (2010); Wan Z.W.M.N., Talib A.Z., Belaton B., A New Framework for Phylogenetic Tree Visualization, pp. 348-359, (2011)","W.

For a given set of data points, knot vectors are computed using the centripetal approach. Next, number of data points is assimilated around the high curvature areas and the parametrization aspect is computed by the inverse chord length with the new set of data points. Second order derivatives are used to determine the high curvature areas of the curves. The method proposed here enables to construct the curves smoothly around high curvature areas by assigning adequate number of data points for the B-splines. Experimental validations justify the fact that the average curve fitting error yielded by the proposed approach is the lowest when compared to other standard curve models. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Centripetal method; Inverse chord length; Non-uniform cubic B-spline; Second order derivative","Algorithms; Information science; Interpolation; Inverse problems; Ship propellers; Analytical approach; Centripetal method; Chord lengths; Cubic B -spline; Experimental validations; Number of datum; Parametrizations; Second order derivatives; Curve fitting","","","","","RU-PRGS Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/811290, 1001/PKOMP/846051)","This research is supported by the RU-PRGS Universiti Sains Malaysia (1001/PKOMP/846051) grant titled “Skull and Photo Superimposition with Conditional Anthropological Parameters using Computer Sciences.” and RUI grant (1001/PKOMP/811290).

A new protocol named IPv6 was developed in 1998 to overcome the addressing issue and to improve network communications in general. IPv6 is an improved protocol compared to IPv4 in terms of security since it provides built-in security mechanisms, such as IPSec. In addition, it brought new functionalities, such as Neighbour Discovery Protocol (NDP) procedure, which depends on Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) protocol messages. However, IPv6 inherited a number of attacks from IPv4 in addition to new attacks it brought within its new features. One of the most common attacks is the Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to its ease of being launched in different ways. A more serious DoS attack can be launched from many hosts called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). DoS and DDoS attacks are thorny and a grave problem of today's internet, resulting in economic damages for organizations and individuals. Therefore, this paper is created to study the properties of DoS and DDoS attacks against IPv6 networks using ICMPv6 messages. Additionally, it analyzes the various existing detection and prevention approaches that are proposed to tackle ICMPv6-based DoS and DDoS attacks. Moreover, it explains the existing tools that might be used for performing these attacks. © 2017 IETE.","DDoS; DoS; ICMPv6; IPv6 security; NDP","Computer crime; DOS; Internet protocols; Network security; DDoS; Discovery protocol; Distributed denial of service; ICMPv6; Internet control message protocols; IPv6 security; Network communications; Security mechanism; Denial-of-service attack","","","","","","","Tripathi N., DoS and DDoS attacks: Impact, analysis and countermeasures, (2013); Saad R.M., Ramadass S., Manickam S., A study on detecting ICMPv6 flooding attack based on IDs, Australian J.

Our approach uses the number of points between a pair of slices as the basis to retain/reject the slice. We showed with a simple threshold, this approach could exclude slices gradually by increasing the threshold value.

The learning models are trained from a set of examples to reach a state where the model will be able to predict the correct output for other examples. PCA-based statistical modeling is a popular technique for modeling 3D faces, which can be used for 3D face reconstruction. The capability of 3D face leaning models in depicting new 3D faces can be considered as the representational power (RP) of the model. This paper focuses on examining the effect of the sample size (number of training faces) on the accuracy of the 3D face shape reconstruction from a small set of feature points. It also aims to visualize the effect of the training sample size on the RP of PCA-based models. Experiments were designed and carried out on testing and training data of the USF Human ID 3D database. We found that although the representational power increases with a larger training sample size, the accuracy of reconstruction is limited by the number of the feature points used. This means that by reconstructing faces from a limited number of feature points, a definite number of examples are sufficient to build a satisfactory 3D face model. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.","3D face reconstruction; PCA; Regularization; Sample size; Statistical face modeling","Face recognition; Information technology; Sampling; 3D face reconstruction; Face modeling; PCA; Regularization; Sample sizes; Three dimensional","","","","","","","Blanz V., Mehl A., Vetter T., Seidel H.-P., A Statistical Method for Robust 3D Surface Reconstruction from Sparse Data, Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium On 3D Data Processing, Visualization, and Transmission, (2004); Luximon Y., Ball R., Justice L., The 3D Chinese head and face modeling, Computer- Aided Design, 44, pp. 40-47, (2012); Widanagamaachchi W.N., Dharmaratne A.T., 3D Face Reconstruction from 2D Images, Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications, pp. 365-371, (2008); Martin D.L., Yingfeng Y., State-of-the-art of 3D facial reconstruction methods for face recognition based on a single 2D training image per person, Pattern Recogn.

The automatic door gives access to go into or outside a building by sensing the approaching individual using sensors. However, it does not have the intuition to understand when a person is not authorized to go outside based on their age limit, for example, children. To address this problem, researchers have proposed solutions ranging from the use of fuzzy logic to rule-based approaches to make automatic doors better than the previous ones. In this study, an AI-based automatic door system is proposed, which uses a supervised machine learning approach to train classifiers using human body measurement. Our evaluation of different classifiers indicates that SVM is capable of classifying the instances correctly while achieving about 88.9% F-score. Thus, the proposed approach is expected to improve the safety of automatic doors, thereby making them smarter and more intelligent.  © 2020 IEEE.","Automatic door; Body measurement; Machine Learning; Supervised Learning","Fuzzy logic; Supervised learning; Automatic doors; Automatic sliding doors; F-score; Human bodies; Mode of operations; Rule-based approach; Supervised machine learning; Use of fuzzy logic; Learning systems","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research is supported by Universiti Sains Malaysia Postgraduate Conference Fund 2020.","Yang J.-C., Lai C.-L., Sheu H.-T., Chen J.-J., An intelligent automated door control system based on a smart camera, Sensors, 13, 5, pp. 5923-5936, (2013); Lwin H.H., Khaing A.S., Tun H.M., Automatic door access system using face recognition, Int.

With the advent of laser scanners the surface can be captured with high resolution generating a large amount of data. Processing this amount of data for point set registration efficiently, poses the type of challenges being addressed by the big data community. Coherent Point Drift (CPD) is a state-of-the-art point set registration method, that is able to handle large point cloud registration in O(n) time with the incorporation of the Fast Gauss Transform (FGT) and low-rank matrix approximation (LRA). However, its registration accuracy degrades rapidly for large point sets. To overcome this, we present a strategy that divides a large point set into several smaller overlapping subsets. These subsets are then independently registered using CPD that are then merged for final registration. To improve registration accuracy, we also propose a method to tune the width parameter of the Gaussian kernel in CPD. The proposed method has been tested on four large datasets, including the USF 3D face dataset. The results show that the proposed method is able to register large datasets with greater speed and accuracy than the state-of-the-art CPD method. © 2015 IOS Press.","coherent point drift (CPD); division;

The goal of information visualization is unveiling of large amounts of data or abstract data set using visual presentation. With this knowledge the main goal is to develop a 2D presentation of information on movies from the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) as our movie search engine. The aim is to amplify the perception of users over the retrieval environment while preserving the output quality at an acceptable meaningful level. Visualization ideas deal with visualization of information seeking results. These visualization techniques have been collected from the literature on how to map the results of the information retrieval process. We propose a 2D visual interface for mapping collections of movies and exploration of their related information to maximize density of needed information in a single page. For this purpose, we introduce a movie categorization scheme to help users in navigating through the movies information. The traditional style (interface) of clicking a link to view details of documents in most of the search engines like the IMDB (Internet Movie Database) as our movie search engine to find information is very uninteresting and tedious. This is because when clicking a particular link the user's focus is shifted to the new page, and if the information presented is not to their interest, they will need to switch back to the movie's search results. The key contribution is thus a reasonable mapping result of a query on an actor/actress movie database displayed in just one page that can amplify visual perception of retrieved movies. This theory of data graphics interface focuses on maximization of the density of useful pertinent information with respect to users query in a screen page. This method of grouping of information needs some data extraction algorithms by parsing and crawling the IMDB web pages that are useful to retrieve important movies information. Our graphical-based visualization provides a correct understanding of information that users can view information without reading them. A qualitative experimental test comparing the classic (traditional) interface of the IMDB and visual interface was conducted.","2D visual interface; Contribution; Experimental test; Extraction algorithm; IMDB movies' information visualization; Retrieval system (IMDB); Visualization","","","","","","","","Hearst M.A., Karadi C., Cat-a-cone: an interactive interface for specifying searches and viewing retrieval results using a large category, Proceedings of the 20th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval, pp. 246-255, (1997); Shneiderman B., Tree Visualization with tree-maps: A 2D space filling approach, ACM Trans.

Since every company is unique, without the assistance of some methodologies and tools, decision makers encounter great difficulties in conducting predictive analysis, especially in the deliberation and prioritization of new prediction criteria derived from the publicly available unstructured information. This paper proposes a unique methodology which attempts to integrate the personalization and visualization of new prediction criteria. The challenging iterative tasks are achieved through a rule-based inconsistency detection triad-based comparison algorithm, supported by sophisticated visual displays of the relative importance among the prediction criteria. It is hoped that the proposed methodology will intuitively support the decision makers in exploring and deliberating new criteria for making better predictions. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Inconsistency detection; Personalization; Predictive analysis; Unstructured information; Visualization","Decision making; Electronics engineering; Flow visualization; Industry; Visualization; Customer need; Decision makers; Economic downturn; Emerging products; Inconsistency detection; Personalizations; Predictive analysis; Prioritization; Relative importance; Rule based; Technology trends; Unstructured information; Visual display; Forecasting","","","","","","","Shuttleworth M., Prediction in Research: Scientists and Soothsayers, (2009); Davenport T.H., Harris J.G., Competing on analytics: The new science of winning, Boston Massachusetts, (2007); Eckerson W.W., Predictive analytics extending the value of your data warehousing investment, TDWI Best Practices Report First Quarter 2007, (2007); Spangler S.W., Kreulen J.T., Mining the Talk - Unlocking the Business Value in Unstructured Information, (2008); Shmueli G., Koppius O., The challenge of prediction in information systems research, Social Science Research Network Working Paper Series, (2008); Siegel E., Seven Reasons You Need Predictive Analytics Today, (2010); SPSS: 10 Really Good Reasons to Use Predictive Analytics, (2009); SPSS: Increase Customer Value with Predictive Analytics: How Predictive Analytics Benefits Gaming Organizations, (2006); Ramakrishnan R., Madure R., Predictive Analytics: Extending BI Infrastructure, (2008); Liu Y., Agichtein E., You've got answers: Towards personalized models for predicting success in community question answering, Proceedings of the 46th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technologies, (2008); Spohrer J., Service Science An Emerging Multidiscipline to Accelerate the Coevolution of Business-Technology-Work Innovations, (2004); Yadav R., Khoo V.K.T., Lim C.Y., Automatic inconsistency detection for online responses, International Conference on Software and Information Engineering (ICSIE 2011), (2011); Viz.Biz: Introduction to Visualization, (2007); (2007)","C.Y.

The two common factors that are generally concerned with such models are the size of the training dataset and the selection of different examples in the training set. The representational power (RP) of an example-based model is its capability to depict a new 3D face for a given 2D face image. The RP of the model can be increased by correspondingly increasing the number of training samples. In this contribution, a novel approach is proposed to increase the RP of the 3D face reconstruction model by deforming a set of examples in the training dataset. A PCA-based 3D face model is adapted for each new near frontal input face image to reconstruct the 3D face shape. Further an extended Tikhonov regularisation method has been employed to reconstruct 3D face shapes from a set of facial points. The results justify that the proposed adaptive PCA-based model considerably improves the RP of the standard PCA-based model and outperforms it with a 95% confidence level. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.","","3D modeling; Face recognition; Image reconstruction; 3-D face modeling; 3D face reconstruction; Confidence levels; Principle component analysis; Regularisation; Three dimensional (3D) face reconstruction; Training dataset; Training sample; Three dimensional computer graphics","","","","","","","Elyan E., Ugail H., Reconstruction of 3D human facial images using partial differential equations, J.

In real world cases, an increasing number of student enrolments, variety of courses throw in the growing challenge in the research with a wider range of constraints. Many optimization problems are concerned with the best feasible solution with minimum execution time of algorithms. The aim of this paper is to propose rough sets methods to investigate the Carter datasets. Two rough sets (RS) approaches are used for the data analysis. Firstly, the discretization process(DP) returns a partition of the value sets into intervals. Secondly the rough sets Boolean reasoning (RSBR) achieves the best decision table on the large data instances. The rough sets classified datasets are experimented with an examination scheduler. The improvements of the solutions on Car-s-91 and Car-f-91 datasets are reported. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","discretization; Examination Timetabling; Rough sets","Artificial intelligence; Cellular automata; Data reduction; Decision tables; Teaching; Academic institutions; Boolean reasoning; Data sets; Discretization process; Discretizations; Examination timetabling; Execution time; Feasible solution; Large data; Optimization problems; Rough set; Student enrolment; Value sets; Rough set theory","","","","","","","Burke E.K., Elliman D.G., Ford P.H., Weare R.F., Examination timetabling in British Universities - A survey, LNCS, 1153, pp. 76-90, (1996); Burke E.K., Elliman D.G., Weare R.F., A hybrid genetic algorithm for highly constrained timetabling problems, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Genetic Algorithms (ICGA 1995), Pittsburgh, USA, July 15-19, pp. 605-610, (1995); Burke E.K., Bykov Y., Newall J., Petrovic S., A time-predefined local search approach to exam timetabling problems, IIE Transactions on Operations Engineering, pp. 509-528, (2004); Caramia M., Dell'Olmo P., Italiano G.F., New algorithms for examination timetabling, LNCS, 1982, pp. 230-241, (2001); Carter M.W., Laporte G., Lee S.Y., Examination timetabling: Algorithmic strategies and applications, Journal of the Operational Research Society, pp. 373-383, (1996); Joshua J., Et al., The Perception of Interaction on the University Examination Timetabling Problem, Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling; Al-Betar M., Et al., A Combination of Metaheuristic Components based on Harmony Search for the Uncapacitated Examination Timetabling, Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling; Boizumault P., Delon Y., Peridy L., Constraint logic programming for examination timetabling, The Journal of Logic Programming, 26, 2, pp. 217-233, (1996); Brailsford S.C., Potts C.N., Smith B.M., Constraint satisfaction problems: Algorithms and applications, European Journal of Operational Research, 119, pp. 557-581, (1999); Burke E.K., De Werra D., Kingston J., Applications in timetabling, Handbook of Graph Theory, pp. 445-474, (2003); Burke E.K., Newall J.P., Solving examination timetabling problems through adaption of heuristic orderings, Annals of Operations Research, 129, pp. 107-134, (2004); Burke E.K., Petrovic S., Recent research directions in automated timetabling, European Journal of Operational Research, 140, pp. 266-280, (2002); Qu R., Burke E.K., McCollum B., Merlot L.T.G., Lee S.Y., A Survey of Search Methodologies and Automated System Development for Examination Timetabling, Journal of Scheduling, 12, 1, pp. 55-89, (2008); McCollum B., Schaerf A., Paechter B., McMullan P., Lewis R., Parkes A., Di Gaspero L., Qu R., Burke E., Setting the Research Agenda in Automated Timetabling: The Second International Timetabling Competition, INFORMS Journal on Computing, 22, 1, pp. 120-130, (2010); Carter M.W., A survey of practical applications of examination timetabling algorithms, Operation Research, 34, 2, pp. 193-202, (1986); Carter M.W., Laporte G., Lee S.Y., Examination timetabling: Algorithmic strategies and applications, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 47, pp. 373-383, (1996); Pawlak Z., Rough sets, International Journal of Computer and Information Science, 11, pp. 341-356, (1982); Pawlak Z., Rough Sets Theoretical Aspect of Reasoning about Data, (1991); Pawlak Z., Grzymala-Busse J., Slowinski R., Ziarko W., Rough sets, Communications of the ACM, 38, 11, pp. 89-95, (1995); Slezak D., Various approaches to reasoning with frequency-based decision reducts: A survey, Rough Sets in Soft Computing and Knowledge Discovery: New Developments, (2000); Pal S.K., Polkowski L., Skowron A., Rough-Neuro Computing: Techniques for Computing with Words, (2004)","J.

Advances in embedded system architecture and compressed IPv6 have enabled IP stack functionality in resource-constrained heterogeneous smart devices. The IETF Routing Over Low power and Lossy network (ROLL) Working Group (WG) devised IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) to enable the communication between network nodes in IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN). The limited resources and heterogeneity of 6LoWPAN nodes make it challenging to design a security solution for Low Power and Lossy Networks, making them vulnerable to various security threats and attacks. Numerous security mechanisms based on trust, threshold, secure routing, authentication, and encryption have shown promising results in detecting anomalous activities in RPL-based 6LoWPAN. As a result, this study systematically examines and critically analyses the existing research domain on RPL security mechanisms. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of demographic characteristics, existing and new attacks, simulation programmes, network configuration, and evaluation measures in RPL-based 6LoWPAN. In addition, it proposes a thorough discussion of current issues, research challenges, and suggestions for future research avenues. This study reveals that most of the studies are published in IEEE Xplore® database and mainly comprises journal articles. Furthermore, the trust-based mechanism is the most used security mechanism for securing RPL-based 6LoWPAN.

Many of us now use physical and electronic devices in our daily lives to perform and deliver specific services. All physical and electronic devices are linked together in IoT networks. Some of these devices, known as constrained devices, are battery-powered and operate in low-energy mode. Therefore, to allow communication and forward packets between constrained devices. The routing protocol for a low-power and lossy network (RPL) is proposed. RPL, on the other hand, is not an energy-aware protocol, making it vulnerable to a wide range of security threats. Denial of Service (DDoS) flooding attacks were the most significant attacks that targeted RPL. Hence, a reliable method for detecting DDoS flooding-based RPL attacks is required. In this paper, an ensemble Feature Selection (FS) approach for detecting DDoS attacks in RPL networks is presented. The proposed approach employs three bio-inspired algorithms to select the optimal subset of features that contribute to high detection accuracy. Furthermore, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a classification algorithm to evaluate the subset of features produced by bio-inspired algorithms. Finally, the proposed approach is expected to significantly detect and identify DDoS flooding attack patterns in RPL networks. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","6LoWPAN; Hello-flooding attacks; Internet of things security; Intrusion detection; LLN; Machine learning; Routing attacks; RPL","Denial-of-service attack; Feature extraction; Floods; Internet of things; Low power electronics; Network security; Power management (telecommunication); Support vector machines; Thermoelectric equipment; 6LoWPAN; Ensemble feature selections; Flooding attacks; Hello flooding; Hello-flooding attack; Internet of thing security; Intrusion-Detection; LLN; Routing attacks; RPL; Intrusion detection","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","Acknowledgment.

Generating a diffusion tractograph from raw MRI data involves multiple layers of processes. Each set of processes that produces a particular analysis is called a pipeline. An extensive collection of software tools have been developed over the years for each layer of tractograph generation, giving researchers the freedom to choose the tools of their preference for different processes. However, this has resulted in the establishment of various pipelines aimed towards the same task, and depending upon an analysis, one pipeline may be more suitable than the other. This creates a hurdle for the clinical application of the DTI tools, as the clinicians and neuroscience researchers are not usually conversant with the technical aspects of the DTI tools. This study proposes an automated decision model for selection of tractography pipelines that will allow researchers and clinicians to select best of the possible DTI pipelines for a particular Analysis. © 2022 IEEE.","Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI); Fuzzy Logic; Pipeline; Tractography; Workflows","Diffusion; Fuzzy logic; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pipelines; Tensors; Conceptual frameworks; Diffusion tensor imaging; Fuzzy-Logic; Imaging tools; In-vivo; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Multiple layers; Tractography; White matter; Work-flows; Diffusion tensor imaging","","","","","Kementerian Pengajian Tinggi, Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM, (FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/USM/03/1)","This study is sponsored by Kementerian Pengajian Tinggi, Malaysia and Universiti Sains Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), grant# FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/USM/03/1.","Walls H.A., Upthegrove W.R., Theory of liquid diffusion phenomena, Acta Metallurgica, 12, 5, pp. 461-471, (1964); Mukherjee P., Berman J.I., Chung S.W., Hess C.P., Henry R.G., Diffusion Tensor MR Imaging and Fiber Tractography: Theoretic Underpinnings, AJNR, 29, 4, pp. 632-641, (2008); Moseley M.E., Et al., Diffusion-weighted MR imaging of anisotropic water diffusion in cat central nervous system, Radiology, 176, 2, pp. 439-445, (1990); Douek P., Turner R., Pekar J., Patronas N., Bihan D.L., MR Color Mapping of Myelin Fiber Orientation, JCAT, 15, 6, pp. 923-929, (1991); Beaulieu C., The basis of anisotropic water diffusion in the nervous system-A technical review, NMR in Biomed, 15, 78, pp. 435-455, (2002); Pierpaoli C., Jezzard P., Basser P.J., Barnett A., Chiro G.D., Diffusion tensor MR imaging of the human brain, Radiology, 201, 3, pp. 637-648, (1996); Song S.-K., Sun S.-W., Ramsbottom M.J., Chang C., Russell J., Cross A.H., Dysmyelination Revealed through MRI as Increased Radial (but Unchanged Axial) Diffusion of Water, NeuroImage, 17, 3, pp. 1429-1436, (2002); Hagmann P., Jonasson L., Maeder P., Thiran J.-P., Wedeen V.J., Meuli R., Understanding Diffusion MR Imaging Techniques: From Scalar Diffusion-weighted Imaging to Diffusion Tensor Imaging and beyond, RadioGraphics, 26, 1, pp. S205-S223, (2006); Dell'Acqua F., Tournier J., Reconstructing fiber orientations with diffusion MRI, NMR Biomed, (2017); Le Bihan D., Breton E., In vivo diffusion imaging by nuclear magnetic resonance, Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences.

This study surveys isosurface construction methods, particularly in implicit surface polygonization using tracking partition. An investigation is conducted on the implementation of it. With reference of original Jules Bloomenthal's implementation, an extension of the implicit surface polygonization is developed with concern of real volumetric data. Rather than conventional methods, such as Marching Cubes and its variants, the method has advantages on time complexity, flexibility and is easy to implement. A brief comparison has been done among these methods. During the development, some practical issues, such as starting point placement, seed point generation, manifold surface, manifoldwith- boundary, are addressed. Possible solutions of these problems are suggested. Some ideas on enhancement of the method are conveyed at end of this paper for further work. © 2009 IEEE.","Implicit polygonization; Isosurface extraction; Visualization","Computer graphics; Volumetric analysis; Conventional methods; Implicit polygonization; Implicit surface polygonization; Isosurface construction; Isosurface extraction; Marching cube; ON time; Possible solutions; Practical issues; Scientific visualizations; Seed point; Volumetric data; Visualization","","","","","","","Shahidi R., Et al., Surface rendering versus volume rendering in medical imaging: Techniques and applications, IEEE Visualization Proceedings of the 7th conference on Visualization, pp. 439-440, (1996); Lorensen W., Cline H., Marching Cubes: A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm, ACM Computer Graphics, 21, 4, pp. 163-169, (1987); Bloomenthal J., Polygonization of Implicit Surfaces, Computer Aided Geometric Design, 5, pp. 341-355, (1988); Shirley P., A polygonal approximation to direct scalar volume rendering, ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics archive, 24, 5, pp. 63-70, (1990); Nielson G.M., Dual Marching Tetrahedra: Contouring in the Tetrahedronal Environment, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5358, pp. 183-194, (2008); Chernyaev E., Marching Cubes 33: Construction of Topologically Correct Isosurfaces, (1995); Lopes A., Brodlie K., Improving the robustness and accuracy of the marching cubes algorithm for isosurfacing Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions, 9, 1, pp. 16-29, (2003); Samet H., The quadtree and related hierarchical data structures, ACM Computer Survey, 16, 2, pp. 186-260, (1984); Wilhelm J., Gelder A., Octrees for faster isosurface generation, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 11, 3, pp. 201-227, (1992); Kazhdan M., Klein A., Dalal K., Hoppe H., Unconstrained Isosurface Extraction on Arbitrary Octrees, Proceedings of the fifth Eurographics symposium on Geometry processing, pp. 125-133, (2007); Bloomenthal J., Implicit Surfaces, Encyclopedia of computer science and technology, 44, pp. 227-258, (2001); Bloomenthal J., An implicit surface polygonizer, Graphics Gems IV, pp. 324-349, (1994); Jackson S.A., Thomas R.M., Introduction to CT Physics, Crosssectional imaging made easy, pp. 3-16, (2004); Bloomenthal J., Ferguson K., Polygonization of non-manifold implicit surfaces, Proceedings of the 22nd annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques, pp. 309-316, (1995)","P.

A case study on USF Human ID 3D database has been used to study these effect. We found that, if the test face is from the training set, then any set of any number greater than or equal to the number of training faces can reconstruct exact 3D face. If the test face does not belong to the training set, it will hardly reconstruct the exact 3D face using 3D PCA-based models. However, it could reconstruct an approximate face shape depending on the number of feature points and the weighting factor. Furthermore, the accuracy of reconstruction by a large number of feature points (> 150) is relatively the same in all cases even with different locations of points on the face.

Recently, a drastic increase in the number of brain disorders has been noted. This has indirectly led to an increased demand for automated brain segmentation solutions to assist medical experts in early diagnosis and treatment interventions. This paper aims to present a critical review of the recent trend in segmentation and classification methods for brain magnetic resonance images. Various segmentation methods ranging from simple intensity-based to high-level segmentation approaches such as machine learning, metaheuristic, deep learning, and hybridization are included in the present review. Common issues, advantages, and disadvantages of brain image segmentation methods are also discussed to provide a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of existing methods. From this review, it is found that deep learning-based and hybrid-based metaheuristic approaches are more efficient for the reliable segmentation of brain tumors. However, these methods fall behind in terms of computation and memory complexity. © 2021 by the authors.

CS makes use of imaging techniques to identify an unknown skull by matching it with the available face photographs of missing individuals. Life-size enlargement of the face image and orientating the skull to correspond to the posture seen in the face photograph are the two main problems that affect identification accuracy with both the conventional and the computer-aided methods. Unlike the existing techniques, this research proposes a 3D skull–3D face model superimposition (3D–3D) approach to address the above two issues. The proposed method commences by reconstructing the 3D face model from a given 2D face image using the mean simplified generic elastic model, followed by registering the face model to a 3D skull along the jaw line using the analytical curvature B-spline (AC B-spline). The accuracy index of the registration is then evaluated to suggest the degree to which the face image corresponds to a skull. The superimpositions of positive and negative cases were conducted on a set of 3D skulls versus a set of 2D face images. The accuracy indices of the registration results suggest that the AC B-spline is more robust in 3D–3D superimposition compared to the other existing methods. The full experimental results have demonstrated the potential of the proposed method as an assistive tool to the forensic scientists for craniofacial identifications. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","3D face reconstruction; B-spline; Craniofacial superimposition; Curve registration; Generic elastic model","3D modeling; Computer forensics; Interpolation; Photography; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D face reconstruction; B splines; Craniofacial; Curve registration; Generic elastic models; Image reconstruction","","","","","RUT; ScienceFund Malaysia, (01-01-05-SF0045); Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, HUSM, (1001/PKOMP/814109, 1001/PPSG/852004)","Funding text 1:  This research is supported by Department of Radiology Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (RUT Grant, 1001/PPSG/852004). ; Funding text 2: This research is supported by Department of Radiology Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (RUT Grant, 1001/PPSG/852004).; Funding text 3: CT head scans of patients were randomly collected from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) server at the Radiology Department, Hospital USM.

Limited resources of 6LoWPAN nodes make it challenging to secure the environment, leaving it vulnerable to threats and security attacks. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches have shown promise as effective and efficient mechanisms for detecting anomalous behaviors in RPL-based 6LoWPAN. Therefore, this paper systematically reviews and critically analyzes the research landscape on ML, DL, and combined ML-DL approaches applied to detect attacks in RPL networks. In addition, this study examined existing datasets designed explicitly for the RPL network. This work collects relevant studies from five major databases: Google Scholar, Springer Link, Scopus, Science Direct, and IEEE Xplore® digital library. Furthermore, 15,543 studies, retrieved from January 2016 to mid-2021, were refined according to the assigned inclusion criteria and designed research questions resulting in 49 studies. Finally, a conclusive discussion highlights the issues and challenges in the existing studies and proposes several future research directions. © 2022 by the authors.

In this study we proposed a self-contained framework to generate landmarks on surfaces extracted from volumetric data. The framework is designed to be a three-fold pipeline structure. The pipeline comprises three phases which are surface construction, crest line extraction and landmark identification. With input as a volumetric data and output as landmarks, the pipeline takes in 3D raw data and produces a 0D geometry feature. In each phase we investigate existing methods, extend and tailor the methods to fit the pipeline design. The pipeline is designed to be functional as it is modularised to have a dedicated function in each phase. We extended the implicit surface polygonizer for surface construction in first phase, developed an alternative way to compute the gradient of maximal curvature for crest line extraction in second phase and finally we combine curvature information and K-means clustering method to identify the landmarks in the third phase. The implementations are firstly carried on a controlled environment, i.e. synthetic data, for proof of concept. Then the method is tested on a small scale data set and subsequently on huge data set. Issues and justifications are addressed accordingly for each phase. © 2017 Zheng et al.

In this study, we investigate one vital component to extract crest lines, the gradient of the maximal curvature. Most of geometry properties required to calculate crest lines can be obtained from the volume data during the process of the surface construction using implicit surface polygonizer. Nevertheless the gradient of the maximal curvature cannot be obtained due to the nature of the surface construction algorithm. Hence we proposed three weight function based methods in accordance with the knowledge of the surface mesh. We implemented our methods and conducted both qualitative and quantitative analysis on our methods to find the most appropriate method. We also put forward a simple filtering mechanism as a post-processing procedure to enhance the accuracy of the crest lines, which is addressed at the end of this study. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Crest lines; Feature Lines; Gradient; Maximal Curvature; Visual Informatics; Weight Function","Artificial intelligence; Crest lines; Feature lines; Gradient; Maximal Curvature; Visual informatics; Weight functions; Information science","","","","","","","Thiron J.P., Gourdon A., The 3D Marching Lines Algorithm and Its Application to Crest Lines Extraction, (1992); Monga O., Benayoun S., Using Partial Derivatives of 3D Images to Extract Typical Surface Features, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 61, 2, pp. 171-189, (1995); Stylianou G., Farin G., Crest Lines Extraction from 3D Triangulated Meshes, Hierarchical and Geometrical Methods in Scientific Visualization, pp. 269-281, (2003); Hildebrandt K., Polthier K., Wardetzky M., Smooth Feature Lines on Surface Meshes, Third Eurographics Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP 2005), pp. 85-90, (2005); Yoshizawa S., Belyaev A., Seidel H.-P., Fast and Robust Detection of Crest Lines on Meshes, ACM Symposium on Solid and Physical Modelling (SPM 2005), pp. 227-232, (2005); Yoshizawa S., Belyaev A., Seidel H.-P., Fast, Robust and Faithful Method for Detecting Crest Lines on Meshes, Computer Aided Geometric Design, 25, pp. 545-560, (2008); Bloomenthal J., Polygonization of Implicit Surfaces, Computer Aided Geometric Design, 5, pp. 341-355, (1988); Burns M., Klawe J., Rusinkiewicz S., Et al., Line Drawings from Volume Data, ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proc.

Our goal is to propose an enhancement to extremal planes estimation technique for crest lines extraction and to test the method for medical purpose. Differential geometry approach is applied to the 3D surfaces based on 3rd order derivatives computation of principal curvatures and principal directions to estimate extremal planes for crest lines extraction.

If not timely and properly diagnosed, the probability of it becoming malignant is high. Therefore, accurate segmentation of brain tumors at an initial stage is essential for quantifying the brain tumor structures. Many automatic and semi-automatic approaches such as machine learning and deep learning have been explored for brain structure segmentation. However, these approaches suffer mainly from high dependency on the large training datasets and computation burden. To resolve these issues, we proposed an unsupervised brain tumor sub-regions segmentation approach, termed Dominant Grey Level based PSO Clustering. This segmentation approach utilizes dominant grey levels to provide automatic centroids initialization to the Particle Swarm optimization method to perform the segmentation of brain tumor sub-regions. The sensitivity to unwanted artifacts and random cluster initialization is greatly reduced for the proposed approach. Furthermore, using a dominant grey level to enhance the quality of initial candidate solutions of the PSO population improves the convergence speed of particles toward an optimal solution and prevents traping into local optima. The whole approach is evaluated on 30 volumes of MRI images acquired from the BRATS 2019 dataset and attained a Dice score of 0.865, 0.822, and 0.803 for the whole, core, and enhancing tumor regions respectively. The quantitative results are also compared with the standard K-Means and conventional PSO methods and some other recently published studies which report a promising segmentation efficiency in term of Dice score and Jaccard index. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Brain tumor; Clustering; Magnetic resonance imaging; Particle swarm optimization; Segmentation","Brain; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; K-means clustering; Large dataset; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Tumors; Automatic approaches; Brain tumors; Causes of death; Clusterings; Gray-level; Human being; Multi-modal; Segmentation; Semi-automatics; Sub-regions; Magnetic resonance imaging","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/USM/03/1)","Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme with Project Code: FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/USM/03/1.","Wadhwa A., Bhardwaj A., Verma V.S., A review on brain tumor segmentation of MRI images, Magn Reson Imaging, 61, pp. 247-259, (2019); Saman S., Jamjala S., Survey on brain tumor segmentation and feature extraction of MR images, Int J Multimed Inf Retr, (2018); Bakas S., Et al., Advancing the cancer genome atlas glioma MRI collections with expert segmentation labels and radiomic features, Sci Data, 4, pp. 1-13, (2017); Dubey Y.K., Mushrif M.M., FCM clustering algorithms for segmentation of brain MR images, Adv Fuzzy Syst, (2016); Valverde S., Et al., Automated tissue segmentation of MR brain images in the presence of white matter lesions, Med Image Anal, 35, pp. 446-457, (2017); Zhan T., Et al., A glioma segmentation method using cotraining and superpixel-based spatial and clinical constraints, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 57113-57122, (2018); Sun J., Peng Y., Guo Y., Li D., Segmentation of the multimodal brain tumor image used the multi-pathway architecture method based on 3D FCN, Neurocomputing, 423, (2020); Zhang J., Jiang Z., Dong J., Hou Y., Liu B., Attention gate ResU-Net for automatic MRI brain tumor segmentation, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 58533-58545, (2020); Zhou Z., He Z., Shi M., Du J., Chen D., 3D dense connectivity network with atrous convolutional feature pyramid for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging of human heads, Comput Biol Med, 121, (2020); Silva C.A., Pinto A., Pereira S., Lopes A., Multi-Stage Deep Layer Aggregation for Brain Tumor Segmentation.

Fingerprinting process is performed as step before the attack stage on the remote host. There are two types of fingerprinting; active and passive fingerprinting. However, each type encountered limitation when implemented separately in networks, and their inability to provide accurate information about the host services/applications. The main objective of this paper is to propose possibility of enhancing the detection process of the host profiling, applications/ services fingerprinting and the methods of host identification. Herein, we perform network host profiling by identifying different services/ applications that were running on the host. More so, we exploit sophisticated process of application layer protocol payloads by active and passive fingerprinting tools. Besides, we attempt to add a layer of correctness into these tool results, by building a new database of signatures which is derived from these results. The new signature database can be tested either exactly or through approximate fuzzy matching.

By using Maximum Posterior Probability estimation, prior information modeled by PCA is connected to Tikhonov regularization method in order to solve the ill-posed problem of 3D face reconstruction. The prior information is learned from 3D faces of a standard 3D database. However, the optimal value of the regularization parameter λ is usually not available in advance. To overcome this problem, we restrict the distance between the reconstructed 3D face and the average 3D face close to the average of the distances between sample 3D faces and the average 3D face. This is due to the fact that the sample data are mostly located at the boundary of the data space for high dimensional and low sample size problems, which is the case for 3D faces. The optimal regularization parameter is then obtained to reconstruct the 3D face shape of a given 2D near frontal image using limited number of feature. The solution is plausible while not over-smoothing. By warping the 2D texture to the reconstructed face shape, 3D face reconstruction is achieved. Our experimental results justify the robustness of the proposed approach with respect to the reconstruction of realistic 3D face shapes from a small set of 2D facial coordinates. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","3D face reconstruction; High dimension low sample size; PCA; Tikhonov regularization","Information science; Parameterization; Problem solving; 3D face reconstruction; Maximum posterior probability; Optimal regularization; PCA; Regularization parameters; Sample sizes; Tikhonov regularization; Tikhonov regularization method; Face recognition","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","This research is supported by the RUI grant: RUI# 1001/PKOMP/811290 awarded by Universiti Sains Malaysia.","Zhenqiu Z., Yuxiao H., Tianli Y., Huang T., Minimum variance estimation of 3D face shape from multi-view, 7Th International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, FGR 2006, pp. 547-552, (2006); Widanagamaachchi W.N., Dharmaratne A.T., 3D face reconstruction from 2D images, Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications, DICTA 2008, pp. 365-371, (2008); Martin D.L., Yingfeng Y., State-of-the-art of 3D facial reconstruction methods for face recognition based on a single 2D training image per person, Pattern Recogn.

The method that restitutes the rigid transformation between two sets of fully matched curves is propounded. RSC exploits the non-ambiguity of B-Spline representation of supercurves whilst overcoming the inability of super-curves to restore rigid transformations. A further contribution of this study is a two-stage algorithm based on RSC which registers two sets of partially matched curves under a rigid transformation. The algorithm improves the robustness over feature based methods by considering the structure rather than individual points of the curve. Experimental results on CT scanned skull data show that proposed algorithm is more robust and accurate at restoring the rigid transformation between two sets of crest line data compared with Iterated Closest Point and Super Curves methods. © 2009 IEEE.","Crest lines; Curve matching; Iterated-closestpoint; Medical image registration; Rigid transformation; Super-curves","Algorithms; Computer graphics; Image registration; Splines; Visualization; B-spline representation; Crest lines; Curve matching; Feature-based method; Medical image registration; Rigid transformations; Two-stage algorithm; Graph theory","","","","","","","Gueziec A., Ayache N., New developments on geometric hashing for curve matching, IEEE Conf. on CVPR, pp. 703-704, (1993); Thirion J.P., Gourdon A., The 3D Marching Lines Algorithm and Its Application to Crest Lines Extraction, 1672, (1992); Pajdla T., Van Gool L., Matching of 3-D Curves using Semidifferential Invariants, Fifth.

As an initial step to understand IPv6 networks and their vulnerabilities it is of critical importance to identify the characteristics of the connected devices. Detecting the OS fingerprints of these devices is one of these characteristics that are essential to identifying the vulnerabilities of each of them. Currently, few OS detection methods have supported IPv6 protocol, as it did not fully replace IPv4 yet. This paper attempts to describe the existing methods of OS fingerprinting with IPv6, as well as their challenges and limitations. Moreover, this paper studies the available datasets that might be used for IPv6 OS fingerprinting. By understanding the existing methods and datasets, the reader can figure out the current needs for proposing new OS fingerprinting methods for IPv6 protocol. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","IPv6 protocol; Network security; OS fingerprinting","Network protocols; Network security; Detection methods; Fingerprinting methods; IPv6 networks; IPv6 protocol; Security issues; Internet protocols","","","","","","","(2014); Elejla O.E., Anbar M., Belaton B., ICMPv6-based DoS and DDoS attacks and defense mechanisms, IETE Tech.

Unfortunately, these logs and alerts are not only huge in number but also poor in data quality i.e. containing false logs/alerts. This in turn poses two main challenges to higher-level operations; first computationally efficient algorithms are needed to process and sift through large unverified logs and alerts. Second is the need to develop algorithms that avoid making wrong conclusions due to poor quality logs and alerts. In this paper, we implement intrusion alert quality framework to reduce false positive alerts in IDS. Using this framework, we enrich each alert with quality parameters such as correctness, accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity. To compliment this effort, we normalize the enriched alerts in the IDMEF format. In this form (enriched and normalized), higher level operations are given the option to utilize the quality parameters values tagged in the alerts in their core operations in order to produce good conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in reducing false positive alerts using DARPA 2000 network traffic. © 2005 IEEE.","Alert correlation; Data quality; Intrusion detection; Security","Algorithms; Computational methods; Computer system firewalls; Reliability; Routers; Alert correlation; Data quality; Intrusion detection; Security of data","","","","","","","(2005); Feinstein B., Matthews G., White J., The Intrusion Detection Exchange Protocol (IDXP), IETF IDWG, (2005); Kruegel C., Robertson W., Alert Verification - Determining the Success of Intrusion Attempts, Proc.

In real world cases, an increasing number of student enrolments, variety of courses throw in the growing challenge in the research with a wider range of constraints. Many optimization problems are concerned with the best feasible solution with minimum execution time of algorithms. The aim of this paper is to propose rough sets methods to investigate the Carter datasets. Two rough sets (RS) approaches are used for the data analysis.

In particular, the emphasis is on visualising the similarities and differences between pairs of trees. There are many research areas (such as biology, linguistics, chemistry and computer science) that use the tree as a basic data structure. The impetus for the work comes from the field of bioinformatics, where biologists construct complex phylogenetic trees to represent the evolution of species or genes. When dealing with these sorts of data, biologists often have to deal with multiple trees generated from the same set of data. The biologists have to compare these trees in order to get a better understanding of these data. This paper aims to explore techniques to visualise the differences between two phylogenetic trees. Specifically, an application has been developed, named VCPT (Visual Comparison of Phylogenetic Trees) that implements for a new algorithm and display-based approaches that will help in visualising the similarity and differences between the phylogenetic trees. © 2010 University Sains Malaysia.","Bioinformatics Visualisation; Phylogenetic Trees; Tree Structured Data","Bioinformatics; Biology; Data structures; Genes; Plant extracts; Visualization; Multiple trees; Phylogenetic trees; Research areas; Tree-structured data; Visual comparison; Trees (mathematics)","","","","","","","Munzner T., Guimbretiere F., Tasiran S., Zhang L., Zhou Y., TreeJuxtaposer: Scalable tree comparison using focus+context with guaranteed visibility, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 22, 3, pp. 453-462, (2003); Irwin R., Biology Lectures: Introduction to Systematics, (2003); The willi henning society, About Willi Henning; Wan Zainon W.N., Calder P., Visualising phylogenetic trees, Proc. 7th Australasian User Interface Conference, pp. 145-152, (2006); Maddison D.R., The Tree of Life: Web Project; Lipscomb D., Basics of Cladistic Analysis, (1998); Carrizo S.F., Phylogenetic trees: An information visualisation perpective, Proc. 2nd Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Conference, pp. 315-320, (2004); Thollesson M., Phylogenetic Inference of Evolutionary Relationships, (2001); Roderic D.M., Component 2.0-User Guide, (1993); Mesquite Manual; Makarenkov V., T-REX: Reconstructing and visualizing phylogenetic trees and reticulation networks, Bioinformatics, 17, 7, pp. 664-668, (2001); Bryant D., Building Trees, Hunting for Trees and Comparing Trees, (1997); Lozano A., Pinter R.Y., Rokhlenko O., Valiente G., Ziv-Ukelson M., Seeded tree alignment, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB), 5, 4, pp. 503-513, (2008); Amenta N., Klinger J., Case study: Visualizing sets of evolutionary trees, Proc.

The segmentation takes place by initially performing K-means clustering and then recombination. K-means algorithm uses RGB color values, diagonal busyness factor (sum of color differences among central and diagonal pixels) and epsilon spatiality factor (sum of Euclidian distances of pixels belonging to a particular cluster from their cluster center) as its clustering parameters in order to produce optionally compact or loose clusters representative of inherent color and texture. In addition, three different distribution methods are introduced to initialize central points and therefore improve the clustering accuracy. The methods are evenly spaced values, random values and evenly spaced samples respectively. In evenly spaced values, clusters (central points) are evenly distributed along the range of RGB colors available with in the image so that each cluster may partially represent a sub range of the total range of colors available with in the image. In random values, the distribution of clusters (central points) is not even. To define a central point an RGB color is randomly selected from the range of RGB colors available with in the image. In evenly spaced samples the distribution of clusters (central points) is based on X and Y (width and height) coordinates rather than color. To obtain an even distribution, total number of image pixels are calculated and then divided by the number of clusters (central points). Recombination is performed by scanning the neighborhood of each pixel in eight connected directions and determining the class (cluster) to which majority of neighbors belong. The class of central pixel (the pixel whose neighborhood is scanned) is then changed to the class (cluster) that majority of neighbors belong. © 2009 IEEE.","Color; Image segmentation; K-means; Spatiality; Texture","Color; Computer graphics; Digital image storage; Image segmentation; Textures; Visualization; Central point; Cluster centers; Clustering accuracy; Color difference; Color image segmentation; Color values; Different distributions; Distribution of cluster; Euclidian distance; General purpose; Image pixels; K-means; k-Means algorithm; K-means clustering; Number of clusters; Object extraction; Random values; RGB images; Segmentation system; Pixels","","","","","","","Luo M., Ma Y.F., Zhang H.J., A spatial constrained K-means approach to image segmentation, Proceedings of 4 Pacific Rim Conference on Multimedia, pp. 738-742, (2003); Shapiro L.G., Stockman G.C., Computer Vision, pp. 279-325, (2001); A Tutorial on Clustering Algorithms; MacQueen J.B., Some methods for classification and analysis of multivariate observations,  Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, pp. 281-297, (1967); Fahim, Salem, Torkey, Ramadan, An efficient enhanced K-means clustering algorithm, Journal of Zhejiang University, pp. 1626-1633, (2006); Avula S.R., Tang J., Acton S.T., An object based image retrieval system for digital libraries, Journal of Multimedia Systems, pp. 260-270, (2006); Chau A., Walters J., Perceptual Color Image Segmentation, (2003); Petrou M., Mirmehdi M., Coors M., Perceptual smoothing and segmentation of color textures,  European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 623-639, (1998); Belongie S., Carson C., Greenspan H., Malik J., Color and texture based segmentation using em and its application to content based image retrieval,  International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 675-682, (1998); Komatsiaris I., Triantafillou E., Strintzis M.G., Region based color image indexing and retrieval,  International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing, pp. 392-395, (2001)","A.

One of these attacks is Router Advertisement (RA) flooding attack by sending a huge traffic toward a victim to consume its resources and stop its services. To detect these attacks, classification processes are applied based on a set of features used to represent the network traffic. This paper proposes a set of representative features depends on a suitable formation of data using a flow representation of the traffic. The proposed features and representation have achieved an acceptable detection ability of the RA flooding attacks using several classification techniques. Moreover, the achieved detection ability might be further improved by extracting more representative features or selecting a subset of them to represent the traffic. © 2017 IEEE.","Attack detection; Features; Flow; ICMPv6; RA flooding","Floods; Routers; Attack detection; Classification process; Classification technique; Detection ability; Features; Flow; ICMPv6; Router Advertisements; Feature extraction","","","","","","","Durda E., Buldu A., IPV4/IPV6 security and threat comparisons, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2, pp. 5285-5291, (2010); Elejla O.E., Belaton B., Anbar M., Alnajjar A., Intrusion detection systems of icmpv6-based DDoS attacks, Neural Computing and Applications, pp. 1-12, (2016); Elejla O.E., Anbar M., Belaton B., ICMPv6-Based dos and ddos attacks and defense mechanisms: Review, IETE Technical Review, pp. 1-18, (2016); Conta A., Gupta M., Internet Control Message Protocol (icmpv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (ipv6) Specification, (2006); Liu W., Ren P., Sun D., Zhao Y., Liu K., Study on attacking and defending techniques in IPv6 networks, 2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP), pp. 48-53, (2015); Beck F., Cholez T., Festor O., Chrisment I., Monitoring the neighbor discovery protocol, Second International Workshop on IPv6 Today-Technology and Deployment-IPv6TD 2007, (2007); Herrera A., How secure is the next-generation internet?

In this paper, we look into the knowledge abstractions techniques to reduce the complexity of problem solving for university examination timetabling problem. The methods consists of recapitulate, visual analysis heuristic (VAH), and specification. The recapitulation groups the successive components, thus reducing the size of the problem. The clustering heuristics, partitioning the problem into easy and difficult components interacting through abstracted pools. The hierarchy of pools allows the user to intervene in conflict resolution at the most appropriate level of abstraction. The specification simplify the decouple components to aid the user in assessing the stiffness of the problem. We propose an algorithm that interleaves these processes. The combinations of these three techniques are evaluated with the real-world examination timetabling room allocation problem scenario. The merits of our approach are minimizing the need for backtracking, provides interactive visual models framework to understand the conflict resolution and offering a comprehensive direction to feasible solution.","Conflict resolution;

By incorporating prior knowledge about the organelle's morphology and image features, the required number of parameter tweaking can be reduced substantially. In practical applications, however, the general organelles' features are often known in advance, yet the actual organelles' morphology is not elaborated. Two primary contributions of this paper are firstly the classification of insulin granules based on its image features and morphology for accurate segmentation - mainly focused at pre-processing image segmentation and secondly the new hybrid meshing quantification is presented. The method proposed in this study is validated on a set of manually defined ground truths. The study of insulin granules in particular; the location, and its image features has also opened up other options for future studies.","","","","","","","","","Olofsson C.S., Salehi A., Holm C., Rorsman P., Palmitate increases l- Type ca2+ currents and the size of the readily releasable granule pool in mouse pancreatic beta- cells, Journal of Physiology, 557, pp. 935-948, (2004); Hutton J.C., The insulin secretory granule, Diabetologia, 32, pp. 271-281, (1989); Howell S.L., The molecular organization of the beta granule of the islets of langerhans, Advances in Cytopharmacology, 2, pp. 319-327, (1974); Ladinsky M.S., Wu C.C., Mcintosh S., Mcintosh J.R., Howell K.E., Structure of the golgi and distribution of reporter molecules at 20 degrees c reveals the complexity of the exit compartments, Molecular Biology of the Cell, 13, pp. 2810-2825, (2002); Marsh B.J., Lessons from tomographic studies of the mammalian golgi, Biochemical and Biophysics Acta, 1744, pp. 273-292, (2005); Russ J.C., Dehoff R.T., Practical Stereology, (2000); Derganc J., Mironov A.A., Svetina S., Physical factors that affect the number and size of golgi cisternae, Traffic, 7, pp. 85-96, (2006); Griffiths G., Fuller S.D., Back R., Hollinshead M., Pfeiffer S., Simons K., The dynamic nature of the golgi complex, Journal of Cell Biology, 108, pp. 277-297, (1989); Marsh B.J., Mastronarde D.N., Buttle K.F., Howell K.E., Mcintosh J.R., Organellar relationships in the golgi region of the pancreatic beta cell line, hit t15, visualized by high resolution electron tomography, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science U S a, 98, pp. 2399-2406, (2001); Ladinsky M.S., Mastronarde D.N., Mcintosh J.R., Howell K.E., Staehelin L.A., Golgi, structure in three dimensions: Functional insights from the normal rat kidney cell, Journal of Cell Biology, 144, pp. 1135-1149, (1999); Nurntan Raihana R., Multiple, Object-oriented Segmentation Methods of Mammalian Cell Tomograms, (2014); Rorsman P., Renstrom E., Insulin granule dynamics in pancreatic beta cells, Diabetologia, 46, pp. 1029-1045, (2003); Noske A.B., Costin A.J., Morgan G.P., Marsh B.J., Expedited approaches to whole cell electron tomography and organelle mark-up in situ in high-pressure frozen pancreatic islets, Journal of Structural, Biology, 161, pp. 298-313, (2008); Kremer J.R., Mastronarde D.N., Mcintosh J.R., Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using imod, Journal of Structural Biology, 116, pp. 71-76, (1996); Nurntan Raihana R., Semi- Automated cellular tomogram segmentation workflow (ctsw): Towards an automaic target scoring system, The International Conference on Computer Graphics, Multimedia and Image Processing, (2014)","","","Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka","","","","","","21801843","","","","English","J.

However, ICMPv6 protocol is vulnerable to different types of attacks such as Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks that are based on ICMPv6 messages. ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks are the most performed attacks against IPv6 networks and considered a grave problem of today Internet. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) under different categories have been proposed to detect ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks. However, these IDSs are inefficient in detecting the attacks due to their limitations. The main limitation of the existing IDSs is the dependency on packet-based representation and features which are unsuitable for detecting DDoS attacks as experimentally proven. Therefore, this research proposes a new IDS, based on a flow-based representation of traffic, and a set of novel features for detecting the attacks. This is the first time a flow-based representation and features are proposed to detect ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks. Cross-validation and supplied set testing approaches have been applied to evaluate the proposed IDS using seven classifiers. The evaluation experiments were conducted based on real datasets and showed that the proposed flow-based IDS with the proposed novel features is efficient and reliable in detecting ICMPv6-based DDoS attacks with acceptable detection accuracies and false positive rates. © 2018, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.","Data mining-based IDS; DDoS; DoS; Flow-based anomaly detection; ICMPv6; IPv6 networks; Network flow","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (304/PNAV/ 6313272)","Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Short Term Research Grant, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) No: 304/PNAV/ 6313272.","Conta A., Deering S., Gupta M., Internet control message protocol (Icmpv6) for the internet protocol version 6 (ipv6) specification, Internet Requests for Comments, RFC, (2006); Postel J., Internet control message protocol.
