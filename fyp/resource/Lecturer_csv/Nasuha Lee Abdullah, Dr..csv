However, the success rate of IVF is still relatively low (38%). A critical factor that influences the success of IVF is the quality of the embryo. The most viable embryo would be chosen to be transferred based on the morphology or appearance of the embryo. Embryologist would have to observe the morphology of embryo before selecting the most viable embryo to be transferred into woman uterus. There are two types of embryo assessment based on morphology, traditional morphology assessment and time-lapse imaging. In traditional morphology assessment, embryologists observe and evaluate the embryo based on grading system available. Meanwhile, in time-lapse imaging, embryo assessment could be done without disturbing embryo culture. Evaluation of the embryos using traditional morphological evaluation and time-lapse were still subjective. Researchers are trying to integrate machine learning into the IVF procedure to increase its success rate. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize the available literature regarding the use of morphology for the selection of viable embryo in IVF using machine learning. © Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan (ZUJ).","Embryo selection; IVF; Machine learning; Morphology; Time-lapse monitoring","","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia","The authors wish to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for the support it has extended in the completion of the present research.","Zegers-Hochschild F., Adamson G., de Mouzon J., Ishihara O., Mansour R., Nygren K., Sullivan E., van derPoel S., The International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technology (ICMART) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Revised Glossary on ART Terminology, 2009, Human Reproduction, 24, 11, pp. 2683-2687, (2009); Sengul Y., Bener A., Uyar A., Emerging technologies for improving embryo selection: a systematic review, Advanced Health Care Technologies, 1, pp. 55-64, (2015); Cutting R., Single embryo transfer for all, Best Practice & Research Clinical Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 53, pp. 30-37, (2018); Pandian Z., Templeton A., Serour G., Bhattacharya S., Number of embryos for transfer after IVF and ICSI: a Cochrane review, Human Reproduction, 20, pp. 2681-2687, (2005); Pribenszky C., Nilselid A.

One of the widely used assistive technologies is the tactile map that consists of Braille labeling and features annotation. The tactile map enables the visually impaired to understand the geographical information of a particular place. However, despite its wide usage, tactile map still lacks in its usability and availability especially in Malaysia. This paper aims to investigate the usability issues of tactile map, identify the requirements and proposed a conceptual prototype named TacTalk to overcome the usability issues of the existing tactile map. Interviews were conducted with the visually impaired at Saint Nicholas' Home for the Blind in Penang. The results shows lack of information, misinterpretation, complexity, and hard to remember the map as the four main usability issues. Hence the proposed solution is named TacTalk, a 'talking tactile map' which consist of a tactile map with embedded buttons that will connect to TacTalk mobile application via Bluetooth to play the audio files once the button is pressed by the user. © 2017 IEEE.","assistive technology; navigation; Tactile map; visually impaired","Navigation; Usability engineering; Vision aids; Assistive technology; Audio files; Geographical information; Malaysia; Mobile applications; Tactile maps; Visually impaired; Maps","","","","","Saint Nicholas' Home for the Blind; University of Southern Maine, USM, (304/PKOMP/6313219); Universiti Sains Malaysia, USM","The authors would like to acknowledge the support from Saint Nicholas' Home for the Blind.

Lack of visibility on accounts receivable management limits efficiency in collection management leading to long aging debtors. Aging payments eventually turns into bad debts leaving a negative impact on the cash flow. The case study company, PangCo Jaya is a wholesale consumer goods distributer located in Malaysia. The objective of this study is to predict payment timing of PangCo Jaya's customers. The outcome of this case study enables collection team to plan for proactive debt collection. This study applies Machine Learning techniques to address accounts receivable challenges faced by PangCo Jaya. The tools used in this study is Python in Jupyter Notebook. A supervised Machine Learning classification model for predicting invoice payment prediction has been developed. This solution enables proficient payment collection by reaching out to targeted customer with potential payment delay prediction. In future, these trends can be applied to evaluate if there is a necessity in revising customers' credit policies and estimate potential receivables that are under risk of turning into bad debts. © 2021 IEEE.","accounts receivable; and predictive modelling; Machine Learning","Forecasting; Risk perception; Sales; Supervised learning; Accounts receivables; Collection management; Consumer Goods; Conversion cycles; Debt collection; Machine learning techniques; Payment collection; Supervised machine learning; Learning systems","","","","","","","Saunders M., Research Method for Business Students, (2009); Impact of accounts receivable management on the ""systemic economic crisis : Current issues and perspectives, 9th International Asecu Conference in University of Nis, (2013); Hayes A., Accounts Receivable (AR), (2021); Michelle W., Cheong L.F., Customer level predictive modelling for accounts receivable modelling to reduce intevention actions, Research Collection School of Information System, (2019); Proactive collection management using artificial intelligence to predict invoice payment dates, Credit Research Foundation 2018 Credit & Financial Management Review, (2018); Sai Zeng P., Using predictive analysis to improve invoice to cash collection, International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), (2008); Customer payment prediction in accounts receivable, International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), (2016); Machine learning the new big thing for competitive advantage, International Journal of Knowledge Engineering and Data Mining, (2018); Types of machine learning algorithms, Towards Data Science, (2017); Comparison of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms for pattern classification, International Journal of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence, (2013); Confusion matrix based feature selection, Proceedings of 22nd Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science, (2011); Appel A.P., Predicting Accounts Receivable with Machine Learning, (2020); A survey on data mining approaches, International Journal of Bio-Science and Bio-Technology, (2013); Data science : Advantages and disadvantages of each regression model, Medium, (2017); Caballe N.C., Machine learning applied to diagnosis of human diseases, MPPDI-Applied Sciences, (2020); Dmde data mining technology for engineering application, 12th Cirp Conference on Intelligent Computation in Manufacturing Engineering, (2019); Assesment of machine learning model performance for predicting alluvial deposits distribution, Procedia Computer Science, Science Direct, (2014); Bhaya S.S., Review of data pre-processing techniques in data mining, Journal of Engineering and Aoolied Science, (2017); The impact of imbalanced training data on machine learning for author name disambiguation, Scientometrics, (2018); Britannica, (2020); Sanz S., Feature selection in machine learning prediction, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, (2018); A comparative performance evaluation of supervised feature, 7th International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications, (2016); Three ways to improve machine learning results without more data, Towards Data Science, (2018); The impact of credit management strategies on liqiudity and profitability, Journal of Behavioural Studies, (2019); How to tune a decision tree, Towards Data Science, (2019)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Umniah and UWallet","2021 International Conference on Information Technology, ICIT 2021","14 July 2021 through 15 July 2021","Amman","170653","","978-166542870-5","","","English","Int.

Thus, it poses to the increasing number of attacks as a result of using various application and tools. Security warning conveys an alert on the potential harm users might expose such as malware and any kind of attacks on their computer. In practice, most of the end users tend to ignore the security warning as it shows the messages repeatedly, although they have been exposed to many risks. A security warning dialogue is supposed to catch the user’s attention and comprehension however, because of users’ past experiences such habituation makes them became less focus. One-to-one interview session with 60 participants was conducted in order to gain further comprehension among the end users experiencing security warning and to investigate the usability issues of current security warning implementation. It is deemed of necessity to discover these usability issues in the current context of security warning presentations. The result revealed that the problems and challenges continue to persist such as difficulties to make a decision, difficulties to comprehend technical jargons, lack of attractiveness of current security warning and issues of habituation or repeated exposures of warnings. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Human-computer interaction; Security; Security warning; Usability; Usable security","Human computer interaction; Malware; Usability engineering; Empirical investigation; Potential harm; Problems and challenges; Security; Security warning; Technical jargon; Usability; Usable security; User experience","","","","","","","Mahajan A., 3.6 Billion Active Internet Users Worldwide by 2018 with Nearly 50% Penetration; Passeri P., Cyber Attacks Statistics; Amran A., Zaaba Z., Mahinderjit Singh M., Usable security: Revealing end-users comprehensions on security warnings, 4Th Information Systems International Conference, ISICO 2017, pp. 635-631, (2017); Wogalter M., Purposes and scope of warnings, Hum.

The function of SCM in an ERP is to maintain manufacturing supply chain, which starts from input of data such as bill of material (BOM), planning, and procurement, right up to manufacturing management. BOM is an important input for supply chain management including Material Requirement Planning (MRP), which is one of ERP modules. This study is done at a multi-national company that has implemented ERP but having problems in inventory management on thousands of raw material and parts in production shop floor. Poor inventory management in production floor will cause excess or shortages of raw material which indirectly impact business performance of the company. Thus an additional module similar to MRP module is proposed to be implemented in the ERP to assist manufacturing department in inventory management to eliminate manual inventory management. This extended module is expected to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of manufacturing productions in managing inventory. © 2017 IEEE.","Bill of Material (BOM); Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Inventory management; Material Requirement Planning (MRP); Production shop floor","Enterprise resource management; Floors; Information systems; Inventory control; Management information systems; Manufacture; Metadata; Resource allocation; Supply chain management; Bill of materials; Enterprise resource planning (ERP); Inventory management; Material requirement planning; Production shops; Enterprise resource planning","","","","","Universiti Sains Malaysia, (1001/PKOMP/814254)","The authors would like to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for supporting the publication of this paper through USM Research University Grant scheme 1001/PKOMP/814254.

In order to develop, adopt, and use an innovative application or system, the critical success factors are crucial. Consumer behaviours and adoption are crucial to the development of a proposed system based on the metaverse in order to improve the system's usefulness. Consequently, the goal of this study is to evaluate various theories, models, and previous research related to the innovation adoption in order to draw conclusions about the critical success factors for the adoption of the metaverse in education and consumer intention to use. © 2023, IGI Global.

Unfortunately, little attention is focused on the full identification of the cryptocurrency adoption factors, especially when it comes to emerging nations like Saudi Arabia. The current investigation is aimed at investigating whether the use of dual structural equation modelling and artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) would permit a better comprehension of the determinants of cryptocurrency adoption than the single-step PLS-SEM technique and explore the predictors of cryptocurrency adoption. An extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model was used. A sample of 344 responses from Saudi Arabian students at public universities was used to verify the model. Unlike the majority of existing studies that were based on a single-step PLS-SEM approach, this investigation employed a superior statistical approach, the dual SEM-ANN approach, considered a unique methodological approach that can recognise variables’ connections that are both linear and nonlinear and predict relationships with higher accuracy. Moreover, the dual SEM-ANN analysis revealed security as the most important factor influencing whether users would accept cryptocurrency, followed by effort expectancy and awareness. The application of the dual SEM-ANN technique and the extension of the UTAUT model with security and awareness constructs have enhanced the existing technology adoption literature. Additionally, methodological, theoretical, and practical contributions were offered by this study. Copyright © 2023 Ali S. A. Alomari and Nasuha L.

Diagnosing heart disease becomes an important task to reduce its sovereignty in its early stage. Machine learning methods remain the most widely used for the classification and detection processes. This work aims to design and identify a model that best classifies cardiovascular disease and predicts the presence or absence of the disease in patients using machine learning methods with accurate predictions. Therefore, this paper compares the five most powerful machine learning platforms to classify cardiovascular disease data. The proposed five different classifiers are are support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Logistic regression (LR), Decision tree (DT), and Naive Bayes (NB) for the classification of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

In order to maintain competitiveness, companies need to learn how to manage and leverage on the increase of complexity in their operations. This study seeks to understand the relationship between operational complexity and operational performance of E and E industry in Malaysia. This survey-based study registered a response rate of 17.8% with 111 usable data. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) technique was applied to analyze the data. Operational complexity consists of two dimensions, namely, complicatedness and uncertainty. Meanwhile, operational performance has four dimensions of cost, quality, delivery and flexibility. Both variables are multi-dimensional and modeled as formative second order in PLS-SEM. Results of structural model reveal that operational complexity has a positive impact on operational performance which indicate that the higher the operational complexity, the better the performance. Based on Complex Adaptive System (CAS) in complexity science literature, the relationship between performance and complexity is an inverse U shape curve. This implies that, high operational complexity needs to be managed so as not to reach the threshold of a chaotic stage, which will affect performance. The finding provides insights for managers to cope with increasing operational complexity and to improve performance in the current fast-moving business environment. It also contributes to knowledge in complexity science. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Electrical and electronics; Manufacturing; Operational complexity; Operational performance","","","","","","School of Computer Sciences; Univeristi Sains Malaysia","The authors would like to thank School of Computer Sciences, Univeristi Sains Malaysia for supporting the publication of this paper.","Ahmad M.F., Yusof S.M., Yusof N.M., Comparative Study Of Quality Practices Between Japanese And Non-Japanese Based Electrical And Electronics Companies In Malaysia: A Survey, Jurnal teknologi, 47, pp. 75-89, (2012); Arumugam V., Ooi K.-B., Fong T.-C., TQM practices and quality management performance: An investigation of their relationship using data from ISO 9001:2000 firms in Malaysia, The TQM Journal, 20, pp. 636-650, (2008); Bozarth C.C., Warsing D.P., Flynn B.B., Flynn E.J., The impact of supply chain complexity on manufacturing plant performance, Journal of Operations Management, 27, pp. 78-93, (2009); Brown D., Wilson S., The Black Book of Outsourcing, (2005); Calinescu A., Efstathiou J., Schirn J., Bermejo J., Applying and Assessing Two Methods for Measuring Complexity in Manufacturing, The Journal of the Operational Research Society, 49, pp. 723-733, (1998); Carlisle Y., McMillan E., Innovation in organizations from a complex adaptive systems perspective, Emergence: Complexity and Organization, 8, pp. 2-9, (2006); Ferdows K., De Meyers A., Lasting Improvements in Manufacturing Performance : In Search of a New Theory, Journal of Operations Management, 9, pp. 168-184, (1990); Flynn B.B., Flynn E.J., Information-Processing Alternatives for Coping with Manufacturing Environment Complexity, Decision Sciences, 30, pp. 1021-1052, (1999); FMM Directory 2011: Malaysian Industries Malaysia, (2011); Fotopoulos C.V., Psomas E.L., The structural relationships between TQM factors and organizational performance, The TQM Journal, 22, pp. 539-552, (2010); Frizelle G., Woodcock E., Measuring complexity as an aid to developing operational strategy, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 15, pp. 26-39, (1995); Galbraith J., Designing Complex Organizations, Reading, (1973); Hair J., Hult G.T.M., Ringle C., Sarstedt M., A Primer on Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), (2014); Islam M., Karim A., Manufacturing practices and performance: Comparison among small-medium and large industries, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 28, pp. 43-61, (2011); MacKenzie S.B., Podsakoff P.M., Jarvis C.B., The problem of measurement model misspecification in behavioral and organizational research and some recommended solutions, Journal of Applied Psychology, 90, (2005); Mahmud N., Hilmi M.F., TQM and Malaysian SMEs Performance: The Mediating Roles of Organization Learning, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 130, pp. 216-225, (2014); Electrical and Electronics, (2014); McKelvey B., Self-organization, complexity catastrophe, and microstate models at the edge of chaos, Variations in organization science: in honor of Donald T., pp. 279-307, (1999); Malaysian EMS Advantage, (2007); Malaysia Investment Performance Report 2013.

However, the recent spate of recalls due to CM poor quality control have triggered the calls to include quality risks as one of the main factors in outsourcing decisions. This paper proposes a conceptual model to implement effective QM practices in the setting of CM industry in Malaysia. Operational complexity (OC) has been identified as the contextual factor in the QM practices-performance model. It is based on contingency theory that implementation of effective QM practices are contextual to organization and not universal.

The UTAUT model was enhanced with the incorporation of security and awareness to develop the theoretical model for this investigation. The paper investigates the impact of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating condition, social influence, security, and awareness on the behavioral intention to use Cryptocurrency. The moderating role of financial literacy was also investigated on the associations between the proposed adoption factors and the behavioral intention to use Cryptocurrency. SmartPLS 3.2.8 software was used to analyse 344 responses collected via an online survey. The Findings showed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, security, and awareness positively impact on behavioral intention to use Cryptocurrency. Moreover, financial literacy moderates the associations between performance expectancy, security, social influence, and behavioral intention. The findings offer valuable insights to Cryptocurrency users, Cryptocurrency developers, and the government of the KSA. © 2023 The Author(s).

A preliminary study was done to explore the state of OSS implementation among government agencies since the launch of the Malaysian Public Sector OSS Master Plan on July 16, 2004. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews using open-ended questions were conducted with IT managers and IT officers in the Northern Region of Peninsular Malaysia. The preliminary study aimed at investigating the usage of OSS and proprietary software, the level of OSS utilisation, the level of OSS knowledge and training of ICT and non-ICT staff, software development and acquisition model, internal OSS manpower capabilities and skills, the user's perception of the advantages of OSS, the user's perception of the risks of OSS, and the problems or barriers in OSS implementation. The results of interviews show that there are many problems or barriers in OSS implementation, e.g. lack of internal OSS expertise, lack of OSS policy, and lack of top management support. Therefore, this study will test the hypotheses on the success factors to OSS implementation in the public sector and to propose a framework for successful OSS implementation in the Malaysian Public Sector. A quantitative approach using survey method via questionnaire will be performed to answer the research question where simple random sampling will be used. The target respondents are the IT managers and IT officers among the sampling frame of 192 public sector agencies in Malaysia that have successfully implemented at least three OSS solution areas. © 2016 IEEE.","Malaysian Public Sector OSS Master Plan; Open Source Software (OSS); OSS solution areas; simple random sampling; successful OSS implementation","Computer software; Managers; Open systems; Personnel training; Risk perception; Software design; Software engineering; Surveys; Face-to-face interview; Malaysian public sectors; Master plan; OSS solution areas; Simple random sampling; Software development and acquisitions; successful OSS implementation; Top management support; Open source software","","","","","","","Varian H.R., Shapiro C., Linux adoption in the public sector: An economic analysis, Manuscript, (2003); Rossi B., Russo B., Succi G., Adoption of free/libre open source software in public organizations: Factors of impact, Information Technology & People, 25, 2, (2012); Maldonado E., The process of introducing floss in the public administration: The case of Venezuela, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 11, 11, pp. 756-783, (2010); Kamau J., Namuye S., A review of users adoption of open source software in Africa, Computer and Information Science, 5, 5, (2012); Malaysian Public Sector Open Source Software Programme Phase II Benefit Realisation Report (BRR), (2010); Thomas J., Open source software: An enabler of Malaysia's vision 2020 transformation, EDITORIAL COMMITTEE, (2010); Harian B., OSS Jimat Perbelanjaan Kerajaan RM370j; Open source system proves effective in public sector, New Straits Times; OSS Adoption Statistics (Malaysian Public Sector Open Source Software Programme); Haider A., Open Source Software Utilization in Australian State Governments, (2008); Haider A., Koronios A., Promises of open source software for australian government agencies-an exploratory study, PACIS 2009 Proceedings, (2009); Jayawardena S., Dias G., Free and open source software for public sector enterprise applications in Sri Lanka, International Conference on Information Management and Evaluation, pp. 239-249, (2011); Johnston K., Begg S., Tanner M., Exploring the factors influencing the adoption of Open Source Software in Western Cape schools, International Journal of Education & Development Using Information & Communication Technology, 9, 2, pp. 64-84, (2013); Mtsweni J., Biermann E., An investigation into the implementation of open source software within the SA government: An emerging expansion model, Proceedings of the 2008 Annual Research Conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists on IT Research in Developing Countries: Riding the Wave of Technology, pp. 148-158, (2008); Mutula S., Kalaote T., Open source software deployment in the public sector: A review of Botswana and South Africa, Library Hi Tech, 28, 1, pp. 63-80, (2010); Oram A., Promoting open source software in government: The challenges of motivation and follow-through, Journal of Information Technology & Politics, 8, 3, pp. 240-252, (2011); Richter D., Zo H., Maruschke M., A comparative analysis of open source software usage in Germany, Brazil, and India, Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology, 2009.

Most companies focus on the efficiency of their manufacturing operation and overlooked the importance of managing the Quality Assurance (QA) operation efficiently. QA holds the key to delivery; hence an efficient and effective QA buyoff system is crucial to ensure the company delivers on time. Efficient QA operation requires accurate and reliable inspection data. Therefore, information technology (IT) has to be deployed. This paper identifies the problems in the daily operation, proposes a computerized solution and discusses the benefits of using IT to improve the efficiency of QA operation of a SME in Prai, Penang.

Recently, automated checkout shopping trolley technologies have taken a further step than the previous introduced self-checkout system in terms of greater convenience, ease-of-use and greater efficiency. As this technology is considerable new in the market of developing countries, hence it is vital to explore the perception of consumers toward the use of automated checkout trolley. The purpose of this paper is to understand the perceptions and expectations of both enterprise users and end users toward the new checkout system. Findings of this study indicate that both consumers and retailers from developing countries possess positive attitude toward the automated checkout trolley system, and are enthusiastic to try this emerging technology. The main concerns of the users are the secureness of payment and the variability of payment methods, which forms their core criteria in determining whether to adopt the system. The feedbacks from them are valuable in providing better automated checkout system and facilitate adoption rate of the technology.","Automated checkout; Technology management; Technology-based self-service (TBSS)","Developing countries; Sales; Technology; Automated checkout; Customer values; Ease-of-use; Emerging technologies; End users; Payment methods; Positive attitude; Technology managements; Technology-based; Trolley system; Automation","","","","","","","Anitsal I., Flint D.J., Exploring customers' perceptions in creating and delivering value: Technology-based self-service as an illustration, Services Marketing Quarterly, 27, 1, pp. 57-72, (2006); Anitsal I., Paige R.C., An exploratory study on consumer perceptions of service quality in technology-based self-service, Services Marketing Quarterly, 27, 3, pp. 53-67, (2006); Dabholkar P.A., Bobbitt L.M., Lee E.-J., Understanding consumer motivation and behavior related to self-scanning in retailing implications for strategy and research on technology-based self-service, International Journal of Service Industry Management, 14, 1, pp. 59-95, (2003); Hsieh C.-T., Implementing self-service technology to gain competitive advantage, Communications of IIMA, 5, pp. 77-83, (2005); Dabholkar P.A., Consumer evaluations of new technology-based self-service options: An investigation of alternative models of service quality, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 13, 1, pp. 29-51, (1996); Cho H., Fiorito S., Self-service technology in retailing.

Neurological rehabilitation, also known as neurorehabilitation, is part of the rehabilitation process that improves function, reduces severity and enhances a patient’s well-being. Because neurological injuries occur in the brain, spine and nerves, affecting multiple body parts including organs, blood vessels, muscles and bones, rehabilitation requires a multidisciplinary approach. This study conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on the use of mobile game in neurorehabilitation. The steps undertaken in the literature review included the collection, identification, categorisation, summarisation and synthesis of relevant studies in the research domain. A total of 50 related articles were reviewed. The study identified that the effects on cognitive skills, handgrip strength, memory, attention, visuospatial abilities, executive function tasks, motor functionality, and improvements in balance, visual perception, and functional mobility are impacts of the use of mobile games in neurological rehabilitation. Furthermore, several research challenges and recommendations for future research were identified. © 2023, Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia.

The new, linked virtual world ushers in an easy and unrestricted movement of data, cash, ideas, goods, and people. It is projected that the usage of the metaverse in education would upend current learning methodologies since it will increase learning strategies, the use of technology, and the options available to students, educators, and education providers. Nevertheless, there are presently few systematic studies on how scholars used immersive virtual reality for academic purposes that noted the use of both expensive and inexpensive head-mounted displays. Therefore, this chapter aims to examine virtual reality and Eduverse from a historical and technological standpoint. The success of virtual reality in education will primarily depend on how motivated students, as the main consumers, become and their capacity to recognise the key components required to reach a suitable degree of learning through virtual reality. © 2023, IGI Global.

Paying bills/loans from multiple bank accounts in a single login would provide greater convenience. This paper reviewed the current on line banking system and discussed the challenges in designing an integrated web based application for independent personal financial organizer called I-PFO. I-PFO allows users to settle their financial commitments from multiple banks in a single website. It also provides ease of use, tracking due dates, organizing and personalization. The challenges of such system are security, value proposition to attract collaboration from banks and user acceptance. This paper focuses on security solutions for I-PFO. © 2010 IEEE.","Integrated one-stop solution; Integrated web application; Multiple online banking; Personalized financial organizer; Security solution","Information technology; World Wide Web; Integrated one-stop solution; On-line banking; Personalized financial organizer; Security solutions; WEB application; Finance","","","","","","","Cronin M.J., Banking and Finance on the Internet, (1997); Kirky, Online Banking Exceeds 50% Usage by Internet User, (2010); Yee Y.Y., Yeow P.H.P., User acceptance of internet banking service in Malaysia, WEBIST 2008, pp. 295-306, (2009); Poon, Users' adoption of E-banking services: The Malaysian perspective, Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing, 23, 1, pp. 59-69, (2008); Poon, Tan, Spread of E-banking in Malaysia: A consumer perspective, The ICFAI University Journal of Bank Management, 9, 4, pp. 71-84; SOAP-based Transfer of Data, (2004); Hada S., SOAP Security Extension: Digital Signature, (2001); Gollmann D., E-commerce security, Computing & Control Engineering Journal, 11, (2000); Khusial D., McKegney R., (2005); Introducing the IBM Security Framework and IBM Security Blueprint to realize Business-driven Security, IBM Redguide, (2009); VeriSign Identity Protection (VIP) Network, (2010); Secure Socket Layer (SSL): How It Works, (2010); Li B., Xu C., E-commerce security risk analysis and management strategies of commercial banks, International Forum on Information Technology and Applications, 1, (2009); Zhang H., Weber G., Zhu W., Thomborson C., B2B E-Commerce Security Modeling: A Case Study, 2, (2006); Qingping G., Li F., Li Y., Probe into E-commerce security technology, 2009 International Forum on Computer Science-Technology and Applications, 2, (2009)","A.

Various studies related to obesity have been done; however, there is still a need to predict the possibility of losing obese patient's weight based on history of his/her diet and exercise data. Therefore, this study use an obese patient as the case study. Diet and exercise data was collected using Smartwatch. This study classifies the obese patient's level of possibility to lose weight to high (Good health), medium (Normal) and low (Poor health) from the patient's diet and exercise data. Machine learning techniques such as k-nearest neighbour and decision tree are used in this study to classify the diet and exercise data and find out the level of possibility to reduce weight. Analysis of this study shows that the decision tree provides the best accuracy for diet and exercise data where it is recorded 71.54% and 63.63% respectively. On the other hand, k-nearest neighbour shows the accuracy of 65.85% for diet and 69.32% for exercise data. The prediction results of this study can be used by the doctors and physicians to provide better advice and prescription for the obese patients. © 2021 IEEE.","Classification; Decision Tree; Diet; Exercise; Habit Change; K-Nearest Neighbour; Machine Learning; mHealth; Obesity","Decision trees; Forecasting; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Nutrition; Coronary heart disease; K-nearest neighbours; Machine learning techniques; Respiratory disorders; Weight loss; Trees (mathematics)","","","","","Division of Research & Innovation; University of Southern Maine, USM, (304/PKOMP/6315435)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors are thankful to the School of Computer Sciences, and Division of Research & Innovation, USM for providing financial support from the Short Term Grant (304/PKOMP/6315435).","Jardine G., Obesity and dietary behavioural changes, Journal of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes of South Africa, 15, 2, pp. 88-90, (2010); Keikhosrokiani P., Perspectives in the Development of Mobile Medical Information Systems: Life Cycle, Management, Methodological Approach and Application (Perspectives in the Development of Mobile Medical Information Systems: Life Cycle, Management, Methodological Approach and Application), pp. 1-273, (2019); Augustine C.A., Keikhosrokiani P., A habit-change support web-based system with big data analytical features for hospitals (doctive), Cham, pp. 91-101, (2021); Ravichandran B.D., Keikhosrokiani P., An emotional-persuasive habit-change support mobile application for heart disease patients (behabit), Cham, pp. 252-262, (2021); Haslam D.W., James W.P.T., Obesity, The Lancet, 366, 9492, pp. 1197-1209, (2005); Keikhosrokiani P., Chapter 6-emotional-persuasive and habitchange assessment of mobile medical information systems (mmis), Perspectives in the Development of Mobile Medical Information Systems, pp. 101-109, (2020); Rautiainen I., Ayramo S., Predicting Overweight and Obesity in Later Life from Childhood Data: A Review of Predictive Modeling Approaches, (2019); Santorelli G., Et al., Developing prediction equations and a mobile phone application to identify infants at risk of obesity, PLoS One, 8, 8, (2013); Graversen L., Et al., Prediction of adolescent and adult adiposity outcomes from early life anthropometrics, Obesity, 23, 1, pp. 162-169, (2015); Weng S.F., Redsell S.A., Nathan D., Swift J.A., Yang M., Glazebrook C., Estimating overweight risk in childhood from predictors during infancy, Pediatrics, 132, 2, (2013); Morandi A., Meyre D., Lobbens S., Kleinman K., Kaakinen M., Estimation of newborn risk for child or adolescent obesity: Lessons from longitudinal birth cohorts, PLoS ONE, 7, 11, pp. 49919-49919, (2012); Redsell S.A., Weng S., Swift J.A., Nathan D., Glazebrook C., Validation, optimal threshold determination, and clinical utility of the infant risk of overweight checklist for early prevention of child overweight, Childhood Obesity, 12, 3, pp. 202-209, (2016); Druet C., Et al., Prediction of childhood obesity by infancy weight gain: An individual-level meta-analysis, Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology, 26, 1, pp. 19-26, (2012); Watts A.W., Masse L.C., Naylor P.J., Changes to the school food and physical activity environment after guideline implementation in British Columbia, Canada, International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, 11, 1, (2014); Lindvall K., Et al., Comparisons of weight change, eating habits and physical activity between women in northern Sweden and rural New York state-results from a longitudinal study, Nutrition Journal, 14, 1, (2015); Romeike K., Abidi L., Lechner L., De Vries H., Oenema A., Similarities and differences in underlying beliefs of socio-cognitive factors related to diet and physical activity in lower-educated Dutch, Turkish, and moroccan adults in the netherlands: A focus group study, BMC Public Health, 16, 1, (2016); Hattar A., Hagger M.S., Pal S., Weight-loss intervention using implementation intentions and mental imagery: A randomised control trial study protocol health behavior, health promotion and society, BMC Public Health, 15, 1, (2015); Farran B., AlWotayan R., Alkandari H., Al-Abdulrazzaq D., Channanath A., Thanaraj T.A., Use of non-invasive parameters and machine-learning algorithms for predicting future risk of type 2 diabetes: A retrospective cohort study of health data from Kuwait, Frontiers in Endocrinology, 10, (2019); Dunstan J., Bastias M., Nau C., Glass T.A., Tobar F., Predicting Nationwide Obesity from Food Sales Using Machine Learning, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2021 International Congress of Advanced Technology and Engineering, ICOTEN 2021","4 July 2021 through 5 July 2021","Virtual, Online","170704","","978-166541224-7","","","English","Int.
