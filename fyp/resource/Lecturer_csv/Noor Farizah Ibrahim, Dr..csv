It has changed the way how online community interacts and somehow has led to a new trend of engagement for online retailers especially on microblogging websites such as Twitter. In this study, we investigated the impact of online retailers’ engagement with the online brand communities on users’ perception of brand image and service. Firstly, we analysed the overall sentiment trends of different brands and the patterns of engagement between companies and customers using the collected tweets posted on a popular social media platform, Twitter. Then, we studied how different types of engagements affect customer sentiments. Our analysis shows that engagement has an effect on sentiments that associate with brand image, perception and customer service of the online retailers. Our findings indicate that the level, length, type and attitude of retailers’ engagement with social media users have a significant impact on their sentiments. Based on our results, we derived several important managerial and practical implications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Engagement; Microblogging; Online community; Online retailing; Social media","Electronic commerce;

In this paper, the estimated travel duration between bus stops was computed based on historical GPS data with time stamps. Three approaches were employed to compute the duration between bus stops: (i) statistical central tendencies, (ii) nonlinear regression techniques i.e., decision tree regressor, random forest regressor and k-nearest neighbors regressor, and (iii) an ANN predictive model. These three approaches capture different characteristics of the traffic environment. Statistical central tendencies give the overall view of the ETA information while nonlinear regressors can capture context from the time stamps (e.g., weekdays vs holidays). Finally, predicting the duration required to reach the next bus stop based on previous timespans on the same route implicitly captures temporal dynamics of the traffic environment from previous time steps and the ANN predictive model exploits this temporal information. The feasibility of ETA estimation using these three approaches was explained, evaluated and discussed.  © 2023 IEEE.","non-GPS-based ETA models; non-linear models; predictive models; traffic data analysis","Bus terminals; Bus transportation; Buses; Global positioning system; Intelligent systems; Nearest neighbor search; Bus stop; Central tendencies; GPS data; Non-GPS-based ETA model; Non-linear modelling; Nonlinear regression technique; Predictive models; Time-stamp; Traffic data analysis; Traffic environment; Decision trees","","","","","","","(2015); Mackensen E., Lai M., Wendt T.M., Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based wireless sensors, SENSORS, 2012, pp. 1-4, (2012); Gunady S., Keoh S.L., A non-GPS based location tracking of public buses using bluetooth proximity beacons, 2019 IEEE 5th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT), pp. 606-611, (2019); Yu H., Xiao R., Du Y., He Z., A Bus-Arrival Time Prediction Model Based on Historical Traffic Patterns, 2013 International Conference on Computer Sciences and Applications, pp. 345-349, (2013); Zhang X., Liu Z., Prediction of Bus Arrival Time based on GPS Data: Taking 6 Bus in Huangdao District of Qingdao City as an Example, 2019 Chinese Control Conference (CCC), pp. 8789-8794, (2019); Ye L., Thiengburanathum P., Thiengburanathum P., A Real-Time Bus Arrival Time Prediction System Based on Spark Framework and Machine Learning Approaches: A case study in Chiang Mai, 2021 Joint International Conference on Digital Arts, Media and Technology with ECTI Northern Section Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, Cha-am, Thailand, pp. 243-248, (2021); Jenelius E., Koutsopoulos H.N., Travel time estimation for urban road networks using low frequency probe vehicle data, Transp.

Nowadays, in the digital era, social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and blogs have generated a massive amount of text data in the form of messages, chats and posts. This phenomenon has led researchers to analyse the content of short messages (tweets) that contain political insights on Twitter. This study proposes a web-based application tool of real-time Twitter sentiment analysis (POPMON) which can be used to analyse public opinion and track the popularity of famous political candidates. In this study, politicians' Twitter accounts were selected, incorporating millions of Twitter users and real-time tweets (raw data) and gathered using a tweet crawler. Various text mining techniques were applied to the raw data for a pre-processing purpose. For instance, the Naïve Bayes algorithm was applied to the cleaned data to be classified into sentiment polarities such as positive, negative, or neutral. The findings enable a more thorough understanding of the political sentiment and the possible points of view regarding political candidates’ popularity. Finally, the political sentiments were visualised in graphical plot graph, doughnut chart and word cloud for a better analysis. These findings will aid politicians in improving their public service, assist political parties and their leaders on planning publicity campaigns and predict the outcomes of future elections to a certain extent. © SEARCH Journal 2021.","Naïve Bayes; Sentiment analysis; social media; Twitter","","","","","","","","Abdo A.

These services are driven by technologies that attempt to enhance how people manage their lives in more networked and interconnected ways. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of 103 articles published from year 1998 to 2014 by reviewing the research objectives, research findings, methodologies and research gaps of prior online service studies. Since, there are limited focus on online services research as a whole albeit several researchers concentrated specifically on areas such as e-banking and e-commerce, the authors summarized prior research by developing a unified framework - the Design for Online Service (DOS) framework-that synthesized the findings of success factors - web design, social networking, service provisioning, user involvement and critical success factors-in designing online services. The DOS framework provides a holistic view of determinants for the success of online service design, incorporating range set of factors and its criteria. Overall, these findings provide insights and greater understanding of online service research agenda. Copyright © 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Social media covers a wide spectrum of users and facilitates businesses in their operations by providing various services and interact with customers. As a result, a large amount of social media content is created and freely available on social media sites. In order to understand customers better, companies use this opportunity to monitor and analyse user-generated content related to their interactions, performances and at the same time provide comprehensive views on other competitors. In an effort to help companies understand how to perform social media analysis and transform the data into meaningful knowledge, this paper examines user-generated unstructured content on Twitter and Facebook sites of the three leading UK online retailers: Amazon, Asda and Tesco. Our analysis shows how topics, engagement, sentiment analysis of these data could be turn into knowledge, source of intelligence and useful for companies to improve businesses. We believe that the study of customer behaviours and interactions on social media site has its potential to extract valuable knowledge and pattern that can be beneficial to develop effective marketing strategies. The results will be discussed and implications will be drawn. © 2017 IEEE.","Data mining; Engagement; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Topic model","","","","","","","","","N.F.

The benefits of e-ticketing can reduce the human efforts, increase the sufficiency of system and provides the benefits and efficiency to the customers. Also, e-ticketing ticketing system can enhance worker safety, improving productivity, increasing project efficiency and cause the good impact on the performance of the business in terms of profitability. The main objective of this study is defining the model performance in each important feature by analysing the complex dataset by using logistic regression as a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm. In evaluation the performance of classifier, the dataset is injected to Python programming and split into 90% as training set and 10% for the testing set. From the analysis, the study found that only 3 out of 11 independent features in dataset that are relevant chosen to proceed the ML analysis. From the result, the accuracy for sct_short_description, sct_cmdb_ci, and sct_assignment_group is 41.65%, 48.77% and 96.49%, respectively. It showed that the accuracy’s result for the sct_assignment_group resulted that the model is very good accuracy and indicate that the model is well performing. Meanwhile, the value of F1-score is 96.11% in each feature. This result indicates that the model has a good balance of precision and recall in its binary classification predictions. Hence, the study considers the sct_assignment_group as a best features to proceed the analysis.

To overcome this challenge, various sources have been utilised including customer comments and reviews from social media to analyse their preference based on their interests and sharing. Numerous large e-Commerce web sites are now investing in recommender systems to ease their customers into recommending the relevant products that suit their preferences. However, there are still limitations within the existing recommender systems that are lacking in discovering the real sentiment values of how customers perceived the products or services offered. This study aims to develop a product recommender system that incorporates the sentiment values from customer post on social media and predict the top five recommended products using the Collaborative-Based filtering technique. The tweets were collected from top global and local retailers, Amazon and Shopee to understand the customer response from social media followed by the development of a recommender system for the customer. The findings of this study highlighted a total of 8 clusters such as electronics, entertainment, and books from the clustering experiment. The top 5 best seller product predictions for each category also showed a score of 0.59, which is higher than the threshold score in the evaluation stage. © 2023 IEEE.","Collaborative filtering; Content-based filtering; Recommendation System; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter","Collaborative filtering; Electronic commerce; Recommender systems; Sales; Social networking (online); Collaborative-based filtering; Content based filtering; E- commerces; Filtering technique; Preference-based; Product recommender system; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Twitter; Web-sites; Sentiment analysis","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (ICT06/USM/02/3)","This research is fully funded by the Minister of Higher Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS Reference Code - FRGS/1/2020/ICT06/USM/02/3).","Rahman M.M., Prity S.K., Bari Z.A., Machine Learning approach for Item-basedMovie Recommendation using the most relevant similarity techniques, 2021 3rd International Congress on Human-Computer Interaction, Optimization and Robotic Applications (HORA), pp. 1-4, (2021); Sharma D., Sabharwal M., Goyal V., Vij M., Sentiment analysis techniques for social media data: A review, First international conference on sustainable technologies for computational intelligence, pp. 75-90, (2020); Althbiti A., Model-Based Learning to Augment Collaborative Filtering: Prediction and Evaluation, (2021); Jemai F., Hayouni M., Baccar S., Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning Algorithms, 2021 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC), pp. 775-779, (2021); Kundi F.M., Khan A., Ahmad S., Asghar M.Z., Lexicon-based sentiment analysis in the social web, Journal of Basic and Applied Scientific Research, 4, 6, pp. 238-248, (2014); Hutto C., Gilbert E., Vader: A parsimonious rule-based model for sentiment analysis of social media text, Proceedings of the international AAAI conference on web and social media, 8, 1, pp. 216-225, (2014); Gupta M., Thakkar A., Gupta V., Rathore D.P.S., Movie recommender system using collaborative filtering, 2020 International Conference on Electronics and Sustainable Communication Systems (ICESC), pp. 415-420, (2020); Khatter H., Goel N., Gupta N., Gulati M., Movie Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity with Sentiment Analysis, 2021 Third International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA), pp. 597-603, (2021); Zahrawi M., Mohammad A., Implementing recommender systems using machine learning and knowledge discovery tools, Knowledge-Based Engineering and Sciences, 2, 2, pp. 44-53, (2021); Gupta S., Sentiment Analysis: Concept, Analysis and Applications; MAP at K: An Evaluation Metric For Ranking","","Lee S.; Choo H.; Ismail R.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","17th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication, IMCOM 2023","3 January 2023 through 5 January 2023","Seoul","186610","","978-166545348-6","","","English","Proc.

This study collects tweets associated with five leading UK online retailers covering the period from Black Friday to Christmas and New Year's sales. We use a combination of text analytical approaches including topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and network analysis to analyse the tweets. Through the analysis, we identify that delivery, product and customer service are among the most-discussed topics on Twitter. We also highlight the areas that receive the most negative customer sentiments such as delivery and customer service. Interestingly, we also identify emerging topics such as online engagement and in-store experience that are not captured by the existing literature on online retailing. Through a network analysis, we underscore the relationships among those important topics. This study derives insights on how well the leading online retail brands are performing and how their products and services are perceived by their customers. These insights can help businesses understand customers better and enable them to convert the information into meaningful knowledge to improve their business performance. The study offers a novel approach of transforming social media data into useful knowledge about online retailing. The incorporation of three analytical approaches offers insights for researchers to understand the hidden content behind the large collections of unstructured bodies of text, and this information can be used to improve online retailing services and reach out to customers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Online retailing; Sentiment analysis; Social media research; Text analytics; Topic modelling","Data mining; Metadata; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Analytical approach; Business performance; Negative customers; Online retailing; Products and services; Service improvement; Social media; Text analytics; Sales","","","","","Government of Malaysia; Newton Fund; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Royal Society; National Eye Research Centre, NERC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding text 1: This research is partially funded by the Government of Malaysia .  ; Funding text 2:  Xiaojun Wang is a Professor of Operations Management in the School of Economics, Finance and Management, University of Bristol.

Industry 4.0 calls for transformation and effective talent development is vital in ensuring national aspirations are achieved while eliminating redundancy and ensuring consistency. As such, this study aims to understand the impact of Industry 4.0 on computer engineering-related workforce and skills development within Multinational Companies (MNCs) to Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. In this study, online questionnaires were distributed to evaluate the current and future hiring trends. The study reveals that most of the employees have positive perceptions about the industrial current practice on Industry 4.0 and identified the prospective demands on the professions that will be affected. Five significant areas of required competencies found in this study are adaptability, soft skills, software engineering, data analytics, and technical skills. The findings provide empirical evidence about current and future employment scenarios in Malaysia concerning the possible impact of Industry 4.0 on the companies and issues involved in managing the transition to Industry 4.0. Besides, the emergent skills required by workforces that are previously unaddressed in the literature were identified. Empirical evidence from the analysis contributes to shaping the educational systems of the future and helps to proactively identify specific skills shortages at an early stage. © The Author(s) 2022.","future talents;

However, despite the enormous quantity of tweets regarding online retailing, we know little about customers’ perceptions regarding the products and services offered by online retail brands. Therefore, this study focuses on analysing brand-related tweets associated with five leading UK online retailers during the most important sales period of the year, covering Black Friday, Christmas and the New Year's sales events. We explore trends in customer tweets by utilising a combination of data analytics approaches including time series analysis, sentiment analysis and topic modelling to analyse the trends of tweet volume and sentiment and to understand the reasons underlying changes in sentiment. Through the sentiment and time series analyses, we identify several critical time points that lead to significant deviations in sentiment trends. We then use a topic modelling approach to examine the tweets in the period leading up to and following these critical moments to understand what exactly drives these changes in sentiment. The study provides a deeper understanding of online retailing customer behaviour and derives significant managerial insights that are useful for improving online retailing service provision. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Big data analytics; Online retailing; Service provision; Social media; Time series","Big data; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Harmonic analysis; Sales; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Time series; Critical moment; Current events; Customer behaviour; Online retailing; Online retails; Products and services; Service provisions; Social media; article; big data; human; social media; time series analysis; Time series analysis","","","","","Government of Malaysia","This research is partially funded by the Government of Malaysia .

Considering the different interests of group members, the recommendation service for a group is more challenging than the common personalized recommendation. In essence, group recommendation interaction data is a typical heterogeneous graph structure. Therefore, the two challenges to this research are 1) how to learn the representation of groups, users, and items from interaction graphs and social relationship graphs, and 2) how to aggregate the representation of groups, users, and items from these graphs. In this research, we proposed a novel end-to-end Social enhancement Group Recommendation via Light graph convolution networks (SoLGR) to address those challenges. Specifically, we first utilize the meta-path to explore the potential social relationship from the user's perspective. Afterward, SoLGR deploys a light graph convolution operation on interactive graphs and metapath-based graphs to aggregate the embedding of groups, users, and items on each graph. Finally, the representations of different layers are accumulated and used to achieve predictions for both groups and users. The experimental results show that our proposed model significantly improves the group recommendation performance on two real-world datasets. © 2013 IEEE.","graph neural network; Group recommendation; social enhancement; SoLGR","Aggregates; Convolution; Graph neural networks; Graphic methods; Online systems; Recommender systems; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Convolutional neural network; Decisions makings; Graph neural networks; Group recommendations; Group users; Social enhancement; Social networking (online); Social relationships; SoLGR; Decision making","","","","","Department of Education, Fujian Province, (JAT190996)","This work was supported by the Young Teachers' Education and Research Fund of the Education Department of Fujian Province, China, under Grant JAT190996.","Ko H., Lee S., Park Y., Choi A., A survey of recommendation systems: Recommendation models, techniques, and application fields, Electronics, 11, 1, (2022); Wang H., Zhao M., Xie X., Li W., Guo M., Knowledge graph convolutional networks for recommender systems, Proc.

The news is about Philae, a robotic lander from the European Space Agency (ESA), which successfully made the first-ever rendezvous and touchdown of its kind on a comet nucleus on November 12, 2014. In order to understand how Twitter is practically used in spreading messages on historical events, we conducted an analysis of one-week of tweet feeds that contain the #CometLanding hashtag. We studied the trends of tweets, the diffusion of the information and the characteristics of the social network created. The results indicated that the use of Twitter as a platform enables online communities to engage and spread the historic event through social media network (e.g. tweets, retweets, mentions and replies). In addition, it was found that comprehensible and understandable hashtags could influence users to follow the same tweet stream compared to other laborious hashtags that were difficult to understand on social media. © 2017 IEEE.","Diffusion of information; Hashtag; Social media; Twitter","","","","","","","","""Tagboard.Com Website."", (2014); Aharony N., Twitter Use by Three Political Leaders: An Exploratory Analysis, Online Information Review, 36, 4, pp. 587-603, (2012); Arakawa Y., Et al., Adding Twitter-Specific Features to Stylistic Features for Classifying Tweets by User Type and Number of Retweets, Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 65, 7, pp. 1416-1423, (2014); Boyd D., Golder S., Lotan G., Tweet, Tweet, Retweet: Conversational Aspects of Retweeting on Twitter, Proceedings of the 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences 2010.

As a result, all these data and information can be easily or exclusively found on the Internet by the public. However, little is known yet about how to turn this data into useful knowledge and the collection of the data has not been sufficiently researched, especially in the online retail industry. In an effort to help companies in the online retail industry to utilise the data, this paper explores social network-generated contents on Twitter sites through topics identification that can subsequently facilitate companies to improve their services and performances. This paper describes a study based on data gathered on the Twitter sites of the leading UK retailers: Amazon, Argos and Tesco, during the periods of Black Friday, Boxing Day and Christmas in the UK. We chose Twitter as a platform because, whilst other previous works addressed online reviews and website contents in their studies, microblogs are just starting to be explored due to their characters' limitations and informal content making it harder to interpret. In this paper, we infer topics from short-Text tweets posted by customers mentioning brand names by employing a machine learning approach. We then analyse the tweets to determine the primary issues or topics focused by customers regarding these online retail brands by interpreting the themes of the specific keywords set represented. The topics which emerge based on the collection of tweet posts contribute to various aspects of companies' operations, such as delivery, customer service and product performance. We believe that this study derives some implications and insights for online retail brand companies in improving their service provisions, especially in customer service management. Insights on such topics can be beneficial in numerous ways, such as marketing, innovation and public image.","Data Mining; Machine Learning; Online Retailing; Social Media; Topic Model; Twitter","Artificial intelligence; Costs; Data mining; E-learning; Information management; Information systems; Learning systems; Sales; Websites; Machine learning; Service industry; Turing machines; Customer service management; Machine learning approaches; Online retailing; Social media; Social media networks; Topic Modeling; Topics identifications; Twitter; Data and information; Product performance; Service provisions; Web site contents; Social networking (online)","","","","","Government of Malaysia; University of Bristol Alumni Foundation","Supported by the University of Bristol Alumni Foundation and the Government of Malaysia.","Abbasi A., Chen H., Thoms S., Fu T., Affect analysis of web forums and blogs using correlation ensembles, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 20, 9, pp. 1168-1180, (2008); Berthon P.R., Pitt L.F., Plangger K., Shapiro D., Marketing meets Web 2.0, social media, and creative consumers: Implications for international marketing strategy, Business Horizons, 55, 3, pp. 261-271, (2012); Beykikhoshk A., Arandjelovi O., Phung D., Venkatesh S., Caelli T., Using Twitter to learn about the autism community, Social Network Analysis and Mining, 5, 1, (2015); Bian J., Yoshigoe K., Hicks A., Yuan J., He Z., Xie M., Modave M.F., Mining Twitter to Assess the Public Perception of the ""internet of Things, PLoS One, 11, 7, (2016); Blackshaw P., Nazzaro M., Consumer-generated media (CGM) 101 Word-of-mouth in the age of the webfortified consumer, New York: Nielsen BuzzMetrics, (2006); Cawsey T., Rowley J., Social media brand building strategies in B2B companies, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 34, 6, pp. 754-776, (2016); Collier J.E., Bienstock C.C., How do customers judge quality in an e-Tailer?, MIT Sloan Management Review, 48, 1, pp. 35-40, (2006); Dokoohaki N., Matskin M., Mining Divergent Opinion Trust Networks Through Latent Dirichlet Allocation, (2012); Feng Y., Lapata M., Topic models for image annotation and text illustration, Paper Read at Human Language Technologies: The 2010 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, (2010); Fong S., Zhuang Y., Li J., Khoury R., Sentiment analysis of online news using mallet, Paper Read at International Symposium on Computational and, (2013); Francis J.E., Internet retailing quality: One size does not fit all, Managing Service Quality: An International Journal, 17, 3, pp. 341-355, (2007); Griffiths T.L., Steyvers M., Finding scientific topics, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 101, pp. 5228-5235, (2004); Guo L., Vargo C.J., Pan Z., Ding W., Ishwar P., Big social data analytics in journalism and mass communication, Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 93, 2, pp. 332-359, (2016); Haghighi A., Vanderwende L., Exploring content models for multi-document summarization, Paper Read at Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, (2009); Ibrahim N.F., Wang X., Bourne H., Exploring the effect of user engagement in online brand communities: Evidence from Twitter, Computers in Human Behavior, 72, pp. 321-338, (2017); Kaplan A.M., Haenlein M., Users of the world, unite!

As a seller or marketer, it is important to understand what customer thinks and feel about products or services offered by the companies. This study aims to explore the sentiments of public opinion and understand the reason behind it through sentiment analysis and topic modelling approach. The first objective of this study is to analyse customer perceptions and sentiments towards multilevel marketing (MLM) company’s product. Then, the second objective is to identify the primary topics of concern regarding the products shared on social media. To achieve these objectives, customer reviews were collected from multiple platforms such as social media namely Twitter, online web review i.e., Moutshut.com, Trustpilot, sitejabber.com, and e-commerce websites such as Amazon, Lazada and Shopee. Other than that, a survey was also conducted to triangulate the data and to get first-hand feedback and review from the customers. In this study, the reviews were analysed using sentiment analysis and topic modelling techniques: Valance Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER), Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) packages, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The findings of the study revealed that over 50% of the reviews were positive and customers were mostly shared about the product quality such as the originality, delivery and product packaging in their reviews. This study offers some insight about public perceptions towards the products from MLM company and at the same time helps in improving the products and services globally and locally. © IEOM Society International.","Product review; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Topic modelling; Twitter","","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (ICT06/USM/02/3)","This research is fully funded by the Minister of Higher Education Malaysia under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS Reference Code - FRGS/1/2020/ICT06/USM/02/3).","Adarsh R, Comparison of VADER and LSTM for Sentiment Analysis, International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering (IJRTE), pp. 540-543, (2019); Blei D.
